9J9-D_VjSMA,OR,2-5-2014,i'd like to open the house committee on human services and housing on wednesday february 5th 2014 and we will open up the um public hearing and open the workstation and work session on house bill 1438 carried over from uh the third of february so representative nathanson is she here oh there she is good representative thank you so much i know how hard you've been working on this [Music] good afternoon madam chair members of the committee i'm nancy nathanson state representative from house district 13 and representative wisnin is with me again this afternoon i i'm going to say just a few words and my colleague will say just a few more after we met with your committee and provided information to you we indicated that we would go back and do a little more work we brought the stakeholders together that very evening spent over an hour and made additional accommodations to meet additional concerns several were to clarify wording one is quite a substantive accommodation to the owners of the parks and we're very pleased that we were able to get those accommodations and changes made and turned around very quickly we believe we have a very good product when representative wisnet and i were talking earlier this morning there was an observation that no one is 100 happy i'm not happy about this you're not happy about that but what i can tell you is overall i'm very happy because i think we've done something good for oregonians and something important and we have also met our commitment to you to work with all the parties and reach a compromised negotiated agreement thank you and i did i kept you out of this loop here you were supposed to tell us what it was about right i'm sorry for the rest of the audience who probably has no idea what we're talking about the nom chair members of the committee the bill was previously summarized at a hearing public hearing on monday and the parties are returning on the carryover there is a new amendment a dash 3 amendment i apologize to the committee i the items that were received today i haven't had time to summarize so the parties will have to speak to that and that is as i understand it the the compromise amendment the dash three amendment right madam chair and committee members good afternoon uh gene wisner state representative house district 53 uh i concur with what representative nathan said we did work hard monday afternoon after the chair agreed to let us have more time to do one more chance at it i think we made some good strides again trying to to address the issues of the owners and the tenants and i think mr van laningham is going to speak uh he has a lot more information i'd like him to speak especially we agreed that instead of trying to overwrite it in the in the bill he's gonna put on the record some intent of legislative intent on what certain words meant and i think that's important so we do have that on the record so if people go back and start arguing about what was the legislative intent we can we'll have that on the record as again as representative nathan said i wish we could have had all agreement i would like to read a note from mr griff who was an attorney for the oregon park owners association and he worked hard with us that evening trying to find compromise but he sent us an email saying that it without further amendments that he had submitted uh his organization still could not support the bill uh so and he has other things he would like to do but we we got three out of four of the main player stakeholders in agreement and as representative nathan said i i think it's a better bill that was all that was on record and i think it was a better bill than this committee heard uh last session so we together would like to recommend the committee approve house bill 4038-3 which has the two major things and two small things that we put in the bill monday night agreed to do that's in the dash three and also our legislative council is working hard and long hours and uh harrison conley was our lc member on that and he worked hard with us that night and gave us the draft the next morning of the bill so appreciate that good thank you so much any questions or any questions yes i just want to thank both of you so much for bringing this together kind of year after year and getting to this point and and to the lc and to the players who did contribute to getting to a win-win on this there's a lot of hard work and a lot of give on a lot of a lot of different parties parts i really want to thank you both thank you representative any other comments yes thank you madam chair for recognizing me um i hope you will use your authority to we we need a work group we need to study this and we need more meetings so we have three people signed up to speak and what we're hoping to hear is about the amendment we've heard the bill many many times we've heard from the speakers who have investments in this so we just like to hear the amendment and then we don't have all the paperwork yet but we intend to pass this bill by three uh 4 45 today so thank you john landing ben carpenter and charlie grief am i pronouncing that charlie griff i'm sorry and just identify yourself please [Music] hello i'm chuck carpenter executive director of manufactured housing communities of oregon i think i'll to refer to these other two gentlemen for their comments just like to reiterate that manufactured housing communities of war again supports the three um amendments and uh we're happy that you're going to move the bill today great and chuck can you just remind us how many park owners you're representing and how about how many spaces are you representing it would represent about 489 communities in the state of oregon and that's about close to 30 000 spaces and in addition to that we have about 25 associate members who are attorneys management companies um vendors to the manufactured housing community industry and we do about five seminars a year and we have a national conference in eugene two days conference in eugene every year great thank you chad john thank you madam chair members of the committee my name is john van landing and i work as a legal aid lawyer in eugene for in lane county um and i obviously am here to support the bill could i ask cheyenne do you know whether the things i emailed you last night are on olus from here mr van linden both documents thank you um so i'm going to refer to uh two documents that i've given you that aren't are on full list and one is my amended detailed summary of the bill knowing that you've all studied it very carefully the point of that reference is that i've highlighted on that handout the changes that are substantive that are reflected in the dash three so i think my first responsibility here and uh working with representative wiznet is to explain to you what's different from what we talked about on monday and what we have before you today in dash three there were a number about six small changes things like removing commas adding the word legal in front of capacity legal capacity to do something that we discussed on monday night and that legislative council implemented for us um i don't consider those substantive changes i there's a sort of wordsmithing that make things hopefully work better in the future but there are two substantive changes that were raised by mr graf's group that we did agree on monday night one of them i would say i agree to unhappily but that's the point of compromise um to give things up uh and in order to move forward so those two changes uh both have to do with the confidentiality agreement you will remember that the way this process is designed to work here is comparable to private market transactions in which the landlord gives governor park owner gives notice to residents the residents have 10 days to decide whether they want to try to compete to buy the park if they do they have to give written notice back to the owner saying that they do that during that period they can ask for financial information we've specified what financial information they can ask for it's tended to be what's called a broker's package what a seller of a park typically would give to a buyer so the buyer can evaluate the sale one of the things the bill does that's very important to landlords that addresses a concern the landlords have had during the five years that chuck and i and others have negotiated this crazy issue um has to do with confidentiality of that financial information they have some legitimate concerns that an abusive tenant could abuse them with that financial information so the bill goes to considerable lengths to specify that the landlord can make that information confidential can make them require sign something called a confidentiality agreement can limit who can see who can see that information require them to give it back to them prevent them from making copies blah blah blah but there were two things that mr graf's group pointed out one of them i agreed with last week to strengthen that ability of a landlord to make it confidential the first is to make clear that if the tenants violate the confidentiality agreement deals off the landlord has no further obligation to do anything that's also one of the other main values of that bill is to say the tenants don't meet the deadlines if they don't uh comply with the purchase and sale agreement um the deal's off landlord has no further obligation to do anything so it was a good change to clarify that violating the confidentiality agreement also would be a basis for the landlord to say the deal's off the second change the one that i wasn't too happy to give up was to say that there's a remedy for a tenant who violates that confidentiality agreement in a substantial way the landlord would be entitled to recover from the tenant um actual damages that the landlord could prove previously i've argued that the ability of the landlord to just say that's it no the deal is off world table is the biggest club an owner has for tenant compliance but um the argument was that that's not equivalent to the tenant remedy and so there should be each side should have some remedy so those are the two substantial changes really in between the dash one and the dash three any questions about that before i go on so i'm talking fast uh uh representative also asked me to address a couple of things that we discussed on monday night where i said i don't think we need to change the bill for those things and here's why and i'm not i'm going to try to avoid being too wonky lawyerly here but the first has to do if you've got the bill in front of you with on page one of the bill line uh 13 in section one the main thing that the tenants actually get out of this agreement is that landlords have to give the tenants all the tenants a notice saying the landlord's interested in selling or is considering an offer to buy from somebody else um that is not clear current law is actually kind of confusing about that provision that idea although it does talk about a notice so here the phrase says that the landlord has to give loan ownership give the notice required but the first section to all tenants of the park and representative wiznet and some others have raised the concern that what if the landlord doesn't know who all the tenants are what if the landlord can't find all the tenants what if there is an absentee owner who owns the manufacturing home and rents it out to somebody else what if the tenant is a snowbird in arizona my response is we don't need to change that language mainly because oregon law already addresses how for all tenants and landlords in all residential tenancies and these are residential tendencies identifies how a landlord gives notice the landlord's duty in every case and there are dozens of statutes in chapter 90 that talk about landlords shall give notice tenant shall give notice we define what it means to give notice and it is simply to deliver a notice not to ensure that the tenant gets the notice there is no obligation on the landlord to prove that the tenant ever got the notice it is simply to either deliver it in person one mail to the tenant at the last known address which in this case is obviously going to be the manufactured home in the park or nate what's called nail and mail in which if you don't want to mail it you can vote i mean if you mail it you have to add three days but if you don't want to add three days you can simply attach a copy to the front door of the manufactured home and mail a copy by first class mail you're done whether the tenant ever gets it doesn't matter it's not it's not a legal defense for the tenant to say i didn't get the notice landlord duty is already a mail secondly i would point out that um landlords generally in my experience don't have trouble finding tenants for notices like with rent increases so i don't think it's going to be an issue in terms of finding tenants to give that notice and finally we actually talked about this in the work group and the draft the november 19th mostly agreed upon a proposal by most of the parties at the table actually provides for the first time uh in the latter town act a provision saying that if there's a minor error in giving of the notice it doesn't make the landlord liable for anything it doesn't prevent a sale to another party okay so you we don't need to do anything more about all tenants um questions about that thanks so i'm gonna count on my uh my mentor here to tell me if i'm not saying enough the second issue had to do with the phrase saying that the tenant has to i mean excuse me the owner this is in section one of the dash three on the first page section one sub one an owner shall give written notice of the owner's interest in selling the park before the owner markets the park for sale or when the owner receives an offer to purchase that the owner intends to consider and there was concern raised that the term market is not clear i think market is pretty clear i think most of us understand what it means to market a piece of real property i would note for you that we defined that concept in house bill 3007 which all the landlords opposed and one of the reasons they opposed because was because 3007 was way way way too complicated um so we took we took um you know we took ten lines of text to define what we meant about market there but the main point here is that the landlord controls this part of the process completely this only happens if a landlord decides he or she wants to sell if he or she does not want to sell there's no obligation to give a notice the notice obligation only arises when a landlord in his or her own discretion totally at his or her own discretion decides he or she wants to sell he's he or she is the person who's going to decide whether he or she is marketing the property and obviously if you've sold the property you without doing the notice unless you've got an exemption and there's we've specified exemptions in here uh if you sold the property you've gone without giving the notice you've gone too far but that's for the landlord to figure out the third uh issue that we talked about with representative was that about trying to clarify had to do with 1031 exchanges current law has some wording about that but it's not clear and we believe that uh the new version in cash 3 40 38 makes that clear so a 1031 tax free exchange and i am not a tax lawyer um but the point is that under federal income tax code if you sell real property and then buy like kind which basically means other real property within a certain period of time you are not taxed on the capital gains from the sale of your first property so how that plays into this dynamic with landlords is that sometimes landlords will have a buyer who will come to them and especially in the boom boom days before the recession say i got to buy some property really quick and i don't have anything else and my time's running out and i want to buy your property and because i'm in uh need to move quickly i'm going to pay you top dollar so what we've done here is make it clear that in those transactions the lender doesn't have to do any of this stuff the landlord has to follow the affidavit saying with the county saying i don't have to comply because i've done this um that's a procedure that exists in the current statute um but if the lender does that that buyer is safe that buyer is not at risk of the sale being set aside at all so that's sort of uh that up leg from the um the 1031 exchange buyer would exempt the landlord the owner from that transaction from having to do all this process the landlord going forward might also want to do a 1031 exchange after he or she sells the park by buying another piece of property too but in because the landlord in that point only controls the timing the timing and the issue the issue is just not there for them so we've tried to make it clear that the 1031 exchange if it's a buyer who has a 1031 exchange they're exempted from the process questions about those things i think not could i i do i was hoping to say a couple general things about the value but you're the chair and you tell me no value of the what we're doing here i don't talk about the substance of the bill i know you've heard plenty about the substance of the bill we have yes i want to know that this kind of tenancy is unusual you know in most cases and this is what i mostly do department tenants department tenants move all the time our tenants don't and there's uh they're a different kind of tenant they own their manufacturing home they rent the land but they own the manufactured home this arrangement is incredibly difficult but also incredibly valued valuable manufacturing parks are the largest source of affordable housing privately developed in the united states and in oregon that's that's significant it's a relationship that we need to foster we need to find a way to work together that's the point of the coalition is to work as partners to find ways for us to cooperate and make the law work for both parties and that's what we feel that we have done with this bill thank you okay nobody has a question okay great so mister yes thank you finally getting it thank you very much and i i want to start by thanking all the committee members very much for your time and patience and also representative wiz and real hats off to you for all the work you've put into this along with a hats off to representative nathanson for the great job she's done i want to thank john i want to thank chuck for your work on this as well we had a productive meeting on monday night improvements were made to the bill and i applauded that process as as being productive but unfortunately we felt the bill doesn't go far enough in terms of amendments and one of the the real conceptual hurdles that that i think we need to address is the idea of tenant organization ahead of time you can have situations in a mobile home park in fact they happen all the time where you have multiple factions of tenant groups multiple people profess to be the head of any number of tenant associations you could have one tenant association invoke the process and 25 days later the second association does it and on and on and on and the problem with the way this bill is framed is that it doesn't define that doesn't prevent that from happening uh it doesn't define a designated contact person with whom the park owner should deal with from the very first day of the process there are ambiguous terms and i unders i appreciate that legislative history helps that but terms that are vague and i've identified those for the committee already are a lawyer a lawyer's field day and that is something that i think we're trying not to do uh there was a memorandum that we i handed i gave to the committee members earlier uh from the oregon park owners alliance clarifying substantive amen and that substantive amendments and i would hope that all of you would take a moment to read it was just given to you before you make a decision on this bill today and as you can see there are quite a number of areas that need to be clarified and developed so i would ask you to do that i would also ask that you remember that before you vote on this bill this represents a sea change as to the way business is done now in terms of buying selling mobile home parks this is unprecedented it is a radical expansion of an existing right of first refusal for which there's never been a problem so that being said i would ask that you ask that you send this back to the work group that you not move it out of this committee that we work on it and and work toward consensus for the 2015 session i will say that in the all the years i've been doing this since the late 1990s every practically every bill that has come before a committee has been a consensus bill it's been one that we've worked on back and forth and this bill is not a consensus bill it does not have the the consensus of the oregon park owners alliance and there is a real philosophical divide in terms of how the process starts and the need for tenant organization at the front end that is our biggest concern here so i would ask that you not move this out of committee but you send us back to keep working on this and just look at the look at the work we we accomplished on monday night that was just one night and we've got four big concessions just think what we could do before 2015. we really could make this a much better more fair and evenly balanced bill so i thank you so much again thank you very much okay and tell us again how many park owners will i talk to representatives i'm going to revise the estimate i gave on monday and probably more between uh 40 and 60 park owners in terms of spaces i i couldn't tell you how many spaces and i haven't researched that all right but it's significant great thank you very much any questions representative gelsinger of a comment i i appreciate that this is a difficult issue which is why there's been so much work on it for so long and my hat is really off to representative wiznit and representative nathanson for all of the work they've put into this i do hope madam chair that we move the bill today this clearly has a tremendous amount of compromise in it i think the bill was ready to go on monday but i'm glad that the partners were willing to continue to work and clearly make some concessions and that's really the way that collaboration works and the best way to get invited into a work group and be part of a work group is to kind of accept those collaborations and compromises sometime and i think that's what happened ultimately a decision has to be made i think that we're there and i i hope we move today and i hope if we hear from this in the future that maybe that spirit of collaboration goes both ways and um there's good faith in the negotiations thank you representative we don't have what madam sure we don't have the fiscal right we don't have the fiscal yet so we can't go into a work session until we get the fiscal so i'm going to be closing the uh public hearing and we'll open that up mr gardner yes right okay so we will close the public hearing and we'll open up a work session when we get the fiscal year so thank you very much gentlemen and thank you representative nathanson and representative thank you very much good job madam chair we have just contacted the representative but you're a lot of regards if you have to call them up next okay in the next five minutes okay terrific so colleagues are going to open up the first public hearing on house bills 4028 and 40 40. madam chair and members of the committee house bill 4028 increases the amount of administrative services economic development fund dollars transfer problem gambling treatment fund from one to one point two percent requires 16.67 percent of problem gambling treatment fund to be expended to promote and advertise prevention and treatment of gambling addiction it's legislative finding that addicting persons to gambling is not consistent with the public good operative july 1 2014 declares emergency effective on passage there is a dash one amendment that replaces the measure it permits the oregon state lottery to use existing dollars allocated for the cost of administration and furtherance of state policy to minimize the risks and mitigate the harms of problem gambling house bill 4040. excuse me before i finish with house bill 4028 there is a minimal fiscal on the dash one and the revenue statement is pending depending on the revenue statement we have received advance permission to rescind the sexual or filter rate ways and means if the if it's all right with the revenue office that's been obtained house bill 4040 requires the oregon state lottery to balance their obligation to maximize net revenues with their obligation to serve the public good requires the lottery to adopt a comprehensive responsible gambling policy integrating consideration of responsible play into retail operations and marketing practices requires the lottery consult with stakeholders to develop the policy specifies the content of the policy requires an annual report to the appropriate legislative committees in cooperation with the oregon health authority that specifies the content of that report we have a dash two that's been received there's no substantive effect in that amendment it refers to terminals uh it describes computers gambling terminals in two different ways thank you apologize madam chair it has a minimal revenue and a minimal fiscal on the dash too great thank you thank you representative may and represent kenmore welcome to the committee thank you thank you so colleagues i'm this is representative carolyn today for the uh for your information i'm so pleased to be here today presenting house bills 4028 and house bill 4040 to this committee relating to the oregon lottery and gambling addictions representative kenmer and i and you as committee members have worked for years to get to this point and i want to thank all the advocates many who are here treatment providers the oregon health authority and especially the new administration of the oregon state lottery for working with us to make these significant improvements possible the new lottery director jack roberts who is here in the audience and the new commission chair lisa dizono have worked tirelessly to help us craft legislation that achieves our mutual goals and i also want to point out the representative kenny guyer also worked with us on the work group as did uh representative julie parish thank you for your work also you all know representative kennemur is a therapist and he's going to talk more about the impacts on our economy and the horrendous toll that gambling addiction has on families i'm just going to briefly outline according to our committee administrator some of the details of the bills house bill 4028 with the dash one amendment you have before you give specific statutory authority for the oregon state lottery to resume its activities to minimize risks of problem gambling and mitigate the harms it can advertise the availability of treatment programs support the hotline number collect data about vulnerable users and work collaboratively with the oregon health authority and other organizations to lessen the harmful impacts of problem gambling in our communities the previous lottery administration has discontinued these services and this bill gives legislative directives to reinstate the representative kinemer thank you for the record bill kenmore state representative district 39 thank you for your time and for letting us come before you again come to you supporting both of these bills um representative tomay i appreciate working with you and representative kenny guyer and actually all of us i think we all are very concerned about the welfare of oregonians and particularly as a therapist i'm very concerned about addictions um you're going to have a bill in a few minutes about another addiction as a matter of fact but gambling addiction not quite as widely discussed as alcoholism for example but the estimates are that somewhere between 70 and 80 000 oregonians that's a gigantic percentage are addicted to oregon lottery we're not talking reno we're talking oregon stuff so i think we have to be concerned about this it has a huge impact on the families and upon the people we also know that there are social justice issues involved unfortunately the majority of these addicts are going to be among the oregonians that can least afford it you know if you're filthy rich i think if you want to gamble away your money that's perhaps a choice you have but you know if you don't have much money and you you're spending it uh it's of great concern although i think we need to be careful and and we learned a lesson i think from prohibition years ago addictions uh can't be abolished by simply saying no uh we have to find a way to do this so what we've been doing in in making progress is uh the lottery has been cooperative in the past in creating some ads and supporting prevention however not too long ago we hit a hiccup and there was some concern about the funding of prevention so what this what house bill 4028 does is it clarifies that we're going to keep the status quo we don't want to raise hackles and create problems in a short session we want to maintain the status quo but we do want to keep that funding and instantly i would say it's very nice to have our new director in place i think mr roberts has been very cooperative and he wants to fund it that level so that's also helpful but i think it's good to make it statutory because we just realized that if we weren't careful hiccups can occur and we can lose that funding so uh i think it's important to put it in statute and i don't think that's very controversial to continue to do what we were doing i suspect that in coming sessions some of us will have some more ideas about some things that ought to be done but i think this one these two bills are actually very modest and and i think we need to realize that addicting people to gambling is not commensurate with public good and we need to be saying that in a very proper way and we need to do awareness everybody is aware of alcoholism not everybody thinks very much about gambling but the impacts are dramatic and with that i guess i would ask for your support for both bills and if you have any questions certainly we're available [Music] any questions well we've asked for your support so thank you so much please can i just comment again like i did with the other panel i've seen how hard you've worked on this and again how many years you've worked on this really want to thank you again like the previous camp panel not only for all your time but your bipartisan efforts yeah but i've really appreciated this it's been very good thank you thank you okay so we uh of those who have signed up to testify uh i'm going to call up jack roberts tim murphy and karen wheeler and then there's um another panel that i'll call afterwards that want to vote or testify on both [Music] so mr roberts if you want to go ahead and get started thank you for the record my name is jack roberts i'm the director of the oregon lottery and uh first thing i should explain the way it works in state government is that the executive branch is led by the governor the governor's office and they decide what bills we can take a position on which ones we cannot and they have authorized me to speak on behalf of and strong support of house bill 40 sorry 40 28. uh we've not taken the governor's office not taking position on 40 40. i'll just address briefly both of them but we are very very pleased that the legislature is taking the steps to clarify our authorization to spend lottery dollars in helping not only to advertise about responsible gambling which which everyone has agreed we can but there's been some legal questions raised about our ability to spend it on problem gambling and particularly ads that we ran trying to help encourage people to seek help and get get treatment we had one award-winning ad which showed in this case it was women speaking in a powder room about gambling and talking about someone that they knew and talking about that person one of them spoke up and said a year ago that could have been me and you know people were kind of surprised by that and she made this explanation how it was and then after everyone else left one of the people came back in and said can we talk that was a very effective way of explaining that this is not simply a problem for people who are um energetic or irresponsible it affects people at all it won an award but that's one of the ads that we've been advised we couldn't run because that was not really dealing with the operation of the lottery of dealing with treatment this gives us the ability and it recognizes that we do and it does that in two ways one by playing as part of our administration it does recognize that we have a responsibility we're going to have lottery and gambling in the state we all have a responsibility to make sure that we mitigate those adverse impacts on vulnerable people but the other thing it does for us frankly is it allows us to help in marketing our lottery to show people that they can play our games and participate and not feel guilty that they are supporting something that is that is creating problems without any sense of responsibility in dealing with it so it is like corporations understand the need to advertise their environmental sensitivities or their social values or the support they have for really caused to build up the integrity and support integrity of their organization we're the same way as a lottery we want to make sure that people understand we're living up to our responsibilities so we think it's important now in 40 40 as i said we're technically we're neutral about it but i will commend uh representative may she's worked with us she's basically including in there the steps that we are announcing we're taking we want to move forward and she's putting that in statute and we have no problem with that at the end there is a provision that's what the amendment you have talks about is it has a reporting requirement we just want to make sure that the information will require reports and stuff that is available to us and we have that and so uh i i think that's why when we looked at that we said that this is within our existing resources we're not asking for additional resources because these are things that we're committed to doing anyway thank you mr roberts i appreciate that karen any questions i should ask that before we move on okay okay go ahead good afternoon chair tommy members of the committee for the record my name is karen wheeler and i'm an administrator with the oregon health authority at the addictions mental health division and part of my responsibilities to administer problem gambling prevention and treatment services for the oregon health authority and we're here to testify in support of the one amendments to this bill which would authorize coordination cooperation between the lottery and the health authority as well as providers of problem gambling treatment and additional data collection activities as we understand it in the amendments and adoption implementation of rules to reduce problem gambling just to make a statement about the ads when we had ads rolling we did see spikes in the number of people who called the helpline we support a 24-hour problem gambling helpline we also saw spikes in the number of people who enrolled in treatment an effective ongoing incredible statewide promotional campaign is crucial for problem gambling treatment typically people who are addicted to substances alcohol drugs their referral pathways into treatment are much different than people who have problem gambling issues so most of the clients in addiction treatment for instance are referred by the criminal justice system they're referred by their health care practitioners wives husbands employers sometimes and it's much different for problem gamblers it's a very hidden addiction in fact nationally only one in 10 people actually seek treatment for problem gambling problem gambling is not on the radar screen as which was mentioned earlier for most people in oregon people just don't think about it there's a lack of awareness so that's another reason why we believe the ads are tremendously important to reinstate i think that's all of my substantive comments i do have some data if the committee is interested in sharing that later we have data that shows the trends and the number of people who called the helpline and who access treatment when the ads are actually running and i would just say a final statement we would be thrilled happy to coordinate and cooperate and work together with the oregon lottery thank you karen any questions thank you we've had that data before and here we've heard a lot of data how important this is so thank you um representative may members of the committee it's pleasure to be back here uh again talking with you about the problems of problem gambling it's the first time in my 10 years i've been able to sit here with the lottery commissioner with the oregon health authority and myself and we're all asking for you to support the same bill we've come a long way so i really appreciate that and i think it's a new direction for the oregon state lottery as well i'd also like to commend you madam chair and representative kendama for all the work that you've done i've been working with you for years now it has been really a commitment on your part that has made some of the changes and and made some of the opportunities for oregonians to receive treatment i'm here today as a i'm tim murphy i'm the chief executive officer of bridgeway recovery services here in salem we have the a large outpatient treatment program and the only residential treatment program in the northwest for people suffering from symptoms of problem gambling recently there was a series of articles in the oregonian that really outlined some significant issues that hopefully all of you read and took to heart and i will have opportunities throughout the year to talk more about those but one of the things this legislature did years ago was earmarked from the oregon state lottery for treatment and it's effective treatment and i'm here today not speaking so much for the treatment providers but for the thousands of oregonians that seek this treatment and need it it's great to have a broad treatment community available but if people don't know about it they can't access it and we've seen a definite decrease in requests for treatment even though we know the problem is increasing so i'm here to on behalf of all of those folks in treatment to ask your support along with the commissioner of lottery and the oregon health authority uh to approve the the funding for the the continuation of the advertising piece thank you thank you any questions thank you so much all of you okay yes i had a question mr roberts please yes mr arch thank you for testimony um i know this is something we all support but this is unusual we're putting an amount of money in a policy bill for your for your agency that is that for this buying two year period or is it for forever or we're actually not asking for any additional money we have this month we were prepared it was in our budget we had been spending it up until earlier last year when we got an opinion from the doj that said that our office requested at the time um and said we couldn't spend it for those things so we're just simply asking to have restored to us the authority to spend the money we already have and are planning to spend all that money but so it's still going to ways and means the ways that means could reduce that amount or not give you what back what you want or well whether it goes to ways and means is i guess your call initially i think the bill would have actually changed the appropriation of money that it was being allocated by the lottery two education and economic development and that and that he was to move that we're just supposed to be taking that out so yes it's the gut and stuff you have the the dash one right yes ma'am okay great so so this actually should not result in i don't think it should result in the referral the ways means because we're not changing the money we're just so freeing us up and allowing us to do what we were doing before one other question so also then you're taking out the amount of money does that get us out of the problem that south carolina's had with the with spending their money on them i guess i'm not familiar with south carolina's problem with that they may have had a similar issue that we did they questioned them spending money on certain things the purpose of this is to try to give the legislative authority for us to spend the money on that [Applause] nothing guarantees that someone won't bring some legal action against us although it's hard to imagine who would be suing us to get us to stop spending money dealing with problem gamblers uh not a legislator yeah but but i i think i i i think what we're trying to do is to flesh out what we believe the authority is already there that in deciding how to spend our administrative dollars and incidentally in the constitution we are limited our administrative costs can be above 16 percent and they're running three percent so we have some slack there to spend on administration we think this is an important part of administration and that's we're asking you to help us create the the legal basis to do what we have been doing and what we continue doing thank you thank you thank you very question thank you so much so next we will have jeff morata westwood and sharon williams [Music] [Music] welcome and you can start your testimony just to identify yourself and just start right now good afternoon i'm westwood [Music] i'm here with voices of problem gambling recovery we are a offshoot project of the oregon council on problem gambling six years in the making now we're now 501c3 to do the work we do i'm here as president our mission is to advocate educate and promote healthy recovery we provide statewide speakers bureaus outreach with care providers peer mentor certification and training placement work with government and the oregon lottery it's imperative especially now that action be taken to minimize the damage to our citizens our economy and their families each of these bills are part of that work it is key for the public to know their options and the availability of the treatment and care declining numbers in treatment do not represent a lesser problem quite the opposite i urge you through these bills to make part of a better future for oregonians i've attached to my handout a couple pages of comments that were returned to me after i spoke to student population at george fox college this year these were graduate students in psychology i attended an event with dr tom moore and we spoke directly to the life of problem gambling and i attached those so that you may have an opportunity at your leisure to read those and and maybe reflect on what that world really looks like and the chaos that comes with it [Music] on a small side note indulge me as i was gathering my notes nine years ago today i entered treatment so i did call my counselor and tell him thank you so it is life-saving work you know that's worth saying [Music] and the other thing i'll say to you is i travel statewide doing events speaking to care providers i speak to outreach groups whether it's er staff or whether it's a rotary or an elks club whatever that may be and what i can tell you in this last year around this hesitation in our commitment to getting the word out one of the perceptions that i see everywhere is people think treatment has gone away because the advertising has gone and that is a true tragedy at this point so thank you all so much for your hard work on this it's great thank you thank you congratulations on your recovery that's wonderful thank you i'm sharon williams um i am a member of voices of problem gambling recovery and also i'm on the council of oregon council on problem gambling um personally um i am a recovering gambling addict um i gambled for many years while my while my children were small i destroyed every area of my life when i was gambling when i quit gambling um i went to a psychiatric ward because i had a suicide attempt and they didn't know what to do with me because they knew about alcohol and drugs and they knew about mental health and depression and all that stuff but they they actually told me that i didn't need to go to uh the groups because i'm a gambler so it didn't apply to me so um eventually i did beco come involved in a recovery program and i'm still involved with that and over the years i have just developed uh really a passion for doing this work to help people who have a gambling problem um you know i still see people come in to the meetings i go to whether that's a 12-step meeting or a voices meeting or hands across the bridge or whatever it is we're doing and they're just they're blinded you know they have that glassy look of they don't know what to do and they don't they think they're the worst person in the world and nobody else is like them so you know i like to be there for those people and i i have so much appreciated that oregon has had an excellent um gambling problem gambling uh recovery treatment programs and um and and i've actually been fortunate enough to be able to work in that field as well i'm mostly retired now so pretty much everything i do like talking is um is voluntary but i think it's so so important to keep these services going and to maintain constant visibility for our programs in this state because the gamblers that that need to help they're only going to see this when they're ready so it can't just be you know twice a year or three times a year that these messages are sent out it needs to be somewhat uh you know some something on a repeated nature so um i support both of these bills and i hope that you guys pass these thank you thank you very much i appreciate coming to testify today and i think you make a really good point we talking about these messages coming on continually and it's a hidden addiction it seems you know you can see when somebody is often you can see somebody's high on drugs or high on alcohol but family addiction is a hidden addiction and so it's important to see these ads on television and other media so people realize it's not just me i don't know anybody else who's addicted to gambling it's not just me there is there there is treatment out there so thank you for bringing that up sir you're welcome hello jeff hello i'm chair timmy members of the committee my name is jeff morata uh i am the owner and a senior consultant confirmed i began problem gambling solutions i've been involved in problem gambling for my entire professional career i was the problem killing services manager over with oregon department human services being in 2000 or 2007. since then i went out and began this consulting business and developed a specialization in responsible gaming and have worked with the oregon lottery up until very recently since my departure from state government so i have a 13-year relationship uh with with the oregon lottery and i've seen the coming and going five different directors and i've seen uh different uh levels of commitment and efforts placed on responsible gambling practices and due to this uh this waxing and waning that has occurred over these the 13 years that i've beared witness to the to these efforts i can tell you um it's very gratifying to see that some of the what what is kind of moving forward now with the responsible gambling policy that the oregon lottery has um has adopted that that will be codified and that will provide some assurances that we will no longer have this waxing awaining that has taken place over the past 13 years so that is a tremendous and very important step forward i would like to very much express my appreciation toward uh sam to man and the committee for their hard work on this and i've been involved in some of it and it's very gratifying to be here at this stage where we can receive the type of consensus that we have in support of these bills and you have my written testimony from you so i'm not going to read it for you but i will say that uh these bills are incredibly important one of the other things that these bills do that is vital is it directly links the oregon lotteries principles of integrity security honesty and fairness with the provision of gambling services in a way that seeks to minimize harm to consumers and the community associated with gambling that that is very important to basically help everybody better understand what can measure it with the public good means so these these bills go such a long way in bringing us closer i think to a healthier organ one that will see fewer gambling related problems and a lottery that will i think become a pinnacle of operation of social responsibility so thank you very much thank you jeff any quick questions of the panel thank you very much we the last person we have signed up is jonathan eames you're here there he is oh no yes yes that's hi it thank you madam chair members of the committee for the record my name is jonathan eames i'm here on behalf of cascadia behavior healthcare and the organ prevention education and recovery association and since i'm the only one left i only have a short 45 minute testimony [Music] for all the great things that have been said prior to my this testimony we have seen at cascade in parquet here and actually you also have some testimony there from philip yasunov who is the um the director of our gambling services and cascadia one of the larger providers of gambling treatment services in the state of oregon actually in the united states as well but we have seen a precipitous drop in the number of people that have actually called in and actually tried to get uh gambling service or treatment services since the advertising has gone away so we have on the ground real experience and identifiable data to show that actually the great you know the terrible thing is the advertising went away the good thing is that we know it was working so kudos to the lottery for that uh but um but we really do need to make this fix it's something that's very important and we really do as as representative kenderman said keep the status quo going so i won't i won't belabor the point this is very good i think these these are very good things to do anything we can do to support and and fund and invest more in gambling treatment it's a good thing thank you very much thank you jonathan i need a quick question all right thank you so much um question show yeah make a comment though i just want to thank the chair and representative kenny moore i mean i i can't imagine the suffering that this this addiction brings to people into their families and so i think the change is really this feels really important thank you thank you thank you representative thank you again represent kenny and thanks to represent kenmore i imagine he's gone by now i think we don't have the materials do we have enough to pass madam chair members of the committee 4040 is ready on the dash 2. it's 40 28 i would like to clarify we're trying to keep up with the pace of the committees the uh subsequent referral on that measure still exists on all of the databases that the revenue office is referring to the verbal authorization the letter of permission from the speaker's office is received depending on the the statement that's the statements that issue so the revenue impact you see at the diocese that recently issued doesn't account for the fact that we have permission to rescind the subsequent referral i want to make sure that that was clear was part of the confusion for perhaps so that is the measure that's not ready 4040 is ready on the dash 2. 40 28 he's not ready on the dash one okay so we're going to vote on 40 40 40 40. okay okay so we've already opened the work session right we're in a public hearing and work session and work session okay so amount chair yes okay i moved to adopt the dash two amendments dated five twenty fourteen into house bill 40 40. representative what is his name olson moved to adopt the desk to amendment david 2 5 14 and with the dash two amendments data two five fourteen any discussion question i'm sure yes uh question for mrs ross the i'm sorry i haven't read the bill but so we're gonna rescind with a letter from the speaker the subsequent referral weighs and means on 40 28. so why wouldn't 4040 have a referral too because we're talking about money being here isn't it we we aren't yet on the verge of rescinding the subsequent referral on 4028 that would happen with the committee it's inclined to 2040 we're only adopting the amendments that's the active motion 4040 that is within the sound discretion of the speaker's office referrals i don't have an answer there's a change in mission but nothing financial correct that's why 4040 doesn't happen one that says that because the dash one is for 40 28. there's no there's a dash two on 40 40. the statement it has on 4040 requires oregon state lottery commission to balance its obligation to maximize net revenues for the obligation to serve public good is that that's a mission statement and was just changing the statement and so it's saying obligate to maximizing that revenue that's what i was bringing up about the south carolina situation where they were sued the state was [Music] because they were using lottery money to treat can i we do allow lottery money for treatment remember we've put a floor on it in 2013. we put so we could not use any less money than that chairman yes sure having worked on that committee and we spent a lot of time talking about the mission statement and was it clear enough and the way we were interpreting the mission statement about commencement with the public good was the public good is not just the budgeting benefit that comes from lottery dollars but the public good also means um the overall public health uh of the state and that then that carries the spirit with it that you have to balance uh collecting dollars with making sure that you're not getting dollars in a way that harms people but we felt that that definition didn't um wasn't clear enough and so this is really a mission a clarity of the mission statement to say that that's what the that's what the balance has to be but it's not a direct fiscal impact the legislation in front of you all you have is the the staff summary do you have the bill here i haven't i have it for you i'll go manager go ahead we'll just move it and evolve okay terrific okay so we have a motion any other questions this is 40 40 that we're moving we should talk about the mnus yes and or movies adopting amendments both amendments amendments one and two you only have the one set of amendments okay any objection to moving the dash to amendment say none nobody would go okay you accepted that okay so we've accepted the amendment okay ma'am sure i moved house bill 4040 as amended to the floor with the duke pass recommendation represent olsen moves uh house bill 4040 as amended to the florida do pass recommendation any discussion thank you madam chair first of all i must always say how impressed i am with your commitment to this issue and your compassion for the people that such as we heard from today whose lives have been ravaged by this i have to say that i am very encouraged by the governor's selection of a new director i think we've got a man of complete integrity here's the but i don't know why we continue to look at the lottery for our solution despite the fact that the statute has language saying that they must for the public good spend time on addiction prevention despite their mission i think we continue to focus on the wrong bureaucracy the wrong department and i have very little faith in their ability over the long term because of the nature of what they do to be effective at what we're trying to do and i think we ought to be asking the question should we abolish the lottery because it's the state of oregon and with that with great respect i will be a no thank you representative and the other comments or questions saying none uh the clerk will call the role please right do the right thing right okay call the rule right are we adopting the amendment now we're moving forward sending forward the due pass recommendation will call the goal please representative gallego all right representative gelser aye representative gilliam no representative kenny dyer aye representative aye i'm sure i'm going to vote no but i may change my mind on the floor i'd like to check this out okay representative with that excuse vice chair domberg all right right chair open aye here's home hi with that the motion passes thank you committee it's a long time coming i will be the carrier okay so now i've got to close house bill 40 48 right or do i just carry it to the end of today's meeting we'll be closing the public hearing on 40 40 and suspending the work session in case we get the doctor you're talking about 40 48 right 40 49 at least over here we just passed it from closing the excuse me 40 20 yes that's correct now 40 48 okay so i'm closing the public hearing and the work session on 40 40 right to only 40 40 correct all right and uh but i'm holding open the work session on 40 20 28. okay got it okay because we're hoping we get that information before the end of the day thank you um with that we will open up thank you the um uh the hearing and a possible work session on 40 73 and 41 15. so do you want to give us the measure yes members of the committee hospital 4073 and house bill 4114 touch on the same subject matter house bill 4073 expands the applicability of laws governing miners access to possession and use of tobacco products to include vapor products hospital 4115 expands the applicability of laws governing miners access to possession and use of tobacco products to include vapor products it also extends the applicability of laws governing adult use of tobacco products in public places to include vapor products meaning uh oregon clean indoor air act public meetings places of employment hospitals expands to prohibition against smoking and motor vehicles with a child present to include vaping declares an emergency and is effective on passage great thank you very much uh representative olsen and is representative barnhart here yes yes oh grace thank you representative will you come up and talk about your bill welcome to our committee representative uh thank you madam chair my name is phil barnhart i'm the state representative from house district 11. and i thought we were going to have uh ledge council come and explain some of the differences and he's right there why don't we have and it would be wonderful if you could do that before i give my test sure that would be great [Music] uh charitome representative uh olsen uh vice chair gomberg excuse me if my voice is a little uh cracking i got a little bit of a sore throat today so thank you um so i was asked to come down and briefly describe the drafting process for the bills as well as the distinct differences between the two because they are very similar and because of certain issues that have arise since the drafting state your name for the record please uh excuse me the name for the record is mark mayer from alleged counsel thank you so both bills do two things with respect to vapor products as well as statutes that currently prohibit the use and consumption of tobacco products by minors they both define vapor product the definitions are very similar i'll go over that in just a minute and they both update statutes related to the consumption and exposure of tobacco products by miners so that those statutes equally apply to vapor products house bill 4115 also as the summary was just read updates those statutes related to the use of tobacco products in public places so they also equally apply to vapor products and that would be the major distinction between the two it was mentioned that i should just or it was requested that i should mention that in preparing the bills i did look at every statute that contains the terms tobacco product tobacco cigarette and smoking in order to ensure that we would update all the appropriate statutes statutes that were not added to the bill and not amended into the bill were either unrelated to the subject matter and in some cases they were they involved programs that involved the uh that involved federal monies and we didn't want to amend those statutes for obvious reasons didn't want to jeopardize any kind of funding mechanism [Music] and finally it was requested that i mentioned that none of the statutes are amended in any way except for the fact that they add vapor products so that the statute equally applies there are no other substantive changes in these bills as you can see if you just read through it and then finally it was requested that i go through the definition for vapor product i think as most people here know if the court needs to discern legislative intent it's going to use the pge and state versus gains rubric in order to look at legislative intent under that methodology the court is going to look at the plain meaning of the text and the context of the statute first and then it will look at the legislative record [Music] plain meaning will be discerned by looking to the dictionary in order to discern what the legislature meant when it incorporated certain words into the text of a statute so the first in both bills vapor product has two meaning meanings first vapor product is an electronic device designed to heat nicotine solutions and other solutions for the purpose of producing a vapor to be inhaled by the user of the device second a vapor product is a nicotine solution in any form designed to be used with such a device there's an important caveat there involving a dash one amendment which i'll discuss at the very end of my testimony so if you look at the dictionary you look at the components of the definition design means to have as a purpose or to or to devise for a specific function or end solution means a homogeneous mixture not necessarily liquid vapor means diffused matter and so if you kind of string these different definitions together you could come up with vapor product is an electronic device that has as its purpose the heating of homogeneous mixtures including homogeneous nicotine mixtures for the purpose of producing diffused matter to be inhaled thank you representative olsen and then for the second piece of the definition for both bills a vapor product is also the nicotine solution itself that you use with the device now the dash one amendments to house bill 4115 they remove the nicotine components of that definition so it would a vapor product would then be any solution that you use with the device that was an important distinction that representative barnhart wanted me to make about the dash ones [Music] is there anything else chair tell me any questions of ledge counsel thank you so much for coming would you stay in the audience please in case other questions you come up can you do that yeah i appreciate that thank you very much is that exactly yes thank you madam chair and i appreciate the uh the distinction because i think it's important for the committee to understand uh this distinction between the two bills and i will say that we have been working hard trying to write a bill that is simple in its effect even though it gets fairly complex in the drafting because of the way in which our tobacco laws are scattered uh throughout through the statutes and so really what this bill does is it catches up to the technology that's already uh in place in our society it doesn't break any new ground it simply applies the rules we already have to smoking to these new products that other people have told me are not covered by our existing statute even though the many of the effects are the same now the key difference i think between these these two bills is that while both bills restrict the sale to miners actually prohibit the sale to miners the the 40 uh 4115 also prohibits the use of these devices and the solutions that you that you heat in them in places where smoking is not permitted now so it's easy to apply uh public health officials have told us that one of the biggest benefits of this bill is uh the addition to the clean air act because it would reduce the behavior of modeling to young adults very young and and children when we i think everyone in this room agrees that we should not encourage or provide for smoking or the use of these products by adolescents and the young adults to the extent that we possibly can manage that because of the addictive nature of the substances because we're dealing with growing brains because we're dealing with growing bodies and they these uh young people are particularly susceptible to the uh to the uh addiction process that takes place the other things that we know about the addictive addictive process is that it isn't simply the a prohibition that works what works are a whole constellation of things one of which is the the lack of an of a normative uh situation that allows people to see the use of these products in normal situations uh and and which therefore would encourage them to think this is cool this is wonderful this is something i'll get involved in the reality is that anyone who wants cigarettes can find them even despite the fact that it's illegal for young people to get them or use them anyone young people if they want them can find e-cigarettes the task for the legislature and the task for our society as a whole is to prevent the addictive process by doing a whole bunch of other things one of which is covered particularly by this bill 4115 data analyzed by the center for disease control and prevention show that the number of adult americans who have used e-cigarettes has quadrupled from 2009 to 2010 it also showed that from the national youth tobacco survey that e-cigarette use doubled among middle and high school students in two thousand eleven two thousand twelve uh nicotine harm reduction should also be questioned as these e-cigarettes perpetuate the use of nicotine by allowing users and tobacco smokers to get from one cigarette to the next when tobacco users might otherwise quit you use cigarettes in the morning at work you use e-cigarettes at the restaurant you use e-cigarettes that they hold at the waiting room at the airport you use e-cigarettes and then you can get back to your regular smoke once you get home at night and so we're perpetuating uh the use of these these devices additionally false claims of safety have enticed those who have already quit to start again i had a conversation just last week with somebody who told me that they used to smoke cigarettes that they had stopped and had not used nicotine at all for a time and then began using it again uh believing that e-cigarettes were safe the health impacts of these devices represent i just want to clarify you're saying that that person started using e-cigarettes and yes after having stopped using regular cigarettes for a period of time um and so these these are beguiling uh devices that uh that we do not want to encourage as a matter of public policy uh and i think the other the other obvious end point has to do with the health impact not just on the person who's using them but also on everybody else in the area the reason why we have the oregon indoor clean air act is to protect uh third parties people are second parties i guess people who are not using uh these materials from being exposed to them directly people at work people in classrooms who are there to study people in the airport waiting room waiting to get on an airplane and have to be there because that's where they have to be in order to get on the airplane and on and on and on these devices have chemicals that can negatively affect our quality for non-users imagine yourself in one of these places that i mentioned people believe that e-cigarettes are safe alternative to smoking partly because the advertising that's been done by uh tobacco companies and others although the food and drug administration has warned that e-cigarettes contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze close quote the nicotine effects i think are pretty obvious and i could go into those in in detail but i'll simply say that the december 19 2013 just a couple of months ago a study from roswell park one of the one of the uh respected cancer one of the most respected cancer institutes in the world talks about the nicotine effects on blood pressure heart rate vasoconstriction of blood vessel damage stress adverse effects on the brain and lung development in children the effect on pregnant women with the increased risk of babies born with birth defects and on and on and on some of these at least can be mitigated for people who do not use these products directly by restricting them by restricting the use to areas other than the ones that we regularly post as non-smoking you're going to hear some things about how you'll probably hear some things today about how these products can be used in tobacco harm reduction i urge very clear caution as you look listen to this testimony and as you look at it no e-cigarette has been approved by the fda for therapeutic use if companies wanted to submit them for evaluation for therapeutic use they could but today not one e-cigarette company has chosen to go through the steps to be regulated as a tobacco cessation product in 2009 the oregon attorney general successfully sued two companies sotera and smoking everywhere notice the name because they were marketing their products as safe in general and safer than conventional cigarettes but neither of these businesses was able to show was able to substantiate their claims in fact there was no indication that these were not harmful that they did not have harmful carcinogenic agreements they were free of tar and other chemical substances that are produced in traditional cigarettes lab testing by the fda found that tobacco-specific nitrosamines which are known carcinogens in humans were found they also tested for ethylene glycol ingredient used in antifreeze as i mentioned earlier known to be highly toxic to humans and they found these substances the stipulated judgment that the attorney general uh was able to obtain announcement remember stipulated judgment means that the company agreed to it with smoking everywhere included in express admission by the company that they'd violated oregon's unlawful trade practices act and they paid ninety five thousand dollars to the department my suspicion is to pay for the departmental costs and prosecuting them um uh smoking everywhere and sotera were permanently borrowed from doing business in the in the state as a result of these claims i would also note that there's very strong support around the state benton county classic county deschutes county hood river county and umatilla county have already passed smoke-free policies that explicitly include e-cigarettes from the standpoint of of uniformity it's important to also ban the use of these devices for other substances in the first place we know that it's very easy to mix any number of flavorings one of the companies we interviewed that indicate they have 300 different products which contain all kinds of different scents or flavorings and any of them can be mixed with nicotine to to whatever level that you would like so the only way you can actually control uh these devices in non-smoking areas is not only to ban the nicotine substance but also any other substance so in effect what you're doing is banning the use of the device in a non-smoking area also do for the same reason the sale to miners need to include the the devices and all of the different things that are designed to be used to burn in those products some of them are in cartridges some of them come in a little bottle with a with a stopper and a uh and an eyedropper to place on the on the burning element in the in the device there they come in a variety of different ways i suggest that the definition we have chosen here is designed not only to apply to the the e-cigarettes that are available today but also the ones that are likely to be developed in the future as tobacco companies and others engage us in an arms race to get around our rules it's very important to understand that their business model demands they won't say this but it's clear their business model demands that they are able to addict a certain percentage to victimize a certain percentage of our young people every year in order to stay in business long term people who don't start using these products until their age 22 or 23 never become addicts or almost almost never become addicts it's important for them to work on the younger people if we allow the use of these devices in non-smoking areas not only do we expose everyone else as a victim to these devices but we also make it normative for kids to do that now i want to say one of the things this bill does not do i've heard around the room the building and so have you about people who have been smoking all their lives and all of a sudden they've discovered these devices and then now they're starting to use them instead and anecdotally they'll tell you that they feel better and they don't cough as much and those kinds of things i'll point out that the studies that have been done in this area are purely anecdotal at this point we don't have any good studies that demonstrate this actually actually leads to health improvement and of course they're still addicted to nicotine but this bill does not restrict them from using e-cigarettes it doesn't restrict the sale of e-cigarettes or the chemical or the material that goes in them to adults adults can still do that if you are a chain smoker and you want to reduce your smoke your the the uh the other materials that go into your lungs and you want to try using e-cigarettes to do that you can do that i will point out to those who are sitting behind me who may be tempted to do that there's no evidence that we know now that suggest this actually helps people to stop using nicotine but if you wanted to do it this bill doesn't prevent you from doing that all it does is that the people who cannot smoke now in no smoking areas would also not be allowed to use these devices in those smoking areas madam chair members of the committee i urge you to adopt this this bill and sent and send it on to the floor and then to the senate this bill has an emergency clause the numbers of of uh shops that sell these materials there were there were six shops in before 2009 and now there are 87 [Music] that sell that sell primarily these kinds of of devices and the substance making mixing the substances that go in them seven shops were registered with the secretary of state last month in january it is important to get this done now to get it done quickly every month we wait adds to the number of young addicts young victims of of these substances every month we wait so it's important to get it done now thank you madam charlotte thank you thank you i'm ready to answer any questions any quick questions we need to move on because we have a lot of people who signed up to testify any quick questions okay we may i think we won't be passing any legislation today baby but if we need to we'll be calling you back representatives thank you i appreciate that very much [Music] can people stay after we're supposed to go until 4 45 can you stay until five i think no i really don't want you everybody but representatives um but if you could that would be great because a lot of people have traveled a long ways to be here and we haven't heard anything more about the manufactured home madam chair members of the committee hospital 4038 is still no okay but okay uh house bill 4028 in the meantime has received an indeterminate fiscal so it's ready anytime for a worker okay great thank you thank you madam chair and committee members my name is andy olsen and i'm state representative from the albany area i do want to talk to you about house bill 4073 which is electronic cigarettes to minors bill um i'm going to kind of just briefly go through the testimony i have that you have in front of you here but many of you know that last year the state of washington along with 12 other states passed the legislation that dealt with electronic cigarettes being known as e-cigarettes to miners and what this bill here 4073 does and would join 28 other states basically would just prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes to miners that's that's how simple this is i do i have some uh individuals who are behind me that are i would love to have share with you a little bit some examples of what the machine itself is justin newman i think and some others might be coming up but also there are some others too since uh represent barnhart he alluded to the issue about no evidence for what the impact of changing from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes creates for health there are some members that are here that will tell you personal life stories what it has done for them now what what are e-cigarettes e-cigarettes are a battery battery operated product designed to deliver nicotine to user by heating liquid nicotine derived from tobacco plants along with flavors and other chemicals into a vapor that the user inhales as reported by the u.s surgeon general and u.s department of health and human services the nicotine found in e-cigarettes is highly addictive has immediate biochemical effects on the brain and body at any dosage and is toxic to the high doses so i mean if you kind of get why it's kind of important to move forward to want to prohibit this you should also know that of the individuals that are retailers around the state that i have had conversation with regarding this celsius they have already created a personal policy of their own not to sell to minors so you know and i really appreciate that effort from them and and their consideration for that they'll be coming here and they'll be supporting what this bill is all about so yeah you can read the rest of what i have there i think my bill 4073 is fairly simple and it's one of those things that we need to move on quickly with it does create a violation i mean it moves it into the portion of the statute which is on this third page that deals with violations and for endangering the welfare of a minor it makes a classy violation all right thank you questions yes represented thank you madam chair uh representative olson thank you for your testimony today and i apologize for not getting you this question in advance but i think you have a unique perspective on this one particular subject area we recently passed legislation that prohibits people from smoking in cars with children present and with your police background i'm wondering if you might be able to comment on how an officer might be able to tell the difference between currently illegal smoking in vehicles versus currently legal smoking of electronic cigarettes that appear the same that's really that's a great question ma'am chair and representative gomberg great question uh for one thing the folks that are going to be coming up and testifying for me and the example the there are no studies about the impact of what the vapor or just that small moment of what that creates versus that of secondary hand smoke you know it does uh and which you can easily detect inside a motor vehicle in that compressed compartment um i mean i i've had the opportunity to witness and experience the vapor itself it doesn't stay long so i'm a crucial piece is you're going to have to determine whether or not in fact you know that did occur and then here's the other thing you're going to have to consider was there any nicotine in the the substance itself because a lot of people are not using nicotine as they purchase them you're going to hear that excuse me man of chair sheriff i can just restate my question because i just want to make sure they represent understand a police officer from a reasonable distance can they tell the difference when they're observing a vehicle go by no no that's that's really difficult see you're going to have to be you know basically in a situation like that you're going to almost have to be side by side traveling down a multiple lane road to see that thank you any other questions thank you representative olson we have a lot of people and um who are signed up to testify um [Music] several people are supportive of representative olson's bill i don't think anybody has testified or is interested in testifying against it we have several people who are more than 100 miles away and i would remind you that that would be maybe roseburg i mean eugene would only be 50 miles south and so we're talking probably about roseburg somebody can help me and so our state of policy is to invite people to come up who are 100 miles or more away because we'll hear as many people as we can and i will stay here and probably representative olsen as long as it takes to have make sure everybody who is here to sign up will have a chance to testify venture if if i may uh one of the first people i think uh folks justin north newman would be a really good one to have a first he's from eugene even though i realize that's not within 100 miles but he can really give you a great perspective and i think a lot of the others that are supportive of this would you know be able to tag in on that okay so we i'd be glad to have justin come up here and so i want to make sure there's sarah hartsteit artstein and sarah where are you where are you from corvallis i don't think corvallis is 100 miles away is it representative no okay um let's see tim churchill medford certainly you come on up tim um dalton varstad yesterday and where are you from that's not a hundred miles sorry taylor jones that's not 100 okay all right so we'll put you in line with other people we have justin newman um travis mcdonald what where washington state doesn't count no you're able to be in line with other people sorry okay so there was somebody who lived 100 medford medford [Music] louisiana yes okay we will come on up their features okay all right so i'm going to ask you to make your testimony short we have about 25 minutes or less so if you can make your testimony short that would be great go ahead my name is justin newman i'm the vice president of sales and distribution for a eugene and springfield-based company called emerald vapors we sell vaporizer type products and solutions with and without nicotine i'm here today to support house bill 4073 on andy olson's side okay we're sorry representative olsen side to ban themselves liquids and vaporizers to to children to those under the age of 18. okay all right uh we believe the other bills go too far there's just not enough evidence to support their implementation and uh believe that more time is needed for that research so [Music] we've also taken a proactive i wanted to point this out we've taken a proactive approach to the underage vaping [Music] by posting exterior signs as well as interior signs implementing uh card verification in our stores and um and educating public so we do believe it should be an adult decision and not available for children [Music] and if you have written materials you're welcome to give it to staff and and we'll make sure it gets to everybody it looks like you have some written materials you know i do it's uh it has quite a few notes well i'm gonna i don't know if you can read my people here if you could just briefly summarize what your your salient points are that would be great okay basically we're here to to help implement a policy that that we've already proactively implemented ourselves and we think that representative olson's bill does a good job of that [Music] but the other bills go too far and i don't think i can say it any better than that so that's great thank you for doing that thank you go ahead madam chair and we need your name please okay madam chair and members of the committee um thank you for listening to us today um i would like to give you your name sorry my name is tim churchill i'm from medford and i'd like to applaud mr olsen or chair member olsen on the 40-73 to keep that away from miners i work for ec blend company who is a manufacturer of the e-liquids and we have over we employ over 120 people there in medford [Music] this is a very fast growing industry and it you guys have a lot of work ahead of you i'm sure on deciding the right path to take we support your focus on the welfare of the general public and for minors however we oppose the the major 4115 because it does restrict a lot of the retail stores from from offering the product the customer has to be able to try this product it's an item specific stores most of the vape shops it's not if you want to go and learn about vaping or try the products you really need to test them and this would have a negative economic effect on sales as at least 75 percent of those sales would come from the trials of the product um we would like to be defined as an exemption in this legislation if at all possible and we feel that there would be no excess exposure to the general public from vaping in the stores you you want to do you understand what he's saying about an exception i do not could you from this from the standalone stores in in the bill 4115 they were talking about um not restricting vaping in the stores okay unless it was a standalone store okay that that seems to be the current law regarding cigarettes so yeah tobacco great okay thank you very much madam chair committee thank you for the opportunity to testify for the record i am dr joel nitzken i am a public health physician from new orleans louisiana i've been active in tobacco control since the 1980s and since 2007 very active in the arena of tobacco harm reduction after that e-cigarettes most of the work i have done in this area i've done on behalf of the american association of public health physicians but lacking the financial resources to travel to try to address these issues i've had to seek additional outside support to make such testimony possible and for that purpose i've established a relationship with the r street institute and what is that the r street institute is a washington dc libertarian think tank that is dedicated to free market solutions to problems they are moderate in their views they fully respect the role of government in regulating industry to protect health and protect the environment but they're very concerned about cases and instances where the governmental agencies go well beyond the regulations needed to protect the the health of the public and in their mind the e-cigarette issue appears to be one of those issues and for that reason they're supporting the work that i do and others in the public health community that share these views very briefly uh i've prepared two handouts which should already have been distributed to the committee one with my testimony today and the second in our street paper making the case for tobacco harm reduction very briefly we fully support bill 4073 restricting sales to miners because nicotine per se can be harmful to the adolescent brain and should be restricted not only do we encourage support of that bill we would urge the legislature to up the age cut off from 18 to 21 because this tendency to propensity to addiction probably lasts until age 25 or 26 and we can get a much bigger portion of it and get this out of the high schools by upping the age to age 21. with regard to the prohibition of e-cigarettes and no smoking areas we think that that would be a damaging step to take from a public health perspective and let me under explain why first of all the studies have been completed e-cigarette vapor as expailed by the user [Music] does not contain any toxic chemical substances that are detectable above background levels in indoor environments no they are not it's not pure water vapor there aren't trace quantities of carcinogens there but the quantities are exceedingly low the reason for the sum up i'm going to ask you to sum up your testimony i know we have printed materials and we will look through that but we have a lot of people here who are wanting to testify let me tell you why i'm here and why i've dedicated my energy to this the government the federal agencies talk about 480 000 deaths a year due to tobacco products in the united states all of those deaths are due to a single product the combustible cigarette there are not enough deaths from all other tobacco products combined for the federal agencies to track since 2004 the numbers of smokers in the united states and the numbers of deaths by the best cdc estimates have been stable tobacco harm reduction which means simply informing smokers that they could reduce their risk a potentially fatal cancer heart and lung disease by 98 or better is the only feasible policy option we have for reducing the number of smokers in the united states and reducing those deaths 4115 is basically intended to communicate the idea that the e-cigarettes are as harmful as cigarettes because in the tobacco control world the mantra has always been a tobacco-free society dr nixon i'm going to give you 30 seconds okay if they would simply change that mantra to a smoke-free society they would be in line with the best of science i would welcome the opportunity to meet with those who are supportive of 4115 urge them to review the material and my handouts thank you dr thank you thank you very much we're suspending this just for a minute because we're doing a work session on hospital uh 434038 not on a chair members of the committee house bill 438 which was carried over from monday we have received a uh no fiscal impact statement so there's no uh revenue impact no fiscal impact on the dashboard amendment and the committee would be able to uh send it to move forward thank you great that's correct thank you madam chair okay okay yes i moved adopt the dash three amendments to house bill 4038 representative olson

work session no displays madam chair members of the committee house bill 4028 is also ready for selling climb that measure was waiting for a revenue statement one has come in as indeterminate on the dash one and so it doesn't need to go towards the means right that's correct we have permission not to send it there i'm going to open up the work session and hospital 4028 representative okay ma'am sure i move to adopt the dash 1 amendments to house bill 4028 representative olson moves to adopt the dash 1 amendment stated 2 4 14 any discussion any objection so yeah i'm sure i move house bill 4028 as amended to the floor with the do pass recommendation and that as a subsequent referral to the committee on ways and means be defended to be rescinded representative olson moves house bill 4028 as amendment as amended to the floor um with the due pass recommendation and that the subsequent referral to the committee on ways and means be rescinded any discussion any objection uh oh no we've got to call that rule representative aye representative gelter aye [Music] excused vice chair gomberg hi this bill passes thank you so much committee can we rebuild it great good all right now we'll we open up the hearing on house bills 4073 and 4015. oh representative uh kenmore and i will carry that bill together thank you okay so now we're going back um actually i'm gonna call called everybody who lived more than 100 miles away right so i'm going to call up bill cross and um oh he's left but he will be back i think no um bill cross has a statement we'll we'll call him at a later time so um we're going to hear from karen gerard karen you guys are excused thank you so much yes oh i see okay so we have timothy schultz travis brisbane sean bowers and uh next we'll have those three people here please next we will have sam is that right yes ma'am okay um in the hot city [Music] very quickly so everybody will have a chance to speak i'd appreciate it and state your name please thank you madam chair my name is timothy schultz um i'm here as a couple of hats first off i'm i'm a user of tobacco electronic cigarettes i was a smoker for 25 years for the last five or ten of that pack and a half to two packs a day um over a year ago i quit smoking due to using vaping products i have noticed my health improved significantly as a result of that did so i know some of the science is up for question um but i know what it's done for me [Music] i don't hack i don't wheeze i smell better i taste better and all it totally enriched my life and i would i know i'd have family members that have died as a result of tobacco that would be alive today if these products were available back then um i'm also here as a hat as a shop manager i manage a shop in portland that sells these products i can tell you that i think the emergency measure is a little extreme every shop that i know of in this state already restricts the sales of these products to anyone who's an adult i know in my shop and every shop in portland we card on entry we absolutely will not sell to any miners we don't encourage that at all um i also feel that some of the the wording in 4115 um if it were to be enacted i i'm against it but i also feel some of the wording on restricting shops or sampling in shops except ones that are tobacco certified right now there aren't any shops that would even qualify under that certification mainly because of their standalone building um and to enact that and then save at the tobacco shops or allow the sample where somebody is going to then be forced to be in that tobacco environment when they're trying to save themselves from being around tobacco is totally unfair okay thank you very much for coming to testify i appreciate that [Music] my name is sean bowers thank you madam chair and committee i am a i'm a vaping product user i've used uh i've used e-cigarettes over the last couple of years but i found a great deal of uh difficulty in successfully switching to to the e-cigarette and away from the cigarette until i was able to until i realized that there were such things as stores that offered sampling and a in an environment that was welcoming to to the use of e-cigarettes and vaporizers um i was stuck using those little e-cigarettes that you found at 7-eleven which i just i never liked but then i found that there were flavors and there was a community of people in support of each other quitting smoking in support of the hobby that's found here and there were places in which we could go that we could test flavors in which we could build build community and and and and support each other in uh and try to get away from cigarettes i know in the last two months that i've been completely cigarette free uh i've already begun to taste them i've already been been able to breathe i can breathe a lot better i can taste i can smell um i can exert myself without gasping uh without go without fainting um i'm actually able to work for long periods of time to whereas before i could not do any exerted uh physical activity thank you so much for coming thank you hi my name is travis brisbane and uh i just want to say that i i'm proof that these work i was a smoker for 16 years i started when i was 12 and uh recently quit about uh been smoke free for about a year and i fully support uh vice chair olsens uh four zero seven three i do not believe that that miners should have access to these products however the 4115 uh restricting the use in the shops and at our vape meets where we get together and talk about these products and new things restricting that will be in my opinion detrimental to a lot of the success that comes with using electronic cigarettes you were talking earlier about giving gambling addiction and having programs for people to quit well these vape shops and our meetings with each other that's our program to stay off of tobacco oh that's cigarettes and if you take that away i just i don't know uh the health issues will will definitely take a blow thank you so much for coming to testify appreciate it thank you thank you manager so i called up several other people [Music] thank you i just had surgery sorry it seems that much to me to be here thank you that would trump 100 miles i i just had spinal cord surgery for the third time due to an injury not smoking related um my name is tommy deveraux earl i am also a registered nurse um and have been for more than a decade i worked in er and trauma and firsthand repeatedly have seen the effects of smoking i've held family members when they grieved through the loss of someone dying of copd who in the waiting room you know was wanting to smoke a cigarette or the patient that begs you to come down to smoke a cigarette and in that i was also smoking i thought i was a closet smoker now i know there's not such thing let me tell you i've vaped for five years longer than than than most here i searched and searched and searched for something and finally found something and it worked i remember you know having a code respiratory code and then i'd be on break and i'd go out to my car and try to suck down five cigarettes even though i just watched someone die [Music] i couldn't get through that finally i found this and and then through social media which i do i have over 400 twitter followers and 5 000 facebook followers and i did a lot to organize the group that's here today because we have a fellowship and that fellowship is through vaping if you limit how we are able to get together you i i will tell you i i have a vape meet in hillsborough we meet at coyotes once a month in the banquet room and last meeting i had 75 vapors that is 75 people not smoking and more come people come in people come out i can explain it to you i mean yeah the research is is that we do have research actually the burst in papers i don't know if anybody has mentioned those um let me pull it up sorry could you send that to us please i will send it that would be great because we have so many people here to testify um i will send that bit that would be weird let me just let me just say this is a grassroots movement this is not big tobacco this is not big farm we have a movement that started with the people and we designed a way to get off of cigarettes ourselves this is my personal nicotine device i made it cute i'm a girl and i like it way it's not appealing to a teenager i also make my own liquid and i have written an ebook on how to make it and i have for years helped people learn how to make their own we know what is in it there is the burst in papers igor burstin the drexel university school of public health did a study based on over 9 000 observations of e-liquid and vapor and found no apparent concern for bystanders exposed to e-cig vapor even under the worst conditions and i appreciate it if you would send that to it i i appreciate that this is my device okay there is a battery and a coil that i make and and wick which could be a cotton [Music] we we i disseminated through the group that that we would like to be respectful and not vape so i will not vape here for you but a one second demonstration i will just show you that it is just vapor i've seen that we did also that you've got to talk about with the state troopers out front while we were vaping and they were actually very interested and and nice to us and wanted to see what we were doing all it takes is an explanation thank you so much for coming especially your condition we really appreciate it thank you i would like um to be available if you ever have any further questions or work from a citizen in the committee please thank you thank you [Music] thank you madam chairman of committee my name is sam tom i work at fat boy vapors in gresham and i have a webcast internet show called a full frontal nerdy where we talk about vaping culture i'm also quite terrified to be here i've never been in a situation like this so please you're doing great 4073 i fully support this is not something i want to sell to kids i don't think that vaping should be geared towards children and i don't think it is currently people say because of the flavors that are produced that it's meant for children but i like cake as i recall there's a kind of smirnoff which is a vodka brand that is cake and liquor doesn't get talked about advertising to children as much as e-cigarettes have currently sampling the product is how i get people to stop smoking my mother is dying she's dying of cancer and pardon me she won't switch and i know for a fact i've talked to the doctors around her that she would feel better and breathe easier if she would but her addiction has been so ongoing that it will not be something she can get away from i couldn't get her started on this and if you restrict the ability of other people to get their family and their friends to stop smoking cigarettes which are proven to kill you and to start vaping which is proven to not kill you [Music] the health detriment is going to be incredible we're dealing major blows to tobacco just by doing this and i want to keep dealing those i want tobacco gone i want tobacco out of my system and i want to know everyone else's system as well thank you piping guy thank you so much and thank you thank you madam chairman say one more thing really fast nicotine is not only derived from tobacco it is derived we use it a pharmaceutical grade nicotine that is derived from many sources and if you could send that to it that would be real including tomatoes bell peppers that all of those contain nicotine as well thank you so much thank you adele adams i think obviously adele here and sarah okay you can be next [Music] okay and if you could just state your name and just start right on talking my committee is being great to stay here i appreciate it chair to my members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today and support a bill for 115. my name is adele adams and i'm here representing multnomah county working in the tobacco prevention education program with multnomah county health department i want to express the county's deep concern about the vapor products which are currently in use in our communities these products are being packaged and advertised and marketed particularly to youth yet these products are not regulated there's little research on the long-term effects of health for that reason multnomah county supports house bill 4115 to help protect the youth from accessing these products we appreciate legislators determination to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors and so we strongly support house house bill 4115 because it requires e-cigarettes to be included in the indoor clean air act and we believe that that's a critical piece without that inclusion we're creating an environment where vaping is considered an acceptable behavior and could become a normative youth uh culture for you here's what we do know and i won't repeat quite a bit of this because it's been talked about quite a bit today as far as the different studies that have been very quickly carcinogenic toxins that are in it so i won't go into that as much um but current smoking rates are down um in oregon from 57 among our 11th graders and 74 among our eighth graders since 1996. yet the use of e-cigarettes by teens and adults is on the rise and potentially creating addictions to nicotine among our youth deepening the addiction for current smokers and renewing the addiction for former smokers again talking about how these rates have doubled in the year of 2011 to 2012 in our young in our youth e-cigarettes are advertised in child-friendly flavors such as strawberry chocolate cotton candy and mint and in packaging that are smaller in size and appeal to young people we deeply are concerned about this product as being a genie in a bottle uh the bill will help protect our youth including e-cigarettes and the indoor cleaner act will help create an environment that discourages their youth thank you very much thank you for your time and if you have written material should people yes i want to be thank you for being here i want to be sure i understand are you talking on behalf of multnomah county through some action by the commissioners correct correct okay go ahead good afternoon noon chair to may vice chairs olson and gomberg and members of the committee my name is sarah hartstein and i am from the benton county health department i'm here to testify on behalf of the coalition of local health officials the association of oregon counties and the association of oregon community mental health programs in support of house bill 4115 with the dash five amendments electronic smoking devices or e-cigarettes are understudied and unregulated as you've heard smokeless at this point time does not necessarily mean that they are harmless the actual nicotine and chemical content of e-cigarettes does not always match the label as you've heard today the fda analyzed samples of e-cigarettes and found that they contained nicotine even though they were labeled as nicotine-free and that goes for different levels of nicotine as well some that were marked as high we're actually low in content some that were marked as low were actually higher the fda also found that samples of e-cigarettes contain chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects in the vapor i want to also add that e-cigarettes have also been used as a device for other drugs for example hash oil is now commercially available for use in cigarettes in washington and colorado it's no surprise that the use of e-cigarettes by youth is on the rise e-cigarettes are advertised in candy and fruit flavors that you've heard about today and they lack the legal age requirement that we're trying to address adele mentioned that youth rates have doubled and i will also mention that one in five youth that are e-cigarette users are not conventional tobacco users so that means that there's a possibility that they are creating a new addiction and if you remember ninety percent of smokers began their nicotine addiction before leaving their teens so the issue is really about nicotine initiation if you could sum it up give us written material would be fine yes house bill 4115 as amended would prohibit the sale of electronic smoking devices to miners and solution with any content not just nicotine content and prohibit use of electronic smoking devices indoors no matter what the content the coalition of local health officials the association of oregon counties and the association of oregon community mental health program urge you to support this important bill thank you very much thank you both come on and we is caleb hayes still here and um david glenn brennan venturi yeah if you wait just a minute after this group thank you go ahead hi um i'm travis mcdonald thank you madam chair and the representatives um i am a resident of hawaii um i'm representing hawaiian vapers the reason i'm here is i actually called some of these guys to come talking about wholesaling and they told me about this i got my car and i drove here um because it is like hawaii what's that from hawaii no from washington because i i live there yeah it's great it's back to the future and everything vapor approved but uh you know by hearing her story it is a tight community you know i smoked cigarettes from the time i was 11 to 3 and i'm 34. i quit six months ago because my sister came to me and said try this you quit smoking i laughed at her and i haven't smoked since now the question of if you're driving and does it look like a cigarette well does that look like a cigarette to you you know i mean hey i'm smoking a syrup no but at the same time i could say like the ones from the gas station yeah they might look like a cigarette and then it would be harder for a cop or what have you you know the whole point of me being here is you know to sell the miners no i mean that doesn't make any sense but the reason that they say oh strawberry this flavor that flavor because kids grow to be adults everybody loves those flavors you know i mean how can you say oh well kids are going to like it well you were a kid once of course you still like strawberry why does that dictate the difference between you know if you can vape it smoking cigarettes has four thousand carcinogens tar i'm not going to go in any those numbers you have all that information i'm just giving you a testimony of that this saved my life both my dad's my stepdad and my dad died from cancer you know they would be alive today and this was just three and a half years ago but i didn't know about it and guess what i did after they died i smoked a cigarette so i put myself in that same situation and now every single day when i give someone this whether they're 21 or 18 you know because they've got to be 18 right so 18 or they're 70 years old i feel that i'm helping those people every single time and when their kids bring their their mothers and their fathers in you know i'm helping those people every single time i've sold advertising all these things that maybe helps businesses do that but now i help people every single day and if you take that away from these people what do you think they're going to do go back to smoke with cigarettes you know and it's it's not bitter fun so thank you for letting me keep coming thank you for coming caleb tome members of the committee my name is caleb hayes i'm here on behalf of nasw the national association of social workers and our 1800 members right here in oregon here to testify in support of both bills at hand with the preference for 4115 i think it's been made clear by almost everyone in the room that we should ban the sale of these items to miners obviously we agree with that additionally we'd like to see these concepts go a little bit further and you know at the risk of going a little bit into the weeds you know we would love to see attacks on these and uh with that being said uh you know we support uh center um excuse me representative barnhart's concept mainly because you know i think it's clear to everyone now that we took too long to ban smoking cigarettes inside that i think there's a lot of science behind that why take that risk again uh with these products why don't we make sure that it's actually safe before we go ahead and let that happen thank you go ahead sir [Music] i'm not with this guy i gathered that um my name is david glenn i uh i am i'm the owner of fat boy vapers in gresham oregon um i was a smoker for 20 years um i would my whole naval career was uh one cigarette break after another i think and that kind of summed up my whole career sometimes um i was nearly two packs a day for the last 10 years that i smoked my brother bought me this little cigarette looking thing um it didn't work for me no he said it was vapor at the time it didn't work so he took me to a vapor shop up in lakewood washington uh called the vaporium where i got to sample and try flavors there were people there could show me what how it worked i didn't buy a pack of cigarettes after that i never bought one 20 years of smoking i've tried every device to try to quit smoking i've tried to patch i've tried chantix it put me in the hospital while i was on active duty it messed me up this worked as for how well my lungs are now they're still healing a lot of damage was done from smoking um but but i i can breathe better um than i used to i really believe in what it's doing when i got out of the navy i started going to college i couldn't smoke on the campus so there was a whole parade of people that would go off campus to get their cigarette so i joined them uh and started talking about vapor with them because it worked for me and i converted a lot of those guys to vapors and they don't smoke now and i was going to school for business so i started a business and i truly believe i'm saving lives it saved my life it saved some of my family members lives and the restriction that 114115 can put on retail stores being able to provide that service and helping people understand what it can do for them it does require the sampling to get that sensation of what this really could work um the underage thing we card people yeah uh representative olson his his bill prevents that i think that's great before one one five it goes way too far and it it there's so much more research that's needed and that's really all i got to say thank you great thank you thank you all to come to for coming to testify so who have i forgotten here sean is it bowers have i called you yet oh i called you sir come on up uh robert ward is he here um brennan venturi is that you yes okay you probably signed on both i did dalton larstad [Music] okay great i'm gonna allow someone else to do that okay go ahead is there anybody who signed oh i've got michael allen jones taylor jones pardon taylor jones taylor jones yeah go come on um michael allen jones so i have a michael allen jones is there anybody who's signed up that i haven't called you it's confusing okay um all right two more one two three okay all right all right go ahead hi um my name is brennan venturi i'm the owner of an electronic cigarette lounge in portland oregon also one down in springfield oregon and i'm here today to be in favor of 4073 i think that we already have uh signs posted on our door say 18 plus only we don't allow anyone under the age of 18 in on the premises um we don't believe what would be helpful is if you've already heard this testimony i agree with that we don't need to hear it again because it sounds like that there will be a lot of people who own the shops and you're you're carting people uh under 18 right so that would be great but if you've got something else new that you'd like us to know appreciate that yeah i do um i'd like to speak on the part of the clean air act um and that would be 41-15 right correct 41-15 um i am citing a study on behalf of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco published by oxford university um i'm just going to give you the conclusions i won't that would be great and you can send that to us and we'll put it on our files and look at it that would be great uh the conclusion is using an electronic cigarette an indoor environments has 10 percent less harm less nicotine content in it than conventional cigarettes also if you've ever been around it obviously there's a massive difference in in the odor and just the effect that's pretty much all i have on on four one one five okay thank you so much appreciate it thank you my name is dalton parsad a vape game co-owner and springfield store operator much like other stores you know we already carried everyone that looks under the age of 25 only sell to 18 years or older but on the top the topic of hp 115 i have to disagree because it feels preemptive it's not following all the evidence that's been gathered and will put undue restrictions on our trade customers shipping modes and industry as a whole i have a problem saying that electronic cigarettes or personalized personal vaporizers should be deemed the same as cigarettes especially since there have been several things positive from these and only the unconfirmed negatives have been focused on in the short term there are more relevant studies about the published about to be published that would help us and we need a chance to create a better organized and appropriate regulation not to mention the damage it would do to risking pay cuts and job losses for um i have 12 employees at my shop portland and eugene included you know uh the other stores you know other stores staff around around me or the outlying industries that support us and as well as the billion dollar subsection of our economy that this has become so thank you thank you for coming to us i appreciate that go ahead my name is taylor jones uh i'm i have two points to make and i'll make them as brief as i can uh i'm a molecular biologist trained at the university of oregon i have years a couple years of labs experience in research setting so i've i'm vetted in reading scientific literature i've read a lot of the studies the studies that listed the even the fda study the lists we've space where they say that we've tested cigalikes we've tested the cigarettes the e-cigarettes that look like cigarettes that's what they tested and they tested an older style of um e-liquid manufactured and old under old premises had diethylene glycol and it had impure nicotine that had the nitrosamines the whole tobacco alkaloid still in it that's no longer acceptable industry practices american eloquent manufacturing standards association uh has set up a framework for what is acceptable and what's not acceptable an e-liquid manufacturer none of the diacetyl diacetyl the diethylene glycol the and the and the purity of nicotine has to be so pure that it doesn't have the nitrosamines in it so that these things have been set up so that the secondhand vapor and the vapor is not as dangerous as even if the light amount of dangerousness that was found in some some of these older studies now the second point i want to make is that 4115 house bill 4115 restricts shops in such a way that it would force the consumer that wants to stay off of cigarettes and wants to continue using uh cigarettes to purchase the e-liquid first of all from other other states at the best case scenario where our organ money would go to out of state and second of all more and more likely is that they would be producing inferior products that would be made in china with inferior levels of inferior quality propylene glycol inferior quality vegetable glycerin inferior quality nicotine which would be a dire detriment to the vaping society as a whole and the health of oregonians as a whole so i you know i'm a father i don't want my kids to get a hold of this stuff until they're in until it's a face-to-face adult decision that they can make you know i don't want that i'm totally in support of olson's representative olson's bill but the house bill 4115 has has gone way too far and and and the impacts haven't been outlined by the writer and if you have scientific information that you're deciding i'll send you i will send you a list of links thank you just a quick question man i'm sure thank you is this product regulated at all by fda's or anyone that knows what's going in actually not yet but there are a bunch of manufacturers including me i'm the lab manager at vape game mm-hmm i'm the lab manager at vape game i have a vape game it's the same company it's in springfield oregon's the same company that these gentlemen own we go by ames the standard so there are lots of manufacturers that and and when you follow amesa standards you have to list which fluids that you might may or may not carry that do and do not follow ames standards the aims of certification process is a lengthy process we're in the midst of it but we meet these requirements and is anyone checking to make sure that yes aims to be a member of ames uh they can do like spot checking they do random spot checking and how do you spell that a e m s a dot org it's american e-liquid manufacturers standards association and you will send that to us yes i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry okay thank you all very much thank you and so there were some people who signed up and who haven't had a chance to speak yet come on up sir and tell me your name my name is paul bates paul bates and you did sign up i've got oh there you are and sean mcdonald come on up [Music] and robert wood ward robert ward what is your name sir back there steve jones he called me about come on up michael johns [Music] john's or jones jones jones got it michael okay go ahead my name is paul bates that actually sounds right um here today to both support four zero seven three and oppose four one one five there's been a lot of evidence given here in various levels of um elegance and eloquence um i'd like to say that i am current owner of division vapor in portland oregon i had been a smoker for 25 years seriously trying to quit for the last 10 and e-cigarettes are the only method i have found in all those years of trying to quitting that actually work gonna go beyond that a little bit right now you've heard the evidence we are hearing from tons of people thinking that vaping saved their life maybe saved your life right saved your life okay could you also put up your hands people who own businesses the businesses that sell these great thank you very much okay [Music] i'd like to say that [Music] 4115 misses the point in attempting to lump electronic cigarettes in with smoking completely misses the point of what it does it is a different process so completely different that you need proper background studies and everything else to build your own law rather than tacking it on to something that was a smoking law smoking is burning plant material you light it on fire it produces smoke which is absolutely a different process than vaporization you know smoke will set off your smoke alarm in your kitchen you start burning something on a pan smoke you boil water you do not set off your smoke alarms it is a different completely different substance paul i'm going to ask you to wrap it up everybody stay here very i'd just like to make that that point should be entirely clear to almost anybody who studies this subject and they're trying to listen to one pager and give it to staff then we'll make sure everybody gets it all right thank you paul thank you go ahead good afternoon my name is sean mcdonald and i began smoking college and only after a year of smoking it had terrible effects on my body and i knew i needed to quit so i set a goal to quit before i graduated from college and i was successful it took a long time and i kept kind of procrastinating on quitting i tried cold turkey from the patch and i figured you know what i had a buddy who had an electronic cigarette and i tried it and that was what worked now 11 months smoke free and recently i had my fiancee try it and she wasn't too pleased it wasn't until she was able to go into a store and find the light right liquid for her at the right nicotine strength that really did i took a smoker before this yeah i yeah i smoked for about a year she's my fiance about 10 years now okay at about 30 cigarettes a day which is now dropped to one or two i'm hoping soon that number is going to be zero we wish her good luck thank you thank you hi guys michael jones rock and vape i'm in albany and uh i just want to share a little story with you guys this reminds me a lot of of why we started this business um i have first-time customers that crumble their packs of cigarettes into the trash you know i have seen first-time customers tell me their very own testimony just like we have here some tell me this was their last chance you know some tell me they have tried chantix and still have nightmares from the fda you know i i still have you know customers that have actually just cried right on the spot after you get it and i understand if you if you're not a smoker and you've never been addicted to this you're not going to get it and i get that you know i get that but if you have and you've tried everything because i guarantee you most of the businesses that have gone into this this is passion this is straight passion and that's nothing more nothing less of it but we love what this product did for us and how we get to go and quit tobacco we are not tobacco there is no we are not tobacco am i right guys and i think if we want to take something away from this we're not big tobacco we don't support it and the little guys the little e-cigs that you see in the shops you know were the residuals from that not them they didn't create this we did and i think when we when we look back you know we want to we want it to be known that it wasn't them that got us here it was us this is about us saving us you know and all we want is a better life for ourselves so you know i thank you guys for staying late with us and uh i'm definitely in support of 4073. so much okay um jeff i there's some people i still haven't called just did i call justin newman okay so he's off edward is that you sir okay come on up sure oh and jane clark is that you okay so if i call uh sean bowers did i call him already and robert wood okay thank you again committee for saying oh and and oh tommy you were tommy right yeah terrific okay okay me all right because people signed up for both bills and so i'm just trying to here so go ahead hey my name is uh for the record my name is edward wiggins uh thank you madam chair and uh everybody else um i'm a new owner of newberg vapers in newberg oregon here uh i came across jacob over here he turned me on to electronic cigarettes and i quit smoking cigar i i quit smoking cigarettes i went to cigars and then now i'm done i pulled money out of my retirement that's how passionate i am on this my wife's quit smoking everything my main point is is i went from 20 milligrams of nicotine i'm now down to eight in in one month's time and my goal as a business owner is to pass that on to everybody else so they don't have to have either one it's about getting everybody off the tobacco onto the pen and then throw it away that's what i want i want to lose customers that it can go through a good question so i'm just going to ask briefly has anybody done that who went from cigarettes to vaping and then all yeah yes four customers that have done it okay good actually more than four customers have multiple customers that can come and testify that they quit totally good enough okay go ahead that was my whole point thank you i think most of these people back here that's where the different nicotine levels come in and it get people often done and so i support 40 78 but we need to be able to have our shops where we can gather okay thank you go ahead my name is jacob and i'm the owner of elite smoke station what's the owner of what what the earlier small station a smoke station elite thank you okay thank you i have been selling electronic cigarettes for over six months now in salem oregon and i got to meet a lot of people that were smokers with smoking switched to vaporizers and some of them are not even vaporizing anymore so i think that's a great point that they started with something switched to something else and then now they're doing nothing if you limit their ability to vaporize outside which there isn't enough research about the product that it says anything bad about it for people who are around vaporizers [Music] i think you're just gonna steal the opportunity from them to become those people that quit everything okay so thank you for coming to testify i appreciate that i support the bill by the way that super simple [Music] i'm going to make this really quick my name is jane clark and i've never done this in my life and i'm shaking in my boots you're doing great yeah so i called and talked to my staff yeah okay so i'm i'm 53 years old i smoked for almost 33 years i have five grand kids and and and three children my own i do not smoke cigarettes anymore thanks to the paper i don't own a business i'm just a customer where do you live jane you're doing great honey you're our last one we've got uh actually there's a little community called balls outside of amity okay i know yes i work uh am i allowed to say where i work if i shouldn't die i work for nordstrom good i've been there five and a half years and the last thing i'd like to say is thank you for allowing me to try these in public i'm down to 16 or 14 milligrams and i mean i never dreamt that i'd ever quit smoking i smoked a lot for a long time and the fda does not require on the things that i sell skincare wise uh to be tested either just saying i and i didn't know that this was going to be here today i heard about it and i asked if i could leave work early and they let me good that's all i'd like to say thank you thank you jane thank you for coming anybody who's not had a chance to testify who would like to come on up very quickly anybody else this is our last person [Music] so what is your name sir give me the opportunity my name is daddy smarty i'm actually the former fed again thaddeus marnie i love that name thank you oh my gosh you tell us late in the day um right i'm actually the former board member of an organization called the consumer advocates for smoke-free alternatives association that we absolutely uh promote the um uh education on tobacco harm reduction uh very familiar with joel niskanen glad to see him here today and i strongly encourage you to pay very close attention to what he had to share today um i wanted to um everybody here did such a great job i don't want to recap too much but i wanted to bring up a couple of things that haven't been brought up um specifically with 4115 because of excuse me i'm fighting up a little bit of cold myself but and i'm new to the whole process of politics and getting nervous but um because 4115 does not specify nicotine products in its inclusion of smoking products it would actually also include the use of e-cigarettes for cannabis under the oregon medical marijuana act as well as the likelihood of upcoming legalization and it's important to note that we have a lot millions of uh deathly ill medical marijuana patients in this state that need to have an access to their medicine without having to smoke it and if 4115 was passed they would not only they would actually have to basically return to smoking in many cases or not be able to use these smoke-free alternatives in places where they're not able to or to smoke because of the wide variety of places where smoking is prohibited by the oregon clean air act so i think it's very important to keep and keep that very much in mind that this not only affects those of us who are trying to get away from the harms of tobacco smoking but also uh cannabis patients who are trying to get away from the harms of smoking anything the the real bottom line and i really want to echo what uh previous statement said is the difference between fire flaming burning and smoking that's when you light something on fire that's what creates the ash that's what creates the carbon monoxide that's what creates the tar that's what creates the smoke and that's also what creates the fire hazards that's another issue you don't you're brought up very often you're not going to light e-cigarettes prevent forest fires i love it okay thaddeus thank you thank you very much one question thank you no i just wondered does that mean that currently um medical marijuana users can either smoke or vape marijuana in restaurants put all of the buildings that prohibit it it's possible you can use a vaporizer anywhere um it's not included in the oregon smoking cleaner act um but using vaporized products uh allows them to uh use them without an effect on um bystanders uh recent studies and i can refer them to the committee showing that uh vaporizing drastically reduces uh any uh toxins definitely to the user but but to bystanders to millions of levels times below what could possibly have any effect on bystanders yeah i'm just wondering about secondhand smoke oh and vaping marijuana and second-hand smoke is like okay he just raised another drastically it drastically reduces it drastically reduces that because it's vaporized when you burn some when you light something on fire you're actually producing particulate matter that's actually floating in the air and so it's spreading around when you're vaporizing it it's just a tiny tiny amount a heavy user uses less than a teaspoon a day of liquid thank you um thank you and there's just not much to be spread you're welcome to send something in writing thank you great thank you so much um representative gumberg thank you madam sharon and and thank you for extending this this hearing for nearly an hour i mean i've been in this room since one o'clock this afternoon but i learned a lot in the last two hours and i appreciate that very much i also wanted to say i'm really gratified to hear stories from people who testified today that that this new device has helped them get away from tobacco that that's very positive news as well i i have a question that i want to share with the group and i encourage them to answer my question in writing and i'll put that that material into our public record as well and and the question is this um we've heard from a lot of people that are recovering smokers tobacco smokers and they were certainly familiar with the current restrictions on tobacco smoking and they're essentially arguing that those restrictions should not apply to e-cigarettes as they do to tobacco cigarettes and some people address that rather directly but most people just simply said the bill goes too far i'd like to understand better the difference between tobacco smoking in public and e-cigarette smoking in public and part of the context for that is we had a very brief demonstration of vaping here very brief and i'll just say for the record that from here 10 feet away that we could discern the vanilla flavor the flavoring and it was very very brief but i think from 10 feet away my colleagues would agree we could smell it from here and i'd just like to understand better the context of public cigarette smoking and public e-cigarette smoking so write to me send me an email i will put it into the committee record thank you representative and i know i'm sorry man uh representative barnard is he still here get new glasses okay thank you madam chair again phil barnhart state representative house district 11. i've sat through this hearing i have learned some things today that i did not know i want the committee to understand that i prepared four different amendments having to do with demonstrations of products the one that i presented to you earlier the dash one amendment simply doesn't allow the demonstration of products i have heard today from people who are vehement about getting off of tobacco and they see this as a mean they see vaping as a means of accomplishing that and they point out and i think fairly persuasively that in order to get people who are chronic tobacco users to try something that may may help they claim it does i have no evidence one way or the other that they would like to be able to demonstrate the use of these products to the people who come into their vape shops i have prepared a dash three amendment which i think i shared with the chair i'm not certain it's on the it's on the list it's on the list i prepared a dash three amendment the dash three amendment does all the things the dash one amendment does except in line 18 and 19 pedestrian amendment says vaping is permitted in a shop that exclusively sells vapor products now when i first prepared this i thought this was very impractical because i thought obviously erroneously that people uh who were interested in demonstrations would want to demonstrate tobacco and and cigars and cigarettes and a buy a variety of other things and vapor products in the same place what we've heard today from the uh from the uh people who said that my bill goes too far is that they're not interested in tobacco products they want to get off of tobacco products and they see being able to demonstrate the use of their vape vapor products in their shops as a positive thing to help other people do that given that we given the situation that we're in i am perfectly willing for the committee to experiment with this issue to take them at their word to adopt the dash three amendment instead of the dash one that i earlier proposed because i'm convinced that at least the people who came to testify here who own vape shops are sincere in wanting to help people get off of of tobacco now i think it's really important for the committee to recognize that nobody in the testimony you've heard has suggested that it's okay for kids to use these products nobody has suggested that that was okay that suggests to me that despite all the other protestations that people have that there's a danger perceived at least in the use of vapor products otherwise why would we care if kids use them that leads me to the firm belief that we need to restrict the use of vapor products in public in the same way that we restrict the use of cigarettes in public the issue that has been raised over and over again today isn't really about that issue it's about the issue of converting people who are already addicted to tobacco products to something that is less harmful to them i'm willing to go there and that's why i propose that the committee consider the dash three amendment uh and let's take them at their word and let's see if they can actually make that work in in a way but i don't want to i don't want to expose the general public to additional nicotine products other products of that sort in the air that we breathe in the normal no smoking areas that's why i proposed a bill in the first place and i urge the committee to uh to uh to pass the uh the basic bill that i've already proposed but this one wrinkle might be useful for those people who are zealous about helping other people get off of the use of of tobacco cigarettes one other comment if i may it is already unlawful to use uh marijuana in any form uh uh in in a way that would put something into the air in a public place marijuana is more restricted than the use of tobacco so the the last witness before me who was talking about that i think is incorrect i'm sorry that mark mayer left because he would be the person who could give you a definitive statement about what the rule about marijuana is but is my understanding that it is not legal now to to use marijuana in a way that puts it out into the air and my my able staff just handed me a statue that that includes the dangerous weapons on the bottom and limitations on immunity at the top for marijuana and and i'm it is i'll just give you the statute number because i can't read it in a minute it's rs-475.316 i suggest looking at that and also checking with with mark mayer about that issue but it is my understanding at least that it would be unlawful for a person to put hashish or some other thc type product in a in a vape product even if they're even if they are using it for medical reasons and use it in a public place now that this bill doesn't have any effect at all on that issue thank you representative any quick questions welcome to the human services and housing committee she's brand new to the legislature this is her third day so we're so happy to have her did i ask you yes so the um actually my mind was kind of going in the same direction as yours and i appreciate you um lighting up your your e-cigarette because i actually haven't seen it and i've heard from a lot of people that they've been next to someone in an airport who's done it and that it actually really bothered them and i didn't know what it was about but i got a very strong whiff too and so that does raise concerns for me about being in a restaurant or next to someone in a train station or those kind of places and so i like the direction that it's going and i wonder if out of the people all the people who own the vaping stores here are there if the earth says the vaping is permitted in a shop that exclusively sells vapor products does that include everyone here all of your shops exclusively sell vaping products yeah yes or is there any other sodas [Music] so i just wonder i'm sorry you cannot speak from the audience okay so i just wanted to be clear because some of you maybe haven't seen the amendment if you have any suggestions about that language we are in a very tight timetable i encourage you to um to contact representative barnhart absolutely any last comments representative olson you've been very patient anything okay anything else i you know i don't i'm sorry no um i asked the committee not you um so i don't usually allow applause even though we did have some plots earlier on but usually we don't but i want you to applaud yourselves you were very patient you stayed here a very long time to listen to a lot of testimony about bills about which you had no interest and you were very patient to stay and you were very polite here and we really appreciate it so i'm going to give you a nice yay with that we're going to close the public hearing and the work session on house bills 41 15 and 40 75 and we will carry both of these bills over again thank you very much thank you committee you
TlbHVqXTsGo,OR,4-10-2017,10 minutes late now we've given everybody thank you the revenue committee for april 10th 2017 will come to order colleagues are going to go slightly out of order today and start with the information meeting on the tobacco tax distribution and with a little luck uh more of the members will we'll get here before we get too far into this i'm not sure what's holding them up today but but we are now late kyle please good afternoon mr chair members of the committee kylie's legislative revenue office and i'll try to talk very slowly yes um no so uh paul just asked me to come up and do a little background on the the uh tobacco distribution of tax receipts uh so i thought i'd just run through a couple of documents that are available for reference that'll show how the receipts work through the system and really you can at a high level you can think of it there are two two initial pockets uh that tobacco receipts are placed into those that are derived from the cigarette taxes and those that are other tobacco which includes more or less everything that's not a cigarette so you'll find up on olis under the meeting materials for today's date it's not under any specific bill but i have a few documents up there the first one is just the overview the tobacco overview this is included in part of our basic facts document let's put out the the beginning of the session and it goes through just some background on uh the taxes the tobacco taxes themselves where they're imposed and what amounts but i do have the distribution and i'll go through in a little bit more in depth the cigarette distribution just a second but it does talk about um the distribution of the other tobacco products and it's a fairly simplified distribution so you have three um for the dollars that come in related to the otp taxes collected after accounting for uh distributors are allowed to keep uh up to 1.5 percent of the tax to cover their admin costs and then department of revenue can also cover their admin costs so after those two admin cost portions the remainder are distributed as as you can see in the chart there where it's about 54 is going to the general fund uh 41.5 to the oregon health plan and then the remaining 4.6 is going to tobacco use and reduction account and that's for it doesn't uh matter the tobacco product what uh whether it's moist enough or it's um something other than moist enough cigars or something of that effect and that's considered other tobacco so that's not a cigarette it follows that distribution schedule so it goes into one of those three goes to find one of those three programs there the cigarette tax distribution on the other hand is a little bit more complicated and i have a couple documents up here the first one is related to 2016. it covers the 2016-2017 uh years there is a one uh one penny increase scheduled for january 1st 2018 per pack one penny increase per pack so i have that distribution schedule up there as well but i'll just go ahead and go through the 2016-2017 one which will look the same with the exception of that one penny increase that will start next next year but so the cigarette tax it's it's imposed and i put everything up here per pack this is per pack of 20 cigarettes there are three different statutes that actually impose taxes on cigarettes so it's a good thing to keep in mind in some cases when you see uh legislation that is increasing the tax it may only touch one of these statutes and that's important because these statutes do have different allocations for those dollars that come in so it's specific to one of these three statutes then controls the distribution so the chart i have down here it's a little small there uh it shows these are the overall collections and how they get distributed both on the cents per pack or by percentage terms so you can see the oregon health plan is getting about 65 percent of if you're looking on that dollar dollar 32 per pack of cigarettes that's the tax that's imposed on the oregon level uh the oregon health plan is getting about 65 percent of that dollar 32 or 86 cents per pack and working working backwards it would be the general funds getting 22 cents per pack about 17 percent and then mental health 14 cents and then you have uh tobacco use and reduction getting three cents and the cities counties and department of transportation's elderly transportation fund each get two cents per pack and again i set it up where you can follow through a little bit from each of the statutes where that distribution is and you can see one of the the more recent uh increase i think this is trying to remember the years a few years back when there was an additional 13 cents per pack placed on cigarettes that was an ors 323 0 30 sub 4 and that puts it 100 percent of that distribution is going to oregon health authority in their mental health program and so again that's just something to keep in mind when you're seeing the different bills that may make changes or adjusting the tax rate on cigarettes is sometimes it can it can look more complicated in some cases just because it may be holding the existing distribution constant and then adding a new one on there or it may just send it through with the exact same distribution so there may be an additional program that's getting funded but it can look a little odd because you can see there's that split of 30th 29.37 30th and so forth and then the last document i have up on olas um is coming from the distribution i actually don't see it up there okay there it is um is just the distribution of the receipts and this comes from the or the office economic analysis in their quarterly forecast there's a page in there that has the distribution to each of the funds and this has for both the otp and the cigarette tax distribution so if you want to see the actual dollars that are coming in on an annual or biennial basis you can reference that document as well okay and that's what i have prepared as a little background i'm happy to take any questions yes johnson please sure kyle um the oha money i see that i think the one um distribution in the middle here that's related to mental health i think was the byproduct of the 2013 grand bargain correct yes that goes to mental health do we know whether the other portion that they get via the other parts of the cigarette tax have a specific purpose within oha just general fund oha type usage do we know whether there's any health related benefits perhaps at least in theory or is there anything we quantify yes chair barn representative johnson it usually directs it to it's fairly broad so it is something specific to the oregon health plan so it could be funding any i guess any relation to the oregon health plan there's not maybe a specific program to yeah smoking suppression or something like that all right thoughts you know just it'd be nice to know i guess since it's the largest beneficiary of the cigarette tax and know what what consumers are getting for that investment that makes sense can we find out can definitely yeah get information to follow the dollars through the program yeah that would be good any other questions has has anybody recently tried to simplify this distribution symptom a system maybe even without sorry slip of the time maybe even without um uh changing the actual distribution because it looks pretty complicated yeah mr chair i think part of the pro is even in the rounding it can change the dollar allocations is more low so you do sometimes when the bill changes yeah but even when you just round it to a tenth or something without effect someone someone's gaining some and some someone is losing a little all right well we have a number of bills colleagues that that will affect the amounts of these taxes and maybe even the distribution so i thought you probably better have a look at this first and you can see there are a lot of different interests represented in in the in this in this distribution anything else uh yes uh representative smith chair and i apologize if this was brought up already but the um the did we talk about the elderly transportation and how that got in there originally i have not i can research that i don't know okay i just wondered if you like or perhaps one of my colleagues might be i do remember that but i'm gonna i want to make sure it's 100 accurate so i'm going to refrain but i do remember that i keep thinking of how valuable it is to have a ways and means member on this committee as well thank you appreciate the presentation today given our our schedule this afternoon and the and the timing for the when people can attend we're going to close the information meeting and open a work session on house bill 2676 we have a little bit of an unusual process today representative vance and then i'll discuss what we're doing mr chairman movie reconsider the vote by which house bill 2676 was sent to the floor with the due pass as amended recommendation thank you representative vance moves to reconsider the vote by which house bill 2676 was sent to the floor with a due pass as amended recommendation let me just start by by saying this is an unusual procedure but once in a while we get new information that suggests that we need to have additional discussion maybe even additional hearing perhaps about a bill so i thought in the best the most prudent thing we could do since we're not anywhere near the end of session was to pull this thing back so we can consider it further and i think i've talked with most of the members about it so that we could proceed other discussion joining objection to the motion hearing none it is so ordered um now do i need to do something else i think we need now to do the reconsideration don't we or did we do the whole thing all in one just the whole thing oh do i need to do any any additional just brought it back to them we brought it back to the committee but uh but now we need to move to rescind the vote by which we send it to the floor isn't that correct okay uh representative knows would you make that motion are you prepared to um i'm prepared to do it but i could use a little help on how to actually word it i think what you say is yeah i moved here to send them the vote uh motion by which the vote by which we sent the bill to the floor with the do-pass recommendation i'm going to say we johnson thank you for all your help um mr chair i would like to rescind the motion that i made sending house bill 2676 to the floor with a do pass recommendation thank you representative nos moves that the committee rescind the uh vote reconsider the vote and rescind it by which we sent house bill 2676 to the floor with a due pass recommendation i think that gets us to the place where we had it in the work session before uh and able to able to keep it in the committee so that we can do further consideration any further discussion can i just give it please represent now so mr chair members of the committee um we're going to have a meeting myself uh i believe let's say council let's let's the revenue staff are going to be there uh the advocate for the bill folks in the department of revenue and try to figure out what the concern is i don't remember the exact date but um i know it's coming it's coming and i think we're going to try to move the meeting here uh see if we can get a handle on the new information that's come to light or what we didn't understand when we passed this bill and then maybe get back to you thank you representative vance mr perhaps you can explain to everyone what you explained to me uh so that they know yeah briefly uh what is my understanding is that what has happened recently is that an appeal was made of a of a tax decision made by the department to a one of the forms which makes the information public information and no longer confidential the result of that was that i got a visit from the department indicating that there were some issues that we had not heard from about earlier and it raises for me in addition to the bill another consideration which we haven't hit at all and that is how do we manage situations in which we're hearing uh a part of the of the uh of the facts related to a bill and other parts might be available but not but not to us because of confidentiality but because those pieces are no longer confidential we will get the benefit of that information and it may may or may not influence the decision of the committee to send the bill along is that is that helpful i think it's what we've talked about before any uh any further discussion any objection to the motion hearing then it's so ordered with that we'll close the work session on house bill 2676 and we'll move on to the public hearing on house bill 3296 thank you [Applause] okay um mr chair members of the committee house bill 3296 would add a tax on certain types of nicotine products that don't contain tobacco they would be nicotine products that could be ingested however there's no actual tobacco in it they are awaiting an amendment for this measure it's not in yet but it would uh make it so that this uh this measure did not apply to certain food products it turns out that there are some vegetables in the nightshade family that naturally contains some nicotine and without an amendment this measure would add a tax on those um so that's that's um being awaited i wonder why i liked eggplant so much well nightshade of course includes potatoes eggplants tomatoes and probably two or three other things that we many of us like to eat please go ahead is that it okay all right ah let's see we've got a lot of people signed up here today why don't we hear from the state departments first katrina head head is it hedberg indiana mack then also perhaps in the league wendy johnson so it looks to me like the three of you have some information to add that might be helpful so why don't we start with you mine will be very brief thank you um chair barnhart membership committee my name is wendy johnson here on behalf of the league of oregon city uh of oregon cities it's sort of a transition from the the presentation that that kyle just gave on tobacco and how that tax is distributed cities do receive a portion of the tax revenue from cigarettes it's very small it's that two cents we do not receive any tax revenue from the other tobacco so i and you've had plenty of vaping bills already in this committee and now this ingestible piece so my testimony is simply that we would like to see a revenue share from these other tobacco products the cities are responsible for policing this issue now that for example vaping it can't be done by miners the cleaning the oregon clean indoor act that passed recently added vaping to the list so we have that cost as well and so as you think about just the distribution method of any new taxes we would ask that you consider the cities and counties in that distribution it's as you noted it's a very complicated um formula for the cigarette tax we would not suggest anything that complicated but especially if there's a preemption what's particularly offensive to the cities is that when this the cigarette tax was initially imposed there was a preemption but cities received 25 percent of the cigarette tax and now you know it's two percent in addition 50 percent went to property tax um assistance so essentially 75 of the cigarette tax originally helped out the local governments and now we get two percent um and so some of you have received the league's brochure on what our state shared revenues look like it's now less than a dollar 20 a person of what we're getting in cigarette revenues um it doesn't pay for the the costs and we're preempted from imposing that tax locally so that's all my testimony is just to consider how you should distribute any new taxes on these new products that have now really replaced cigarettes which we think is is helpful perhaps better than some of the other products out there but um the tax situation has not changed so thank you very good thank you okay mr chair members of the committee for the record deanna mac department of revenue and the bill um as drafted we just have some technical changes that we would like to request right now it deals with tobacco substitutes that do not include vape products containing tobacco or products prescribed by health professional for smoking cessation yet many of them are fda approved and they're over the counter like nicorette gum so we'd want to make sure that it was clear that those are also included in this definition so the tax would not be imposed on that as well as some other minor technical changes relating to the terms tobacco and tobacco substitute and we're happy to work with lro to make sure that those if the bill continues to move that it has uh the correct language in it for us to administer okay thank you and do you have an amendment or i have i do have language when you provide okay yeah thank you because we're obviously going to need your help to get that part done happy to do it thanks chair barnard members of the committee i'm dr katrina hedberg i'm the state health officer with the public health division of the oregon health authority and i'm here to testify or provide information about the importance of making sure that tobacco substitute products are treated the same as other nicotine containing tobacco products so again i appreciate what you said about small amounts of nicotine in fruits and vegetables we want people to eat fruits or vegetables we're talking about products that specifically people are using because of the nicotine concentration in those products so part of the issues around nicotine nicotine in and of itself and high levels can cause some toxicity it can cause rapid heart rate kids for example who have a nicotine toxicity it's a stimulant so anxiety hypertension nausea vomiting in fact there have been cases of actually nicotine poisoning deaths when children contain so nicotine in and of itself in high concentrations is dangerous we're of course concerned about the other component of nicotine which is that it is highly addictive and we know from use for e-cigarettes for example that are nicotine containing that there are many people who use this who use tobacco products crossover they use sort of both e-cigarettes as well as other tobacco products tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of both morbidity and mortality so illness and death in the state of oregon we've also seen when new products come online for example e-cigarettes we saw a sudden bump up in the increase of e-cigarettes among youth so these types of products particularly appeal to young to youth and young adults and then many of them become addicted to nicotine and then have a lifetime habit related to tobacco addiction we also know that taxing tobacco products and including tobacco substitute is an evidence-based practice for decreasing use overall and this is something that at the centers for disease control when we're looking at how we limit the negative consequences of tobacco use increasing the price of products is one is one way that we do that um so i'd be happy to answer any um additional questions thank you thank you very much questions for this panel represent johnson i think mr chairman the question could be for you or for our doctor here but help me understand what we're talking about here again what exactly are we referring to it's not tobacco it's not vaping it's not it's not for that sort of thing what is this tobacco substitute page three alliance statute lines four through nine or ten is the definition of tobacco substitute but again that doesn't give me a product name oh yeah okay so chair barnard and representative johnson i myself so i had some questions so what we find obviously cigarettes cigars pipes we're all aware of what tobacco is then of course there's also the snuff and the tobacco which is is fine then there are things like orbs which include nicotine but they're more like a little candy they look like tic tac but again the nicotine in those is derived from tobacco but i think what we're talking about here is nicotine that's not derived from tobacco so it doesn't fall under that taxation but is a synthetic a tibetan or derived perhaps from some of the other vegetables that you mentioned members of the deadly nightshade family in oregon or in the united states now we understand that there's something called zinn nt which is sold by a swedish tobacco company which is similar to some of these other products and oregon is a test market for this so i think it's not in wide distribution but we are aware of these products and they have the potential of coming online again when you look at other products that are regulated other tobacco derived nicotine products and this is a way to say oh they don't fall under that but for all intents and purposes they are the same as some of these other ingestible if you will forms of tobacco please so if i wanted to purchase some of these products where would i go who sells this stuff so dear barnard represented johnson i personally don't know right before i came up here i texted it again oregon's a test market i think you're you can actually get some of them online which is in and of itself a problem but um there are potentially sites of distribution once they see whether this test market whether it flies in oregon what we found when e-cigarettes started so this was an example after they got on the mark and were here for a while we started to see them popping up in malls for example and being sold we do not see that yet so i think in some ways this is a little bit preemptive that it hasn't happened wide scale yet um but that we have concerns that it may be going in that direction right thank you i think you answered this question but i'm not sure is nicotine something that can be artificially manufactured or does it have to be derived from from some kind of a plant process or do we know so chair barnard i don't know but i can get you that information because of course you know it's i mean nicotine is a is a chemical and so many substances both are naturally derived from plants that's where they start and then there is a synthetic you know they're manufactured in you know chemical laboratories etc i don't know the answer for nicotine but i can find that out for you thank you and what i understand this bill does is that it simply says that they have to they have to pay the tax that you would pay if it were nicotine if it were a tobacco product even though it it contains nicotine but it is not a tobacco product correct that's my understanding of what this bill would do and of course it it falls the foul of the nightshade issue simply because the other nightshade something i didn't know until 10 minutes ago contain apparently contains some nicotine that may explain why i like tomatoes so much who knows so chair barnard i also think that it's a probably a matter of degree my guess is that the tomato that you enjoy or the eggplant doesn't have a very large amount of nicotine in it and of course these products that we're talking about have much larger because the purpose is that again they're a mild so they're a stimulant we know that nicotine is a stimulant and also highly addictive and it's that that's what people are looking for which again i'm not sure people are eating tomatoes for the stimulation effects thank you the wiley tomato growers i didn't i had no idea anything else for this panel thank you very much thank you very much very much appreciate your testimony thank you uh kenny uh matthewson there was there was a simpsons cartoon about combining tobacco and i don't know if you have someone else for your panel or not no how about tomatoes and tobacco tomato simpson's episode about this all right so maybe that's where they got it thank you for sending those yes uh cher barnhart members of the committee katie tyson with the oregon nurses association i will keep my comments really brief here um just wanted to testify in support of the bill today because although we know that combustible tobacco products are the most dangerous there's certainly a lot of evidence that ona nurses are aware of that nicotine is equally bad and can cause a number of diseases from heart disease to lung disease so we just want to support taxing all nicotine products at their broadest capacity and that taco tobacco substitute products be regulated the same and that we know increasing the price of these products is the best way to curb youth access in particular so with that i'll be happy to answer any questions but just wanted to testify in support of the bill what do we know about the if anything at this stage about the nature of uh first use and and continued utilization of these products we've we've heard in other bills for example we've heard testimony how vaping may in fact for younger people lead to the use of of regular tobacco products um the nicotine is highly addicting i think at this by this by this point everyone should know that um what do we know about this the kind of product that we're trying to deal with here in that in in those areas epidemiologically i guess and probably i should have asked the epidemiologist this question yeah i i don't have a specific answer to you but um you know as nurses our members really believe that opening the door to any uh nicotine or tobacco product is a bad idea because of that sort of further down the line effect so i'd be happy to try and find that answer for you and get back to you because i think it is a really interesting idea chamber thank you dr hedberg did you have additional information on that point because if you do i'd love i think the committee would like to hear it yeah so chair barnard members of the committee we do know that the majority of people who are tobacco users or lifetime users started before the age of 18. so and at least before the age of 21 in other words nobody wakes up my age in their late 50s and says i think i'll try a cigarette it just doesn't happen people also don't start by not smoking today and then tomorrow becoming a pack a day smoker so we do know that the pattern of use is initially trying and that eventually there are some people who will try a few and stop but the majority of folks will try and then especially if it's it's part of the um the broader social or cultural group that they're in become addicted and pretty soon they are not able to quit all right and i i think your assumption it might very well be that products like zin nt will follow a similar pattern um so yes chair barnard so it's not clear to me um which product again we know that if you start with e-cigarettes uh the the kids i call them that youth who start often go over to other tobacco products that they don't necessarily say stay the same so my guess is that and we also know that products such as hookah which are tobacco but are flavored tobacco that that appeals to the youth because it's sort of easier to inhale and the same with e-cigarettes they often have candy flavors etc that appeal to youth and then they become addicted so i would say it is a fair assumption although again we don't have obviously data yet since oregon is just a test market about whether zen and t would end up the same way but my guess is that when you're using an oral product that's relatively easy to consume if you will it's not quite as harsh as a camel unfiltered cigarette is to start but it still contains nicotine that it's an addictive substance and that then that person may or has the potential for the lifetime of addiction thank you other questions thank you very much uh i'm sorry representative smith thank you mr not necessarily for the panel i just want to make sure i'm understanding this correctly so what we're talking about is a 65 percent of the whole sales sales price on all tobacco substitutes that's yes how did we how did we choose 65 is it just as out of convenience because that's the same rate for other tobacco products or was there another rationale there's nothing wrong if it's that convenience because it's the same as others i just i'm assuming that's the reason yeah mr chairman representative smith it is the same um couldn't speak to the reasons necessarily behind that except for some uniformity okay consideration that's always trying to get out thank you thank you mr chair thank you and i you know again we probably would need additional testimony on this topic but it occurs to me that you don't want to give advantage in the marketplace to one kind of ingestion system or or type then a different one and setting the tax in a similar level would would help with that uh process now that seems logical to me mr chairman i was just trying to make sure that was the reason thank you uh thank you very much thank you for your testimony uh joseph gilpatric and charles wyatt pleaser does not apply to nicaragua is there anyone else who wants to be heard today on this bill gentlemen thank you representative my name is joseph gilpatric um i was a 22 year smoker i i started smoking cigarettes at the age of about 15 years old um and my mother was a two pack a day smoker at the time when i when i'd be kind of smoking um well um prices of cigarettes increased through several decades um my mother still addicted to pack a day smoker um i just wanted to share um you know moments of when my mom decided if i should get my lunch money or a pack of cigarettes and you know an addicted person as as many people will testify you know tobacco is just as addictive as sometimes heroin or cocaine i and i urge you to you know maybe go down to the jail and talk to a heroin or cocaine dealer and ask them if they raise the price of their drugs how many people stop purchasing their products it doesn't seem to work that way so the more we raise these products on people that are already financially burdened you know these people that are addicted to tobacco um are in the lower class range you know 20 000 a year or less and so you know we we raise the price on these products that we know that they're going to purchase and pay for because they're addicted with the justification of saying that they're not going to purchase them anymore well well this is a 50-year smoker 45-year smoker now now these products in this bill particularly um you know as that zen enqueue that is a chewing gum that is designed exactly like nicoderm cq it's the um just a non-fda approved exact replica of that from a different company now as we know nicotine is not cancerous it is a stimulant like caffeine and it has a lot of health issues as far as people with heart problems but it is a much much healthier much safer alternative than smoking and for us to put it on an equal plane for a chewing gum a nicotine supplement and a cigar or some chew it just doesn't really make sense to me and for for you know um for for us to make a tax on something just because we know these people are going to pay for it shouldn't make it right and i i believe you guys know that true thank you very much thank you yes sir hello representative barn barnhart and members of the committee my name's charles wyatt and i just kind of want to start off by saying i think taxation against these products that have already been shown to be healthier not the best but to be healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes i think there should be no no taxation if somebody chooses to make a healthier option to work towards a healthier future then they shouldn't be financially burdened like joe said uh most of uh cigarette consumers are of the lower you know lower class don't make as much money and i want to make somebody that's making those healthier choices you know give them less of a financial burden like when we look at a look at new york who taxes our cigarettes at a it you know a staggering rate of 4.35 cents a pack um we notice when we look at the numbers that 58 percent of users get their cigarettes from black markets from out of state or just end up buying cheaper cigarettes to begin with and 58 that's almost 6 out of 10 people that buy cigarettes in new york state because of the taxation goes to other other revenues and if you think that that uh the person sneaking cigarettes across state lines is gonna id that person buying cigarettes then then you know that's gotta be a pretty honest person um pennsylvania and i understand vaping is not this hasn't anything to do with vaping um but seeing as other you know their other options of quitting smoking that that are um that are healthier than smoking you know pennsylvania passed a 40 tax on on vapor products and six months shut down 33 percent of establishments on you know selling those products and that's a lot of people losing their jobs alex clark from casa said it sounds like a bad joke but it's all too real pennsylvania vapers could go to prison for buying vapor products online and not paying a 40 tax on them the penalties for evading the tax includes up to a five thousand dollar fine or prison time not to exceed five years and the reality of that situation is that these taxes are allowing the government to go to somebody's house to somebody's house with a swat team and hold a gun to their head and force them into prison for tobacco or alternative products you know if i want if if these taxes were to pass on the way that i choose to consume nicotine i would be considered a criminal because i can afford those types of taxes and if it's between paying those taxes or putting a roof over my pregnant wife's head it's going to be putting a roof over my pregnant wife's head and and i am i am addicted to nicotine thank god i found a healthier alternative but all that being aside i just i don't see any philosophical consistency um with this and things like sugar when i was one year old one years old and drinking massive amounts of kool-aid and such sugar is a stimulant sugar is just as addictive as heroin and cocaine and you know they're they're the obesity crisis here's here's tobacco and here's obesity but i don't i don't see anybody you know i don't see any anybody saying anything about sugar and the the negative implications that sugar has on children and there's just no consistency and and for that reason i'm i just want to see people get healthy and i want to see people burning as little as they possibly can if they're making those those steps forward to become healthy thank you so much thank you very much for your testimony questions for this panel gentlemen thank you we appreciate your testimony thanks again with that we'll close the public hearing on house bill 3296 and reopen the public hearing on house bill 2363 and we'll see if any of the people who wanted to testify last time and didn't get to are back colleagues recall we we were hearing this uh thursday afternoon um and i my recollection is that there were three people who wanted best five we're down to run or maybe maybe the department's ready as well oh okay please are there those who are standing please come up plus wendy johnson please no no that's fine chair bernhard i didn't really want to testify but you gave me a little homework last week so i did yeah i did give you some homework why don't you state your name and then and then respond to the homework question um chair barnhart members of the committee mark arts with the department of revenue property tax division so last week if you recall you had a question at the end of the hearing for the department and you just basically asked if there were any safeguard or and you can certainly reset your question if you'd like but you basically asked if there were any safeguards in the bill that would protect the money that the county was already spending on a t and so you said your concern as i understand it was that because the county would have this new source of money in the two percent fee that they could charge the districts that they would just turn around and reduce their own contribution and so i think the short answer is that uh the bill as drafted or with the dash one amendment does not have a lot of that assurance in it but i want to let you know that i worked with representative brock smith and with representative marsh also was there and and we did a little bit of working on this to try and fine-tune what what an amendment that would take care of that might look like and so a couple of ideas that are out there and again the amendment's not drafted at this time and ultimately it'll be up to the to the sponsors of the bill as to what it looks like the department's neutral on whatever the policy would be but i think that we might be looking like some at something that might have a provision that basically says that while a county may have to reduce their budget because they simply don't have them the money that they would not be able to reduce their budget for a t for assessment taxation to any more degree than the overall budget reduction that the county goes through in any given year so that would be one thing that could could tend to address your issue secondly i think that we're going to move to say that you're only able to charge this two percent fee if you're a participant in the kafa program and that will make sure and right now all counties are members of the kaffa program we're all participating in the kaffa program and as a part of that grant review process it gives us a pretty good peek under the hood as far as what type of resources they're dedicating to assessment and taxation so that would be the second thing and then the third thing that the amendment will seek to address is that it will require some type of enhancement or augmentation or increase in the county a t function if a county takes this option to charge the two percent fee and so the thought here is that it could be perhaps by rule the department of revenue might set some standards but overall it's going to be a matter of resource so dollars and staffing is what the issue is really going to be for the department to say that you're enhancing the effort that you're putting into a t and and so i think that the the long and the short of it should be that after you look at kaffa the county's contribution plus the two percent that should be greater than what was being spent prior to the two percent on just kafa and the county portion so those are some thoughts that we've come up with and certainly there's a little bit more work that can be done but in the bill as written currently all we have is the kafa grant process and you know when the department does like i said give a hard look at these counties and we have been approving all of the counties as being minimally adequate at this time but we have put some of the counties on notice that we feel like their funding levels currently may not be sustainable in the long run to have a healthy assessment and taxation system we feel like there could be some counties where role values are suffering a little bit and we've told them that we may require them to increase their contributions at the county level in the future if they are to continue to be participants in the cafe program thank you um these are people are all talking about different topics so if we have questions for mark let's ask them now um the one i have a couple a couple of ones i've got i guess one of them is uh we we're a lot weird testimony on thursday uh i think it was curry county if i remember correctly about the uh claim that sufficient uh additional property tax scholar dollars could be obtained by adequate properly assessing properties to pay for this amount and actually return a little bit more to the districts that were that were contributing toward it it seems to me that if we were to proceed with a bill like this we'd want to have assurances in the law that would make it clear that the effort that was in being involved would actually allow the assessor to fulfill that claim or at least to do all the work from which it could be fulfilled if he's right about the number and size and percentage of properties that are not properly uh assessed now i think that's a little different than what you said but i'm not sure so um chair barnhart i i think that you know the amendment language that we're looking at i think does point to that issue and it just says that basically things are going to have to get better at the county level than than where it's at right now in order for you to be able to utilize this this two percent fee option um the you know there was also testimony on thursday about the district one project that they had where they put more money into personal property collections you can understand how for a county knowing that they're only going to get a sliver of that money it's i don't know if they can consider it to be a wise use of the resources for the county budget for everyone it did bring in more money that district one project but had the state not been paying for it it would have been a big it would have been a loser for the county budget and that was i think the point that they tried to make as far as whether this will actually bring in more money or not that is a good question and hard to quantify i think but i right yeah and the the other question i had had to do with i think section one of the bill i don't have it in front of me but that's my recollection uh it has to do with and if i'm thinking of the correct bill has to do with the qualifications uh for what counties are allowed to participate it would seems to me that a different method of determining that might be prudent chair barnard i think that that'll also be part of the amendments i think that um the the latest direction is um maybe that you would say that counties with less than a two dollar permanent rate would be eligible to use this that would put 12 counties in that would include lane county where i live well there you go and so it would put more counties in and it would avoid what could be a yo-yo effect over time where a county might qualify to use this fee in one year and then in subsequent years they get taken off the secretary of state's list and then that two percent option is no longer available to them and so they're back into instability with their budgets into the soup all right thank you uh ladies please chair barnhart members of the committee wendy johnson here on behalf of the league of oregon cities um as you might guess the league opposes this measure as well as the dash one amendment um it's literally taking from one taxpayer and making another taxpayer um pay for these fees um to get assessment and taxation done um i think a rising boat and a the water you know rising tide raises all boats that's that's true here but this is shifting it all to the other taxing districts um we just don't think it's the right solution um the league has been working on property tax reform for quite a number of years and we recognize that if we go back to a real market value system we're definitely going to need more money for assessment and taxation um but we're not there yet this session on on making that happen um and and we also agree that we need to fix the ent funding with what the system we do have this just isn't the right solution for a number of reasons um the first that should be obvious is 41 of property taxes come from schools and so this bill is going to be taking from the school budget which means you're gonna have to backfill it with general fund dollars anyway so i don't have the math now that you've gotten it if you do the dash one amendment um with only the four counties but if you do it with the bill as it's written it would be a loss of 104 million dollars from the school budget um so this is real real money here um that we're talking about um so 41 percent of property taxes go to schools 21 go to cities 70 for 17 percent from counties and 14 from special districts and then a little four percent for community colleges and four percent for urban renewals so we all have a different share but the big point of it though is that the county function one a couple of main county functions are assessment taxation health and human services issues that the county provides in public safety and the fact of the matter is this group of counties isn't meeting those basic functions um and it's that that's what their responsibility is is to do assessment and taxation my studies are all responding with with that's their function um so why why is it they can't pay um well we've heard about the timber changes and just the economies in these districts and we're sympathetic to that but if you look at these four counties that are on that the grade list their permanent rate um josephine county is 59 cents um curry county is 60 cents and these counties have refused to do a local option levy um so that's the hard reality um and that sounds foreign if you on those numbers as well 59 cents and 60 cents so let me tell you what that looks like if you have a 200 000 home um and a 200 000 valued home isn't really going to be taxed on 200 000 mind you because there'll be it'll be an assessed value with a discount of at least 10 percent if not 20 30 or 40 percent let's just say it's it's a 200 000 home at a 60 cents that's 0.06 percent um that's an incredibly low tax rate um your year county bill is 120 so that's that's what these folks are paying under 200 000 house 120 and now they want the cities and the school districts to pay more because the local option levy won't pass to pay their share so that's the problem here is their permanent rate is that low it's not totally the only problem here we do have measure five caps that some areas have hit um we do have the three percent growth limit so even if properties are going up they're not going the assessments are not going up enough so but still 59 cents 60 cents um douglas county is a dollar eleven um and they're only going to go up three percent a year so it's our property tax system that's part of the problem it's the other parts of measure five and fifty that are also part of the problem um in curry county there are only three cities incorporated cities there's lots of little towns but they're not incorporated so they're not paying any other tax besides the county tax and the special districts and school districts the three cities are brookings port orford and gold beach i asked the good assessor did you talk to those three those three cities no what do you think they would say if you were going to now shift it to them they would oppose and why is that well their permanent rates brookings is 376. gold beach is 234. port orford is 227. and curry county's paying 60 cents so if we're going to shift it this is the problem you're going to make the school districts lose money you're going to make the cities lose money um i think the fact of the matter is this needed to be done in a work group like we did last time when we were in a crisis and we agreed to give up our um interest on the delinquencies and we helped work together on that again now this one is taking from schools as well so you're going to have that hole to fill but the cities have stepped up they've passed their local option levees they're paying for their police and fire you'll hear from special districts um and so this just isn't the right solution to take from one taxing entity to another um it's complicated and i appreciate some of the the comments made from department revenue on help some ways um to make it a little better but the other big problem in this bill is that there's no side boards it doesn't say well how do we come up with what's the right budget for this assessment and taxation um it seems to be that the neutral party is the department of revenue but you heard on thursday that these four counties have still met the minimum what was the words minimally adequate system so if we don't think it's good enough we have to say well why isn't it good enough and then what's the gap we need to know that because we can't just say okay these counties are in distress but so what is it that how much more money do they need so that they can do what is what we think is the right amount um we don't have that in this bill um so we need to trigger and we need a neutral convener to figure out what the budget is i think it's already been explained that the way the bill is written um there's no assurance that the county will continue to pay at least what they're they're at now when you look at those columns that lro put together um the counties are actually going to pay less the way it's written with the two percent um they would be responsible for less and said it would be shifted and so that that's um alarming um so in other words we want this to be if we're going to pay this we need to be in addition to what they've got now not as a supplement or even to replace rather a substitute um we have a couple of other ideas that probably perhaps aren't popular but at least it would be fair the state statute provides that if you pay on time on november 15th you get a three percent discount well if these counties are in distress a fair way to make sure everybody pays the same would be to remove that discount to pay for it um that would have paid for the folks in the unincorporated as well as the incorporated not real popular amongst my cities that are in the incorporated but at least it's fair and the unincorporated folks are paying their fair share um that would be not so popular with the commissioners as well but that's frankly where part of the problem is is we're not getting a tax increase um you could do it to the two percent or three percent you can you can um fiddle with that um obviously there's the kaffa fund as well um and that's the history has been explained of how there used to be a general fund paying more towards that kaffa fund um that would be a way for the the state to pay for the school portion of it to increase that area um it's senate bill 5535 is the department of revenue's bill our budget bill and in that presentation they explained all of the kafa program and it it's now at 20 percent that's how much kaffa is paying for counties and i think as gail riddell from the association of morning counties explained the goal originally was for kaffi to pay 35ish percent so perhaps that's something that the the joint ways and means committee can handle i think i said revenue the joint ways and means committee can handle that is chaired by erisa smith is to fix that cafe gap to fill where we haven't been able to to meet the um the need there um we also just are not agreeing with some of the comments about well if you the cities chip in they're going to get it back i've talked to several of our cities and they don't think that will happen because a lot of these omitted properties are in the unincorporated parts um roseburg is the largest city in that county and they don't believe at all that they would make up that their two percent would be um so we're concerned about that um i could go on but um basically it's a complicated issue that's really exacerbated by our measure five and fifty system and this solution of moving it from one taxpayer to another just we don't think is the right solution we agree wholeheartedly with the sponsors that we need to fix because we can't have this broken system continue and not because once you mess up what the assessment is then we're stuck at that forever because that's where your mav is that's not good but that's hurting the general fund for schools it's hurting all the taxing districts but we can't do it the way it is as it's written so with that i'd be happy to take any questions thank you special district good afternoon mr chair members of the committee for the record has seen esquires on behalf of the special districts association of oregon our membership represents 930 special taxing districts throughout the state of oregon there are 31 different types of special districts what we refer to as the big six water fire sewer parks ports and irrigation and then a whole host of other types of taxing districts and as you heard at the last hearing a new type of taxing district a predator control district a very interesting type of district that we're now representing some of our districts are very very um dependent on property tax revenue we don't receive state shared revenue we don't receive liquor we don't receive cigarette so for some districts 95 of their entire budget is made of property tax revenue and those districts are typically rural fire protection districts libraries and a large portion of most parks and recreation districts budgets come from property taxes so tax exemptions and redirecting prop existing property tax revenue to other sources are of great concern to us and our membership we're not gigantic like the cities some cities in some smaller cities we're really some of us are very small 36 percent of our districts have five or fewer ftes and 45 percent of our memberships budgets are 100 000 or less so revenue impacts to them are real especially as it relates to rural fire protection districts as you've already heard we already contribute 25 percent of delinquent of interest off of the delinquent property tax we feel like we gave at the well once with the cities and we are participating in what we believe is a county function it should be funded by counties in addition to the other services that wendy mentioned you know elections is a county service function and we we help fund those already and we do not want to expand that into the assessment and taxation realm i submitted written testimony and i attached a chart of all of the affected taxing districts under this measure in the four counties the members of the uh uh taxing districts listed in yellow are um our members and then the rest are cities or just districts that don't belong to special districts association um as you can see from that sideways list sorry about that from the sideways list there are a lot of rural fire protection districts and i just want to point out one thing that's different about special districts compared to cities and counties we are single service providers so unlike a city where where if there is a budget reduction that needs to take place they get to choose okay we take it out of the library or we do something with the parks we just provide one single service so anything that reduces our revenue affects that one single service that we provide i wanted to make a couple of points based upon mark's comments about potential first of all i just did want to say that that predator predator control district in klamath falls it actually did join our association and it was on the ballot for in may of 16 for eight cents per thousand dollars and they collect a whopping eight dollars per year so it's not surprising to me that they would say sure go ahead and take two percent of our revenue and williams fire district that you heard testified to they um impose a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars total per year in property taxes their budget's 280 thousand dollars a year they have two ftes and one volunteer i'm not surprised that williams fire district said sure go ahead and take two percent of our taxes we kind of have the reverse situation of being really small so two percent really doesn't necessarily affect the super tiny people but we do have some districts that are allowing significant amounts of money like in douglas county douglas county fire district number two which has had some financial problems uh in the last couple of years anyway um so as it relates to the three percent discount i'd be shot on the spot by my membership if i agreed to take the three percent discount so that's a non-starter for us we do agree that there should have been a work group on this uh you know i guess a couple of our districts were reached out to we i mean we we know that these taxes have to be collected in order for our districts to remain afloat but this just doesn't we were not participating in any uh of the work up of this bill and it does not seem that there are any sideboards to this um i'm concerned extremely concerned about changing the number of counties that would qualify for this to 12 counties anybody with a permanent rate of two dollars or less that would increase that would triple four times four times quadruple the number of district counties that would be eligible for this and we wouldn't support that either so wendy's laid out a couple of things um i do support mark garc's attempt if there is a forthcoming amendment to require that there be an enhancement in assessment and taxation uh generated revenue in order for you to get the two percent if that's what you end up doing there should be some sort of provision that says you are going to do more and you're going to get more if we give you this two percent rather than just maintain the status quo so with that i'd be happy to answer any questions thank you very much questions i think we're going to await the view of the amendments oh representative marsh did you have something i do have a question thank you um i i am thank you chair um do you do you think there's a potential for some local conversations around this when we talk about work group it's always up at this level but i think the i think the the good intention of this bill what is to recognize that we have at the local level common constituencies um overlapping goals um and the opportunity to really look at the struggles and that's everybody has a piece of and figure out a way to do it more efficiently and maybe to make that pot girl grow in the process so i'm just wondering if those kind of conversations instead of starting at this level and going down could start at the local level and bubble up in terms of what we hear from local communities that's great chair barnard representative marsh um it's actually one of my points that i just didn't make is that each one of these four counties that's on the list has a very different fiscal story and just the geography and their finances and their economies are very different um and so it is awkward to do state policy because the reasons that they're in the situation they're at and and how they could work together um is just different as a local solution would probably be a better solution than trying to come up with a scheme of a formula here and so those conversations just haven't happened um in in the interim and in fact you know we were allegedly this bill was not going forward and that could we would continue to work on this issue of assessment taxation in the next in the next year um so it was a surprise that this came out this way um because we recognize it's a problem but we also recognize we really need property tax reform um which would fix a lot of this mess um so that's sort of the chicken and egg but we would prefer a local fix and some leadership there chair barn or representative marsh um and i just like to say that i think that in some ways this actually was a bit of a local initiative as wendy said you know this wasn't brought by the assessors association overall this certainly wasn't a department of revenue initiative so i think that this is what some assessors down in southern oregon district one they had worked together on this project and they were grappling with how they were going to fund their assessment taxation going forward and this was the idea that they came up with so this was their this was their local solution but you know i certainly think that ongoing conversations could happen so thank you very much appreciate your testimony i think oh oh we have one more please come forward oh no i hadn't forgotten me but i thought maybe you had no it's crap welcome back thank you chair barnard members of the committee douglas schmidt polk county assessor testifying for the oregon state association of county assessors and we are neutral on this bill you heard testimony last week from assessors that were in favor of this bill and we don't stand against their position but as an association we we determined that we would stay neutral we do believe that there's a need for stable funding for assessment and taxation purposes the is this bill the solution i don't know it could be a part of it there's probably some other options out there too some of them have been brought up so i think that what was discussed was you know having a work group or some local discussion is probably going to be a good thing to see if we can resolve some of this um i this is this is not there has been some not by not by the people here but some written testimony that was submitted said it was partly a because of some bad management and stuff that they can't do their job and and that's not the case it's a function of of the tax law we work under because the because of the um property taxes the fixed the permanent rate the counties that are in trouble right now were the ones that had significant uh reliance on onc and when that went away they couldn't change their rate and i'm not sure that that is the fact with the cities i'm not sure the city's received any onc money and so their permanent rate is their permanent rate it's what they were levying growing it growing at three percent plus whatever value increase there is so a couple things i would like to mention is that uh it seems like almost every legislative session we see more and more work asked of assessors offices with no or minimal additional funding provided this session alone there are bills that would expand the assessor's lien collection responsibility for cities trying to collect on energy efficiency loans districts want to ex and by the way representative marsh and i've talked about that one and there is a funding mechanism in that so i want to just admit that districts want to exempt more single unit housing for low-income families their seismic upgrade bills being supported by cities that will require assessors to track upgraded costs against tax cut exemptions cities are asking to have their city boundary be the area for the change property ratio districts are asking to collect taxes on exempt property and to be allowed to reduce their assessment value on property none of these bills except for the one that i mentioned have any revenue offset or funding mechanism for assessment taxations taxation senior citizen advocates want to freeze the taxes on seniors homes veterans advocates want to exempt more value from veterans houses cannabis beer and liquor equipment could be exempt as food processing we will have to send out additional forms for pert business personal property reporting assessors levy and collect taxes for the oregon department of forestry but a few years ago when assessors asked them to pay an administration fee through a bill we requested we were shut down when counties asked the legislators legislature several years ago for an increase in the recording fee for kaffa we will we were shuffled down because affordable housing advocates by affordable housing advocates because they wanted a recording fee to fund affordable housing now affordable housing advocates are asking for a recording fee to increase from twenty dollars per recording to forty dollars per recording taxing districts feel may be rightly so that if a county can't get a local option passed to provide more services to taxpayers why should the districts pay 2 percent of their revenue to fund assessment and taxation i ask instead that assessors work with our own counties cities and districts to find a resolution to this problem improperly staffed assessors offices could have an impact on all districts not just the county and i think you saw some of that in what the the assessor in curry county testified on about the additional revenue that was generated because he had done some inspections the question was asked or maybe it wasn't asked but implied that there would be additional revenue captured if this funding was provided as a poll county assessor i can't guarantee that i am one of the onc counties i am one of the distressed counties but i believe that my office has run very efficiently and i am not sure that we would find a significant amount of property that was not on the tax roll to offset the increase so there is that issue of guaranteeing that the additional funding would provide additional revenue if you have any questions i'd be happy to try and answer them for you thank you questions well we've learned how to testify here no questions thank you very much thank you and with that we'll uh uh close the public hearing in house bill 2363. colleagues i just wanted to let you know that uh we are uh moving to another day not yet decided uh the work sessions uh for that were scheduled for tomorrow for house bill 2203 2204 and 22.70 i would also note that some of you have yet to return your comments on the property tax exemption sunsets on house bill 2859 it would be useful to have those we plan to have another conversation about those uh about that uh bill uh tomorrow and uh those who would prefer to be on a work group uh working on this issue might simply not respond to the my request for emails and that would improve the odds of your being on the work group anything else for the committee today i'm sorry i can't i can't help it sometimes without the committee is adjourned see you tomorrow
yLXAxM-Kvqo,NJ,02-22-2016,in the united states again good morning uh we have uh this is our first hearing of the uh what legislature number are we 200 and what 800 something oh well anyway 217 first hearing of the health committee senior services committee for two for the legislature number 217 welcome everyone we have um welcome especially to something to the public uh but to our uh new members uh mr kennedy ms mcknight mr croach and uh mr peasy i look forward to your to your service on this committee and to your input as we move forward and mr frankie called the roll thank you assemblywoman chapissi is present assemblyman peterson assemblywoman munoz assemblywoman to crouch assemblywoman sumpter assemblywoman thinking assemblywoman mcknight assemblyman kennedy assemblywoman jimenez assemblyman green uh someone benson vice chairman eustace chairman conaway here a quorum is present and thank you to uh to our incumbent members too i was wondering what that little cross-side look was so nice to see so many of you back and uh and here i guess our committee's expanded too well you certainly uh we're going into this room and um welcome uh to our new vice chairman mr eustis and thanks to mr benson for his very able service uh in that role uh just uh prior to uh mr eustace taking up the post so we do uh we have an agenda that i think we can get through with some [Music] ease i hope today we do have a hearing on lead that will follow the bills today which which obviously speaks to a matter of great import nationally and which i think is deserving of this committee's cognizance moving forward um so that we might decide along with our other colleagues uh whether or not any changes uh need to be made in new jersey with respect to to water quality with that where's my list let's first take up uh and this is for discussion only by the way i will not be voting this bill out of committee today i don't see hey hey what was he is he here i haven't seen him um a 1042 lan andrews act establishes minimum fees for providing copies of patient medical records uh [Applause] well we'll start with sarah goldstein esquire mro corporation uh who was opposed now i notice there are uh uh a few other uh people who are opposed this i would um and but who don't want to offer testimony i would actually like uh you to reconsider that and take a few moments um of course uh his ghost team might have the whole thing knocked out but uh please if there's something that uh for those in opposition that ms goldstein happens not to mention uh those who have mentioned that they have an interest in opposition i would want you to come up and uh and enlighten us as to your views um chance mr lykins uh you want to introduce your guest thank you chairman and uh thank you to the members of the committee my name is chance lykins with mbi gluck shaw i'm here on today on behalf of both healthport and mro and sarah with me is with mro they are what we call release of information companies and what they do they contract with hospitals and physician practices to take up the business of uh distributing health records and excuse me this uh there are a lot of steps that go into this and and so while respectfully we're here in opposition today i think the intent the sponsor's intent on this legislation is a good one and one that we support as far as making sure both people of lesser means and even just regular patients are not paying a bunch of money for their records and and i want to make it clear we don't think that's happening today i think as a patient trying to continue your care getting your record often comes at no cost at all but certainly we support the provisions in this bill um with the 250 poverty level where there's never any cost the real crux of this issue for us and what this bill does not do is separate the third party requesters and that is generally a legally authorized representative generally an attorney who is seeking that record often for a lawsuit whether it's through the hospital or the physician and the office of civil rights has said the third party requester is not the patient and we think any legislation done here in new jersey should make that same stipulation um so with that i'm going to turn you over to the expert sarah goldstein from mro and let her take over good morning and thank you for having me and thank you for holding the bill so that we can continue working with the sponsors of the bill and the other affected stakeholders so that we can focus on access to medical records and not just the issue of cost mro works with approximately 140 hospitals and clinics in the state of new jersey helping them with their release of information processing meaning processing requests for copies of medical records we work with these health care providers and we lower the operating costs for them by providing highly trained staff who are familiar with hipaa and other related medical privacy laws so that there are the compliant release of information we are asking um to continue to work with the sponsors on this because the bill as it stands today does not differentiate between the labor and time involved with processing third-party requests for medical records as opposed to patient requests for medical records under hipaa patients can submit a written uh request for all um excuse me a written request for copies of their medical records and under hipaa health care providers can only charge a reasonable cost-based fee for those records that reasonable cost-based fee cannot include the cost associated for searching and compiling for those records it's only related to supplies and to labor directly associated with putting those records together under hipaa a third-party request for medical records must be accompanied by an authorization and that authorization must include core elements and required statements under hipaa there's much more work involved in processing a third-party request for medical records because there are multiple pieces of information that needs to be provided on that authorization to make sure that the patient did indeed understand their rights under hipaa and understand what they were permitting to be disclosed one of the materials that we provided today is a workflow which includes approximately 45 steps involved in processing a third party's request for medical records those steps are not involved in processing a patient's request for copies of medical records again because they do not have to submit this authorization hipaa is all about promoting access to copies of medical records for patients and protecting their privacy under the bill and the maximum fees they would apply those maximum fees to all types of requests and it doesn't take into account the fact that patient requests involve less work than let's say a third party request for medical records and because there be more there'd be less availability to receive reimbursement for the time and labor spent processing third party requests for copies of medical records health healthcare providers would need to allocate additional funds that they're not currently doing in order to subsidize their medical records departments to process these third-party requests so i thank you again for not taking this bill to a vote today and for allowing us more time to work with the sponsors and with the affected stakeholders thank you well um any questions for uh ms goldstein i did wonder so so if i understand your argument uh this is the information provided as respects the sort of steps that need to be taken with respect to third party requests why wouldn't why wouldn't to simplify things these steps be followed in every case i mean is there a lot of i mean protecting sensitive information seems like you'd always have to do that retrieving patient protective health information seems like you'd have to do that in any case make sure the proper authorizations are obtained uh you know i'm not sure how much protection we need to give to individuals if they requested their record you know folks are adults you know and and and sign um and authorize people to do things all the time whether it be getting a loan for a house or a car or any number of services where um there might be sensitive information involved i i'm i'm i have to say i'm surprised that the that um that's a much more complicated issue just because the third parties requested information it is correct and and part of the reason why it's more complicated is because of the requirements under hipaa for health care providers so there are rules that do not apply to patient requests so there is a concept called the minimum necessary rule under hipaa and the minimum necessary rule means that if a third party is requesting copies of medical records you can only give them the minimum necessary information so particular dates of service particular types of medical records with patient requests that rule does not apply the patient is entitled to they can just say please provide me any and all medical records and then you can provide those records there's not this concern about minimum necessary the over disclosure of records because again they are going to the patient so in addition to the authorization requirement within the authorization there are several required statements one in informs a patient of how they would revoke their authorization another statement states that the health care provider cannot condition treatment for that patient patient or payment for that patient's care based upon them signing this authorization and there's also um lying information that's required related to an expiration date for that authorization so hipaa adds more requirements when a third party is requesting those records as opposed to when a patient themselves requests copies of those records um yes mr crush i have one question because you mentioned labor and time um and when i think of oprah and you're talking about certain information third party um the provider the person i'd be giving the information to them has to redact is that what you're talking like under oprah they have to take certain things out which is going to take them a lot of time and labor to give the document to the third party versus the patient so it really depends on what a hospital's policy is um most of our clients will not redact records because there's a lot of liability associated with that so let's say a third party were requesting copies of medical records for someone and let's say they contained protected information such as psychotherapy notes or information related to substance and alcohol treatment we would request that a specific type of authorization that the patient explicitly expresses that they are authorizing this type of sensitive information to be disclosed so that's involved with it also from time to time there are subpoenas and court orders that come along and if they're requesting sensitive information there are additional steps that need to be taken in terms of redacting that can be something that does come up depending on the client and their policies and another thing that contributes to the labor and time is now that medical records are both stored on paper and electronically and within the electronic system each provider may have their own different form of an electronic health record it's not as easy as just clicking one button you have to go into each system and making sure that you're getting the appropriate information for the appropriate patient based on what's being requested you did mention uh about the mental health records and i just have to be reviewing this the other day for uh thinking about you know the addiction crisis and and the stigma around uh mental health care and the like and i believe new jersey's law under new jersey's law uh the patient is allowed to request the release of those records without um any a particular um contingencies being placed on states very um uh indiana's one and some of these other states where you have to you know make some specific requests or have you know specific rights around but new jersey's sort of wide open on this i mean i don't know when you mentioned this about the mental health records if i'm authorizing a record to go um you know the whole record goes because it is one person we're talking about whether it be their mental or physical health um now patients do have the right now you're saying under this that we will inform the patient that they have a right perhaps not to release all the record they could do a they can if they choose to uh release all the record but mental health records if they wish is that correct and um the state doesn't require you to do that does it is that a requirement of the state is it a requirement of the state that the patient explicitly authorizes to really so um of mental health currently in new jersey the only thing that a patient would have to explicitly authorize would be the psychotherapy notes or any records written by a psychotherapist those require special authorization but any sort of inpatient mental health treatment records or outpatient mental health treatment records not associated with these types of notes you don't need to explicitly authorize that but i am under the understanding that there will be a change in the law come in june or july of 2016 based on some information from a client of ours in south jersey okay okay has this law already been passed um i have the citation i don't remember it i've been sitting around here a long time i think i would remember that from what i understand it's going to be more protective of this type of information so patients privacy um they need to be more aware of how their records are going to be disclosed and more explicit authorization that's a proposal you say um i would actually be i have on my desk in my office the actual citation to what i've been told is is coming along in either june or july of this year and i'd be happy to provide that to you i very much appreciate you sending that forward you don't have that either okay interesting well any other um anyone else have questions from his ghost team thank you chairman if i can just i want to add one more thing um before we left here because while we had concerns with this legislation we do view today as an opportunity this is an issue that we've proactively been working on for a couple of years and i didn't say in the beginning there are two regulations that deal with this the department of health has one concerning hospitals and the board of medical examiners have the other that deals with physician practices neither of those have been brought up to date to reflect our current medical practice and electronic records are not addressed in them and so what we've seen in other states are lawsuits put together where a plaintiff says my records should have cost less because they were electronic instead of paper and so before i left i i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't point out paper and ink is not what the cost of these records you have that chart with the 45 steps regardless of the format the work to make sure that the right patient gets the right record it doesn't vary based on the format so just before i left i had to make sure i pointed that out there is legislation that addresses this issue in a broader a broader way which we do support we think this issue does need to be addressed as we're moving towards electronic health records we need to make sure we we take care of this and that's it thank you very much great thank you mr pizza quick question just to mr michael yeah uh to confirm you guys have absolutely no issues with patients receiving records under this for a continuation of care purposes for indigent people receiving it it's just the unduly burdensome requests for litigation type of things that we've all seen at times that is correct that is correct um we worked with legal services on another piece of legislation and the language in in this bill we're talking about today i think mirrors that as far as the the poverty level and those things um yes we we do not want it to be cost prohibitive for anyone whether they're poor or people of means to continue their care that in most circumstances i don't i don't want to be wrong and misquote but in most circumstances that is not a cost a patient would bear if you were at the hospital getting records to continue your care so no we we support that provision in this bill completely it's just that the bill does not separate this this third-party requesters um and that that is an issue on a third-party request requester you would be okay with including situations where somebody had a conservative it was unable to make a decision for themselves so it was a family member somebody who was doing it on their behalf still being included in this for part of the continuum of care it's just the outside stuff yes technically under um hipaa if a let's say a healthcare power of attorney or next of kin or somebody authorized under state law to act on behalf of the patient and making health care decisions that would still be considered a patient request and would be subject to either the reasonable cost based fee under hipaa or if it's for continuation of care there would be no charge and sorry one more point um in our written testimony which you have i think we said 142 hospitals we we met contracts with hospitals because various radiation or surgery you know different wings have may have a different contract with the provider but in in the current market most hospitals do not pay for the service at all um a company like mro will contract with them for the right to service those records and they make their money from basically from these third-party requesters and so right now is a very good relationship we have with hospitals and with physician practices which if caps and you know and certain limits were put on cost that relationship could change over time so right now um that is a good relationship that does not cost the hospitals any money very good thanks uh i will note that uh lori clark new jersey association of osteopathic physicians as opposed no need to testify um um chancellorkins we just with the mbi gluckshaw health court just heard from him opposed no need to testify or i guess he did testify actually pardon me neil eicher new jersey hospital association opposed me to testify and michelle is on medical side new jersey opposed and i need to testify so we have some appear we have some work to do on this legislation and we'll advise the sponsor of that and we will see what we see going forward next we'll take up a 2106 um mukherjee from its homeless to receive certified copy of birth certificate without a fee oh do we check it no this is no one oh no one has um signed up uh to testify for or against this legislation uh i would for the education of the committee uh as i understand it this bill uh generates from uh issues that um homeless people often face in accessing services they don't have often without any documentation which will allow them either to be identified so they can begin to recover their lives uh through the help of social service agencies our social support system and a birth certificate is often the first the start of getting that process underway and this bill uh designed to to ease that i understand that there are some concerns that the government has raised with respect to it and so there will be some modifications to the bill as it makes its way through but i'd ask for a vote today so we can get that process going uh mr benson uh and uh ms sumter mr frankie call the rule on the motion to report assembly bill 2106 assemblywoman chapisi provided uh that some of the security concerns uh get um addressed i'll vote in favor of it assemblyman peterson yes assemblywoman munoz yes assemblywoman to crook yes assemblywoman sumpter assemblywoman pinken assemblywoman mcknight assemblyman kennedy assemblywoman jimenez assemblyman green assemblyman benson vice chairman eustis chairman conway yes the bill is reported thank you committee next we'll uh take up a2320 uh venery huddle conway raises minimum age for purchase and sales tobacco products and electronic smoking devices from 19 to 21. this bill uh has been heard in this committee not too long ago and passed with a very strong support and also passed both houses of the legislature uh and so i don't i think the issues on this piece of legislation are pretty clear um and so while i appreciate uh all those who wish to come up i hope that respective time you'll keep your comments and support um uh brief and uh we'll move forward and get this bill out and make it get it on its way and see if we can't do a better job of of getting it through the passage um mr david henry new jersey association of county city health officials in favor daniel is that kings or kenny a king oh that's a g is all right just two minutes good morning mr chairman and committee members my name is dave henry i'm the legislative chair for the new jersey association of county and city health officials um we've been on record before that we enthusiastically support um this legislation and we hope it passes again um currently there's 14 municipalities that have adopted local ordinances to raise the age of smoking to 21 and that has gone very well but we feel that state legislation would be more consistent across the state actually and again in order to keep my comments brief um we again support this uh very wholeheartedly and uh ask for uh uh um ask that it be passed thank you good morning my name is danielle king i'm an undergrad and graduate student at rutgers university i'm majoring in public health has health education and behavioral science um i am also a veteran and i served in the marine corps and deployed to afghanistan in 2009 through 2010. what encouraged me to speak today was the previous concern brought up in the senate committee two weeks ago which was the concern that military members should be allowed to smoke considering they were able to sign up for war we have an extreme duty to protect military members just like we raised the drinking age to 21 it is also equally important to raise the smoking age to 21. currently in the marine corps 30 percent of marine smoke in the army 26 smoke the institute of medicine conducted a study and found that um smoking reduces physical performance capacity lowered visual acuity and also resulted in poor night vision than non-smokers even the slightest effect on a person in combat can make the difference of life or death a recent tricare study shows that the rate of lung cancer in veterans may be as high as twice the rate of lung cancer in civilians costing the va and a low estimate of 1 billion a year even though smoking in the general population has decreased it has been steady in the military which has prompted military officials to try and figure out ways to reduce smoking this bill of raising the age of 21 could prevent 223 000 premature deaths to americans among among the born between the age of 2000 and 2019 according to the institute of medicine among those who could be saved from premature deaths will be those who served it is our duty to to protect veterans and make sure that the that the life they have after serving isn't in a hospital bed fighting lung cancer here today we have the opportunity to prevent people from smoking at a young age and prevent addiction thank you for your time well thank you ms king for bringing this this testimony before the panel it is an issue that has been raised and um i think you very eloquently spoke to it uh having served the military myself and you know everybody who serves uh what do we say we're the property of the federal government and we we follow orders some better than others and uh and so uh you know those who are in the service will um if you're not if you're not supposed to drink then you then you will not drink if you're not supposed to smoke then you're not gonna smoke so uh in the past of course we had we didn't know how dangerous smoking was and and smoking was used to deliver uh you know nicotine to help with appetite to help with study nerves focus the mind there are positive benefits actually to nicotine which um which ought to be said i guess but uh the the the detriments the um the negative side effects are so great and so overwhelming and we know that once that hook gets placed uh into a person at a young age that far too many will go on to smoke their entire lives and will die prematurely from uh from smoking so um perhaps it's more important than ever to make sure these rules are applied across our services to protect the many uh men and women who serve who serve there we want them around for a good time to come and preventing and getting them a little older to prevent them from smoking we'll um we'll go a long way to ensuring that that's so thank you uh next we're going to bring up um oh any questions i'm sorry mr green first of all i want to congratulate you on your testimony and also i do support what we're trying to accomplish but i would like to you gave us percentages of basically uh what's going on with the different branches of government i guess my concern is that have there been any pushback in terms of individuals saying i'm old enough to go to war but now you're telling me that i'm too young to be able to smoke what's the feeling among the people in the service when it comes down to the feeling their rights are violated i live in a world where i see so much no matter when you're helping a person you're doing the right thing for a person you're going to get that negative impact and i would just like to want to be in a position so that when i mention what percentage do smoke don't smoke and how do they feel in general about this particular issue is it being accepted because we're trying to do the best thing we can to help them with their health or is it being challenged there definitely is a challenge a lot of smokers feel very strongly about being able to smoke but at the same time there's proof that a lot of military members are trying to quit i think it's around 52 percent of those who do smoke have tried to stop quitting so i think if we can stop them from smoking at 21 before 21 that it would be in their best interest so in my opinion it doesn't really matter that they feel like oh i should smoke oh i should smoke it's more about what is good for their health and i feel like we have the opportunity to to help a person before they become addicted saying or how you feel about the issue in general so i think once we pass the law is it a way that once we start to educate them that we can win them over or they feel like their rights are being violated because you have some that's just against wars let's go back 50 years now against anything that we feel is the right thing to do but so many people nowadays feel that rights are being violated there's a person who's going to support this i like to be able to respond in a positive way other than we're telling you what's good for your body oh something i would just mention that you know we're trying to do something in the interest of public health and to promote long-term quality of health and prevent bad outcomes down the road i think what happens is in collaboration with a number of different parties and organizations i think it'll become more normal as time goes on that that we've raised or potentially raised the age of of uh tobacco purchasing but you know it's not only enforcement but it's health education it's health promotion you know in in so that people become normalized to this um i don't want to belabor too much time but i remember going to um bowling alleys where they used to be smoke-filled and then the smoke the smoke-free air act came around and now you know the bowling alleys were concerned that they would be affected economically but now i see parties on saturdays sundays it's a whole big family affair so i think what happens is you know it's not like we're trying to be big government we're just trying to uh provide an alternative to have people live healthier lives for a longer period of time thank you we're going to bring up i appreciate your testimony karen blumenfeld new jersey gasp uh maureen weber uh have a point of care is that that bell oh that's two t's a habit point of care amy barclay campaign for tobacco-free kids okay says 23.20 on here well come up for that bill it's got the right i guess rom um got the wrong bill number on there then ms bloom and fell two minutes it's good yes it's good i always get mislead when it's red which means no my mind as opposed to green um good morning everyone my name is karen blumenfeld i'm the executive director of the nonprofit global advisors on smoke free policy and i want to thank you chairman chairman um as well as the committee members that are here today that were supportive of the bill last term and again thank you again for being supportive of it um in this legislative session um our expertise is pretty wide when it comes to tobacco 21. one of the things that we do is we provide educational resources to the communities around the state of new jersey that want to do 21 on their own and just to share with you 16 towns in the state have done tobacco 21 and many more are in the process of doing it so there's definitely that grassroots local momentum to have this happen and as i go to town council meetings and board of health meetings on this i just want to share with you that i've really witnessed firsthand an enthusiasm and a commitment by local policy makers uh to try and help their town's young people not to start smoking and help people quit um and because of this many of them have passed their own local ordinances um hoping that it would be the impetus for the state to move forward on a statewide level um now sometimes have decided to wait um and so we're very thankful again that you all are looking at this initiative early on the legislative session and that it's already passed on the senate health committee side as well just a couple of things i want to share policies that reduce teen and young adults access to tobacco have been shown to lower smoking initiation rates and it's obvious that less tobacco use will translate into lowered smoking-related healthcare costs it's obvious that um in new jersey we spend three billion dollars a year in smoking related health care costs so an initiative like this which is uh has virtually no cost whatsoever except for most likely putting up signs is something that can definitely help last year a federal study showed that 250 000 lies would be saved if tobacco were raised for sale to age 21 and older and that's why the new jersey chapter of the american college of physicians as well as their national organization and the american medical association also support this a note on e-cigarettes it's not a footnote i can't say anymore because this last year's study showed that a triple increase in young people using electronic smoking devices we're glad to see that it's continuing to be in this particular bill because as i noted the increased use in youth using these products plus there's no marketing or advertising restrictions uh on e-cigarettes new jersey was the first first date to ban the use of electronic smoking devices back in 2010 so we're proud of that and we're also proud of new jersey for last year um our last session um passing the the law that requires child resistant packaging um thank you to um assault women pink and for that and others that were involved there's also peer-reviewed studies that conclude electronic smoking devices not only hazardous to the people that use them but hazardous to innocent bystanders that breathe in the air so the bottom line is that tobacco 21 initiatives they do reduce smoking they do improve health outcomes and they will save taxpayer dollars and i just have one quick question uh about the bill if i may um because there are communities that are passing this policy i just have a question to confirm that the bill does not preempt local towns from doing these types of policies if it were to pass just like the smoke-free air act has a no preemption clause in it that allows towns to do more we wanted to ask the question uh about to confirm whether or not that unless hasn't been thought about yet but um we would prefer that there be clarity when it comes to no preemption just because of the history of new jersey with always starting on the local level and then moving to the state level and thanking those that have been the forerunners um in this particular area thank you well as i understand the bill it does will preempt state law general and you know when there's an overlap we'll prevent local ordinances and as i understand it that's the case here but the goal has been accomplished in any case and hopefully people can still if they want credit um can take a healthy chunk of responsibility for getting state to do the right thing so let's focus on the positive thank you thank you chairman conaway i'm amy barclay i'm with the campaign for tobacco-free how's that okay i'm amy barkley i'm with the campaign for tobacco-free kids and we're based in washington dc we're a national organization that monitors tobacco prevention policy change and supports that change in all the states throughout the country and i just want to make one point because karen made the case uh very well for the for the bill itself but i wanted to let you know that really the eyes of the public health community nationally are on new jersey those of you who served the state for a while know that historically new jersey's been a leader in tobacco prevention efforts and unfortunately now has the dubious distinction of being the only state that's not using tobacco-related revenues to fund tobacco prevention and cessation and consequently you know progress on youth smoking is stalling somewhat so we'd like to see new jersey return to its leadership position and become the second state after hawaii to pass this legislation to raise the age of sale for tobacco to 21. and thanks to those of you who have supported this legislation before thank you we're going to move on uh next well just note that mr lykins representing the march of dimes is in favor no need to testify michelle is on medical side of new jersey in favor of need to testify mrs orlando american heart association in favor and i need to testify a deborah brown american lung association in favor of to testify even hasbro american cancer society whose testimony has been submitted in favor and i need to testify in noah uh new jersey society for respiratory care and favor no need to testify uh diane litterer uh new jersey prevention network in favor and i need to testify libby vinson and new jersey ymca state alliance in favor no need to testify uh sal ris salvato new jersey gasoline and convenience store association opposed mister mr chairman you need to testify uh mary allen papard new jersey food council opposed no need to testify uh rich levesque new jersey vapor retailers coalition um opposed and i need to testify actually i'd like to hear from rich but we have um maybe some other time john holland new jersey retail merchant's association uh opposed uh no need to testify uh anyone else on this legislation that i perhaps missed i'll entertain a motion on this uh bill i'm just useless miss some uh mr stumpter uh mr frankie called the rule on the motion to report assembly bill two three two zero assemblywoman pc um come on i and this is gonna actually surprise some people in my vote but um i'm very consistent on if you're old enough to essentially do everything um i i don't like picking and choosing and saying even i mean i'm somebody who would lower the drinking age so on this i'm gonna know some lumen peterson look i don't advocate for smoking never spoke myself never have any intention of smoke but um like holly i think we have to have some consistency when somebody's an adult can make adult decisions either they're an adult at 18 or 19 or 20 or 21 it used to be a time in this country that 21 was when you became an adult we changed that because people could sign up and go fight in a war make the ultimate sacrifice at 18. so we changed everything 18 and now we're slowly coming back to 21 on everything and i think maybe that's where it should be 21 for everything and if smoking is so bad maybe we should just outlaw tobacco and we should stop talking in this legislature about legalizing marijuana which is no better so we should be consistent we send a message to our children when we say don't smoke but we're going to legalize marijuana we send them this conflicting message and kids are smart and i've been at a dare ceremony where a ten-year-old asked that question it's legal in colorado why isn't it why why is it bad why can't you smoke they asked that question we need to be consistent so i hope that this body if you really think tobacco is that bad and it is against we should be against legalizing marijuana as well because well that's another bill and i've provided some too but on that i'm going to be consistent and vote now okay look forward to your bill to raise the adulthood the age of adulthood 21. that might not actually be a bad idea i'm going to be consistent and vote yes and uh marijuana in these other states is consumed by gummy bears so we have to be careful about legalizing marijuana because i agree with eric on that is that there's that up for vote today i don't know i know but i'm being consistent i want to get on voting yes i i there you go yes i'm voting yes let's go that's your dub summary woman to crouch there you go assemblywoman sumpter chairman i'm going to hold my peace and just vote yes assemblywoman thinking assemblywoman mcknight solomon kennedy assemblywoman jimenez assemblyman green i'm voting yes but i would like to make a statement in terms of my position on this particular issue one i'm going to support it because i feel that we should educate the young people and we should be able to look out for people health who don't look up their own health but again we need to be consistent in terms of people rights so my reasoning for wanting to put it on record is that if we're going to basically say what's good and what's bad then we have to take a stand when we talk about people rights in general so that's my reason for voting the way i'm voting someone benson vice chairman eustace i'm going to vote yes but i agree with some of my colleagues about the age of people being able to serve in the military and making rules about what they can do about what their age of adulthood is i do think that we should spend more money on smoking cessation programs and that should come out of the tobacco revenues and i think that would be a better direction to go i think any way to reduce habitual problems is a great way to go i'm just not a fan of assigning ages to it and uh to assemblyman peterson i hope you feel that way about booze it costs us a lot of money federally and state wise to take care of problems created by alcohol addiction thank you you don't need to respond to that now we we have that's been said about this question of age and i'm just going to say if i would invite members of this committee and members of the public to uh to bring to our attention uh the um the various pros and cons of raising uh the age of majority uh to 21. i think you do make a good point about consistency there although you know you have you know governments are frequently inconsistent and you can uh and they are rather easily explained with legitimacy of war needing to have you know well and able-bodied people uh serving in the military that might might particularly given the control environment uh the command control structure within the military that might um you know it's a very different thing uh from freely entering into a contract by a house to do other things i think i think there are distinctions there which are important where the military is concerned which really in my mind don't make the military unique and really not critical to decisions on this issue so i would say yes happily and thank this committee for their time and let's hope we can get this this ball past the line this time and the bill is reported next we'll take up a 2332 benson s 976 gordon beck requires public health council to promulgate rules and regulations for the use of quality control programs and bioanalytical and clinical laboratories mr benson comments on this this past last term again the goal here this bill is to update department regulations to allow a whole host of testing that's done on a regular basis and allowed to be done with fewer regulations because of the near the the certainty of uh of no errors or if there was an error there is no harm to the patient these are already approved at the federal level this is just getting the state to approve to promulgate new regulations to expand the very smallest they currently have to now match what's at the federal level this reduces costs obviously for patients it also provides greater access for these testing in greater locations great uh we have ms maureen weber in favor ms webber representing abbott point of care thank you chairman and thank you to the committee for allowing me to be here today and to speak in favor of this bill i feel very strongly um that this will help health care in the state and it will also have some focus on reduced cost for health care in the state i do work for abbott point of care evident point of care is a vendor of laboratory testing devices the type of device that we provide is one that's brought to the patient it's brought to the point of care and it offers both waived laboratory tests which are these simple tests that the fda has said are so easy to perform that the likelihood of getting an erroneous result is negligible and also moderate complexity test and i bring that up just so that you're aware in the state we can't even sell our instrument because the state only recognizes eight wave tests these tests were from an old version of federal regulation and the state has not kept in pace with that federal regulation the state has a clinical laboratory improvement act that is from 1975 and they have not updated that it's based on an old federal act from 1967 so we've had conversations with the department of health and ask have they increased their ability to revise the requirements for the state have they made any efforts on that for years we've heard that they're making efforts on this well in looking at why it might be a challenge they're basing an old act on an old federal act in order for them to be able to change the requirements we need to change the fact that now clia 94 clinical laboratory improvement amendments um have come out and been amended since that time and that's what they need to be focusing on that version so that made it challenging for the department um also they have a bio analytical laboratory and laboratory directors act that's from 1953 so again the focus of this bill is to move forward with federal legislation which the majority of other states utilize the majority of other accrediting organizations also have to use that for laboratories as well as their basis or foundation for quality of testing for wave testing and for other requirements this bill does focus also on quality control testing and the reason for that is the way that the requirements are written in the state again they're based on this old federal requirement it doesn't take into account advents that have been made in technology that look at electronic or procedural controls that can be utilized and in utilizing those it reduces cost for quality control testing and it also reduces time for testing of those laboratory devices it also looks at the wave testing again i had said before there are only eight wave tests recognized in the state of new jersey and this is because of an old piece of legislation federally there are hundreds over a hundred tests that are available for laboratories to be able to use but not in the state of new jersey i'll tell you where this really hits my heart i think about long-term care facilities about extended care facilities about facilities with senior citizens and they have a change in their health care condition and the physician is caring for them doesn't have the piece of data to know exactly what's going on with that patient what they oftentimes will want is a piece of laboratory data to be able to make a decision and what they do is they'll have a courier come collect a sample send the sample off to a reference laboratory because they can't afford to have a laboratory in their own facility that would perform these type of tests and they have to wait it might be four hours it might be eight hours and in the meantime the patient's condition can either deteriorate may maintain the same and what they'll do is they'll treat the patient on site the best they can they end up moving that patient to an emergency department where they'll decide what to do with that patient probably repeat those same laboratory tests if the results haven't been back yet and then readmit the patient back to that facility that 450 or 500 ambulance ride is unnecessary the patient probably is confused with being moved from one local to another and certainly they didn't get the care that they could have had in the facility where they're at because they couldn't get wave testing done in that facility things as simple as electrolyte testing that would give them a clue as to whether or not the patient is significantly dehydrated tests that could be done to help them to determine if there's a strep outbreak in that type of facility these are wave tests in other states they're not weighed in the state of new jersey and then lastly there's a piece of legislation that also concerns personnel and the oversight of those personnel we're asking here that the personnel regulations be in concert with the federal regulations and not back from 1953 when this act was put in place the bioanalytical laboratory and laboratory directors act that's primarily what i wanted to say but if there were questions i would love to be able to have a dialogue well i would ask because it you know people have called in the office and advanced this bill and uh and uh uh i generally certainly support it i would be curious to know however um there's a phrase there and i generally agree with harmonization between state and federal law but often states will have more stringent requirements to deal with particular health and safety concerns of the state and so and in our federal system states very typically we'll have you know regulations that go beyond the federal regulation because the federal regulation could only pass a sort of a watered down version of whatever it is they're trying to do and states um you know being laboratories for democracy and other and other ideas uh can go beyond that uh when they feel it's in the best interest of their people this um uh this bill will it generally raise or lower standards of that are designed to protect the health and safety here in new jersey sure so i i would say in my opinion particularly with the quality control piece that would actually raise the standards right now the way that it's written in the requirements in the state laboratories would be forced to test liquid quality control on a routine basis on the federal side they actually have something that allows the laboratorian to look at the testing process from start to finish look at the risks that are in that process and write an individualized quality control plan based on those risks and it depends on the test complexity there's three levels of the lowest level being this wave testing moderate and high complexity but these moderate complexity tests they would be able to write a more comprehensive quality control plan under that requirement that's on the federal side in terms of the personnel requirements um it depends on you know which type of testing you're talking about but some of the requirements are really too stringent in the state we don't have enough laboratories that meet the requirements that are written in the state requirements to be able to perform wave testing under that individual for the bioanalytical laboratory director so making it so stringent that you can't perform these type of tests in the locations where they need to perform be performed is not in the best interest of health care for patients in the state i see uh the only other thing i've just commented and again i'm supporting bills there have been concerns raised in the past i've sat in those meetings where and i you know patient compliance getting patients the tests they need i'm all for that and and by and large believe that that is the case um but there have been concerns raised about you know perhaps over testing when you have in-house testing and you know it's it's it's a very difficult issue for us because i know if i have that patient i've got them in the office i can get i can get important information i need right there they don't have to take off work they don't have to come back in they have transportation issues we can take care of it um take care of their needs and our diagnostic needs and one shot in a visit and that increases compliance and in my opinion increases uh improves outcomes but i know that there is concern uh about um you know the over ordering of tests that may occur is that a concern that we ought to be worried about in the context of this legislation i'm not seeing that as the issue here but i appreciate what you're saying there could be concern of overuse of testing and that's not our focus here to drive people to do more laboratory testing that's not the focus at all the focus here is to be able to get the right kind of testing the example that you use is a perfect one in a physician office laboratory typically they want to be able to perform these wave tests on their patients so that a senior citizen doesn't have to get public transportation go to another facility get the laboratory testing done come back to the physician again or have a phone call from the physician and make a determination are they going to change medications for this patient or is there additional testing that needs to be done and i don't mean laboratory testing i mean other types of testing it's an unfortunate situation that we're in right now that the patients that are in the state here have this kind of bouncing ball that they have to do they have to go to a different facility to get blood work done and that's terrible i will tell you that i think that's not good it's bad for patient care and it's driven by insurance rules and everything else it's something that we may wish to take up at some point but i tell you you know with the focus being on outcomes as it ought to be one of the one of the drivers of outcomes or the detriments to getting to a good outcome is can you get the testing you need at the time you have the patient in the clinic uh and you sort of have them captured if you will so you can get the diagnostic work that you need done and and patients anybody's involved with healthcare knows very well um you know you've got a particularly working hospital you've got to leave and go someplace else and then whenever that patient leaves the leaves the clinic uh the likelihood of getting that needed test done and getting it done on time before the next visit goes way down and it's a shame uh but people you know have to work and and they have transportation difficulties and other challenges that they face and you know it's really something we need to try to get our hands around um we need to do a better job in that area particularly if we're going to focus on improving outcomes as we should do thank you anyone else for this um from this um whatever well we're going to move on then thank you very much uh mr indyk healthcare association new jersey in favor no need to testify samantha uh diameter a new jersey hospital association in favor i need to testify i think that's everyone anyone else on this piece of legislation before i ask for a motion on miss pinken oh i was contacted by somebody who was a pathologist in one of the hospitals who did have some concerns they raised it late on friday i i really don't have the details and they would um like to express their interest to you at some point well they and to sponsor most principally of mr benson's very we'll be very glad to listen to anyone who has a concern about the legislation because they want to make sure it is as good a piece of legislation as we can make it so please refer on to the sponsor and i'm sure uh their concerns will be heard did i hear a question mr eustace and uh second mr benson mr bank you call the roll all right and there are technical amendments to assembly bill two three three two two couple amendments to update the dates on which various requirements in the bill take effect and to make it identical to senate bill 976 so on the motion to report assembly bill 2332 with amendments and senate bill 976 assemblywoman chapisi assemblyman peterson assemblywoman munoz assemblywoman to crouch assembly woman sumpter someone who i'm thinking assemblywoman mcknight assemblyman kennedy assembling woman jimenez and some live in green uh some of them in benson vice chairman eustis yes chairman conway yes assembly bill 2332 is reported with amendments senate bill 976 is reported great thanks um congratulations mr benson uh next we'll take up 3101 conway uh permits registered surgical practices to convert or to combine with ambulatory care facilities provides for phased-in gross receipts assessment authorizes non-profit hospitals to acquire joint ownership interest in practices speaking on this bill we'll have mr mark manning new jersey asc association um mr manning thank you mr chairman members of the committee for this opportunity to talk to you about this proposed legislation it stems from a long history of the state trying to figure out how to kind of regulate these unlicensed so-called unlicensed surgery centers in the state uh goes back to some legislation that came out of this committee in 2000 i think it was 11 that was subsequently vetoed by governor christie which would have required unlicensed surgery centers to become licensed but it would have exempted them from current uh ambulatory care facility rules and regulations and and also the ambulatory care facility assessment we've tried to develop a middle road strategy with the front office through the department of health about whether there was some middle ground that they could tolerate in terms of ambulatory care standards uh it was very difficult to do so the the issue quickly became that any kind of uh standard that we were honing in on would have forced many one rooms to close or undertake unaffordable uh unaffordable investments and renovations so as a result uh the the proposed bill would seek through using a carrot as opposed to a stick to encourage investment in one room surgical centers uh it would permit them to convert to license facilities it would permit them to combined them become licensed meeting current standards it would permit them to combine with existing license facilities to be current and meet current standards with no net increase consistent with the letter and the spirit of the kodi law moratorium against the development of new surgery centers in this state it would uh it would permit those transactions and it would also to encourage this kind of investment uh phase in the applicability of the ambulatory care assessment over five-year period the last thing the bill would do is it would permit uh hospitals to invest directly in the 150 or so one-room surgery centers that exists in the state with the hope that that investment could help uh increase standards etc so that's a very high level review of the bill we thank the sponsor for his support and uh i'm happy to entertain any questions or comments that anyone has missed mcduck hi how are you is there a reason why for-profit hospitals are not included uh that's an issue we're happy to work with the sponsors on on the bill with and you know it's i don't think that's the uh the the hill for my client these the to die on okay thank you [Laughter] you could live i don't know get that flag raised up there you know we're going to charge the hill and get the flag raises anyone else on anyone else for mr manning on this bill i would note that dr mitch reicher president of the jersey orthopedic society is in favor of this bill but does not feel he needs to testify uh anyone else on this legislation if not i'll entertain a motion on the bill miss jimenez uh miss pinken uh mr frankie call the rule on the motion to report assembly bill 3101 assemblywoman to pc assemblyman peterson yes assemblywoman munoz assemblywoman to crouch assemblywoman's sumpter assemblywoman pinking assemblywoman mcknight yes with the exception of adding for-profit hospitals assemblyman kennedy assemblywoman jimenez assemblyman green uh sublime benson vice chairman eustis yes chairman conaway yes the bill is reported thank you next we'll take up ajr 50 rumbly conway venery huddle designates may of each year as youth smoking prevention and awareness month we have a number of people who need to be recognized in this bill i recognized only i suspect i hope uh uh ethan has broken the american cancer society in favor and i need to testify lynn nelson jersey society respiratory care in favor no need to testify karen blumenfeld new jersey gasp in favor no need to testify david henry uh new jersey associates of county city health officers in favor and i need to testify libby vincent new jersey ymca state alliance in favor and i need to testify uh sharon seiler new jersey school board association in favor need to testify and anna ahanzi is njea in favor no need to testify uh with that i'll to entertain a motion on the resolution the sumpter is mr eustis mr frankie paul rule on the motion to report assembly joint resolution 50. assembly woman or assemblyman peterson assemblywoman munoz assemblywoman to crouch assemblywoman sumter assemblywomanpinkin yes i just want to make a note that i was a sponsor on the last version and we'll sign up again to be a sponsor on this version as well thank you assemblywoman mcknight someone kennedy that's one that i'm thinking about assemblywoman in jimenez assemblyman green sumlim and benson vice chairman eustis chairman conway yes the resolution is reported it's real pain and it's detriment to good patient outcome next i guess we'll adjourn this hearing mr greene and issue that we really talked a lot about and maybe uh something women also want to add to it uh this tier type of control over what insurance companies do is that regulated by the governor's office or do we have the input could we have a hearing on that particular issue because i know the majority of the mayors in union county feel that this is really hurting their ability to offer the kind of services they need to offer and also it almost puts them in a situation where they're losing control so i guess my question to you the decision in which way we go with this particular issue is that something that can come through our body of government or is that something that the governor's office controls uh something wrong with munoz if you want to add on to what i'm talking about i appreciate it you do you i know that you were sullivan you were at the uh press conference last week talking about the omnia obviously horizon healthcare and the issue regarding access to care i know you're in burlington county we're in union county um and trinitas hospital which is a major provider is not one of the tier one hospitals but i think we're you know someone green and i and the people in our area as well as your area are very concerned with this classifying things as tier one and the potential to drive these really excellent hospitals out of business because they're forcing all the patients into the the wealth the paying patients into the tier ones so i that's what someone green is addressing and whether or not we're going to do it take it up here you want me to finish what the question was we're going to take it up here or at some other venue well you've i i i've said well a couple times there because the the uh omnia and i should say not omni but rather tiered networks are not on the agenda today we um we have taken up as you uh know uh in this committee and there have been a number of bills uh that have uh been offered uh which uh and a number of them are now uh in other committees it's not to say that this committee um will not take up further the issue of tier networks but it is an issue that will be taken up by the legislature um i have assurance that that will take place now as respects the the issue at hand of your question is might this committee well i'm not i'm not opposed to a hearing on the issue we will certainly take this issue there certainly may be reason to take this issue up again um as i say there are their legislation is moving in the legislature in both the assembly and the senate uh and there may very well be a time a particularly appropriate time for this committee to take up the issue again of the tiered networks again i i have mentioned on the record and and continue to say that like many here have concerns about uh the impact of tier networks tiered networks are not new um you mentioned whether or not the governor's office is involved in this is insurance plans as you know submit their their plans their insurance plans to the departments for review we have a rather deregulated marketplace with respect to those types of plans and their use in our marketplace uh and i imagine there are some who want to take up take up that question uh going forward and uh it's their right to do so and and legislation on on that will be reviewed as all pieces of legislation are reviewed um to see if they get the support if they can get a hearing if they can move forward so uh if your question is are we um paying attention to what's going on with respect to networks the answer is yes um and um and there may very well be a time when this committee will need uh to have further discussions more discussions than we've already had on the issue and when that time comes uh we'll all know it together so thank you for that question um unusual as it is at this time but i appreciate it nonetheless i would like to adjourn this hearing and move on to the question of our public hearing on water quality in the state of new jersey we uh as you know so we're adjourned on that let me just i guess that makes it official um as uh anybody who's followed the the news and the reporting i cannot help but be concerned dismayed at the situation in flint michigan uh that has resulted in a public health crisis with really long a lasting implication for those affected persons who live in flint and it's naturally raised concern uh around the country and certainly here in new jersey uh that uh for our own water supply and our own water quality um i'm sure a number of you have over your career taken an interest in this issue i as many of you know we passed that our committee a bill to to regulate uh to put an mc uh mcl on one two three tcp uh which has shown up in high concentrations and the water supply of one of the towns i represent in moore's town as i understand it you know has been addressed by dp and will continue to be addressed uh and and as i expressed in that legislation i concerned that it's not just um the town of morristown which may be facing difficulties with this any communities which rewards farming communities with housing on it any communities which once um held involved in industrial operations may see this particular contaminant in their water and i uh for one i think the state uh uh should have a state a wide testing program on this because it is a known carcinogen has been known to be so for some time we also have the issues around let lead which are certainly in the news and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect people uh from uh exposure to lead um and so we're gonna hear from people involved in that game and other world water quality issues uh during this hearing uh first we're going to bring up new jersey citizen action and vardman uh to offer testimony on this issue along with the housing community development network of new jersey stacey berger and along with isles incorporated elise pivnick however you choose now i don't know everyone so well you've got your light on you look like you're ready to go so please uh introduce yourself and we'll be happy to hear from you uh thank you chairman my name is ann vardaman i'm the program director at new jersey citizen action and i would really like to take the opportunity to thank you for holding this hearing you know what has happened in flint has raised the consciousness about this issue across the country and what we've you know what's come to light and what we're here to talk about today is that this is a crisis in new jersey uh last year more than 3 100 children were poisoned by lead in new jersey if this were a virus an illness that was going around and causing brain damage in 3100 children you would think that we would be investing a lot of resources in preventing that from happening especially something that is entirely preventable like lead poisoning and that's not what's been happening in new jersey instead funding that's supposed to be going to the lead hazard control assistance fund has been diverted into the general fund now i would just like to take a moment to read a quote about lead poisoning from i just want to be clear about one thing for going forward now now we we know that lead has um access to it can not only come through water and we are focusing on on on water and um and i do um i want to be uh sensitive to uh the fact that there are other sources of lead but i would really like to focus on war and lead itself generally we could take up as well um but i just want to as you make your points about lead and lead poisoning if you could try to clarify whether we're dealing with a waterborne situation or something that is uh in the environment housing lead painting like i'd appreciate that as you go forward i just just talked about it i mean i just like to say you know the primary source of lead poisoning in new jersey is from paint and old homes however if you live in a home that was built before 1986 you also have lead pipes uh for your plumbing which means that there is the possibility of lead in your drinking water and part of the issue is that if you are being exposed to lead in your home from paint from dust from dirt the lead that's coming in in your water also then continues to build up you have the situation where often if you're in a house that has lead paint in an older home you also have lead pipes therefore there is going to be some lead in your water but the primary source of lead poisoning in new jersey is from paint 1986 for lead for pipes for plumbing however for paint it's 1972 so even in a home that would be designated lead free for example because there's no longer lead paint you could still have lead plumbing and like what happened in flint the issue is that while you know lead pipes are generally safe if you have a corrosive agent in your water that breaks off more of the pipes then you're going to have higher lead levels in the water going into a home so i'm yeah um you want to go ahead if somebody wants to as you mentioned the corrosive elements that are added into the water to deal i think with uh questions of cleaning the water but also we now has an impact on the sled someone can talk anyone coming up who can speak about these sort of uh anti-corrosive elements that are placed into the water and what their potential impacts might be i'd appreciate uh some information on that as well you are i'm stacey berger i'm the president and ceo of the housing and community development network of new jersey we're the statewide association of 150 community development organizations many of whom have been on the front lines working to rehabilitate homes and communities that have suffered from lead i have no expertise in water contamination or corrosive elements so i don't even want to report to talk about that but i did want to share a couple of issues that have come to our attention first i wanted to tell you a little bit about what we've heard since we kicked off the lead lead free kids new jersey campaign which you may have read about over the last few weeks because um of what's happened in flint which is a horrible terrible criminal situation we have really taken a refocused look at what's going on here in new jersey and feel very strongly as to 109 i believe other organizations that have signed a letter to the governor and to legislative leaders asking that the 10 million dollars that's been dedicated 50 cents per gallon of paint purchase in new jersey that money is required under the law to go to the lead control hazard fund and that is where it should be going we know that the impact of lead in paint is completely preventable it costs about five to ten thousand dollars maximum to rehabilitate a home that's had lead poisoning it costs about thirty two thousand dollars a year to deal with a child who has special needs and disabilities as a result of lead poisoning so we can spend the money now or we can spend the money later but we're going to have to spend that money so we may as well do it in a way that saves lives and improves the quality of life for people who live in our state i just want to share with you one quick story that we heard that it broke my heart that i couldn't help this woman before she got to this situation we were contacted by a young woman named tara mcgill south jersey mom she and her family moved into a beautiful victorian home in collingswood built in 1890 and she was informed that it was completely gut renovated and totally clean um she didn't know anything about lead didn't have any reason to ask about lead never was disclosed to her by her landlord that there were any issues there wasn't until after they moved in that they found paint peeling in various areas of their home and they paid for an out of pocket inspection they found a dust level in their foyer of 131 hud regulations allow under 40. and the centrally seen ceiling vent in the kitchen had about 56 blowing out of their out into their entire home basically spewing lead dust everywhere by the time her daughter was a year old she had developed tooth decay she had developed strepomysis i'm not a doctor many of you are so most of you know that's better known as cross-eyes am i pronouncing it incorrectly she stopped thriving she grew only an inch or an inch and a half from the time they lived in the house she stopped sleeping she started screaming at about two and a half years old which is about she is now she fits into about 18 month old clothing her daughter and her parents and their these parents are going to live with the impact of that for the rest of their lives completely and totally preventable and she called us and said can you help my daughter can you help us and i said i will do whatever i can to put you in touch with whatever resources we can find but this should never have happened it shouldn't happen to tara mcgill and it shouldn't happen to any other child like hers we can absolutely fix this if we decide to put the resources that are needed to make that happen and that's really what it comes down to whether we decide that we can and and will do what is necessary to make sure that we protect the future generation of new jersey's kids so we hope we really appreciate you having this hearing today we we know that in particular in some cities the pipe situation is a problem in some schools i know that wnyc reported earlier this month that the city of camden is using bottled water for its school children at the cost of about 75 000 a year because there's lead or suspected lead contamination in their water pipes so that's something to think about when you think we hear from experts that have more you know expertise on the water side is whether those schools have the adequate resources they need to either address the pipe problem or figure out a way guess not if you're planning water party i guess not if you're buying bottled water right i mean you know it's it's also it's not a great use of resources to buy bottled water because we're not actually fixing the problem but it is way better than treating kids for lead poisoning or allowing them to be poisoned in the first place so we really appreciate your interest and enthusiasm about solving this problem we need everybody to do this this is not a partisan issue this is about children and it's something that is completely preventable and we have dedicated tax revenue to do this so please make sure that that goes in the budget um miss pimenek my name is elise pivnick and i'm the director of environmental health for ielts we're a trenton-based community development and environmental organization founded 35 years ago to foster more self-reliant families and healthy sustainable communities i've been working in the community development field for over 30 years i serve on the board of the national center for healthy housing and i have a graduate degree in city planning so i've been working on these issues both at the state level at the national level and also looking at things at the local level because it's all those levels that need to come together for a solution here it's not just one one actor here because of flint michigan most of the world now knows about knows lead in water can poison children the deplorable water scandal is an important story but it's just as tragic and alarming that thousands of children in new jersey continue to be exposed to lead year after year from lead paint in their homes lead paint is by far the most common source of exposure the facts are not meant to be competition with flint but to highlight the neglected lead poisoning story of thousands of children in new jersey since 2000 about 225 000 young children in new jersey have levels above the cdc reference level of five micrograms per deciliter 3 000 new cases in just 2015 children with this amount of lead are 30 percent more likely to fail third grade reading and math uh test they are seven more times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to become involved in the juvenile justice system i've distributed some packets there's a table here which says tells us in 2014 new jersey reported equal to or higher percentage of children tested with elevated blood levels above 5 in 11 cities in new jersey in comparison to flint so one of the things when the flint [Music] tragedy broke is they were talking about the on the numbers in flint and because i've been looking at new jersey data for years i went back to look at the new jersey data and um for the year 2015 in flint there were 112 children that had levels above five in just in trenton new jersey in 2014 which is when our latest data is 214 children i believe um you look at newark you can see the numbers there so this is an ongoing problem in new jersey in all of our older cities this is not unique to new jersey but we have got the tools that um uh uh to put together to solve this problem i also added a table because i also got some data that looked at the number of children starting kindergarten with elevated blood levels and this is an important distinction what you're looking at here is annual data this tells you that in a single year this many children were tested and this many children had levels above five but if you add up the single highest test for children who are starting kindergarten you've got a number that's two to two to two and a half times greater um for children starting uh school so if you want to look at um there's a table here uh you can look at it says in camden the only the latest uh year i have data for it's 2012 to 2013. 13 children um 13 of children were starting uh school with la the blood levels in irvington it was nearly 20 percent new brunswick 10 et cetera and i can go over this data with folks at another time um so you may hear that people say that the reduction in lead poisoning over the last 20 years is a great public health success and if you are if you're looking at national data indeed it is but the national data conveniently hides a harsh fact lead poisoning disproportionately affects poor minority children primarily in our nation's oldest cities minority children's rates of lead poisoning are two to four times the national average i think if you are a parent in trenton or newark you do not think we have a public health success so while we've moved remove lead from gasoline and paint in the 70s what we do know that there's still many homes in our older cities that are are obviously carrying hazardous levels of lead out of 1500 homes that isles has tested in trenton over the years more than 60 percent had enough lead to present uh to affect enough lead present to affect a child's iq um so the cost of this hazard continues to be immense and one of the points i really want to emphasize here is that what is strangely misunderstood is that the costs of lead poisoning are primarily born outside the health sector in social and economic costs in special education disproportionate incarceration of young minority men family stress and life long disability payments for children who grow up and to be unemployable adults um so there's a study published by the uh new jersey public advocate back in 2009 that that said um basically a child who's been led poison will will cost government about 31 thousand dollars per year um probably for it could be up to the rest of their lives when you just count in a lot of other things so what does it cost to make a homeless safe our experience at isles where we do make homes led safe in combination with doing energy improvements it's between five and twelve thousand dollars a unit and the cost not to remediate again is that thirty one thousand dollars uh per child per year um so uh the most effective methods uh for um for reducing lead poisoning is what we call primary prevention that is making the home lead safe the way we work now is we test our children and they're like canaries in the coal mine once they become poisoned everybody comes to attention and they may go to the house to look what what the problems are it doesn't make any sense and we could be doing a proactive program of inspections there are there are cities and states in the country that are doing a good job of this um city of road uh state of rhode island they have now you have to have a lead certificate let's say um certificate in order to rent a home rent out at home if you're a landlord in rhode island and there's just been a study published by janet curry professor janet curry at princeton university and she showed that by making lead lead safe home repairs in rhode island by requiring that they have a lead safe a landlord have a lead safe certificate there there was a reduction in racial disparities in education by 54 percent it's huge it's huge so we're here to say that new jersey can do better uh while new jersey has programs of education and training about lead poisoning particularly strong in the new jersey counties affected by super storm sandy it's not enough and there are a lot of specific actions i would love to review with you i've included our strategic plan for healthy homes that we worked on for the state of new jersey there's a draft in your in your packets and obviously we think it's very important to restore the 10 million dollars to the lead hazard control fund because prevention again is the key to reducing lead poisoning you don't want to go in after a child has been poisoned it's really too late and this fund gives an opportunity for low-income homeowners and landlords who rent to low-income uh tenants to make their homes lead safe and it's a missing piece of our arsenal to fight lead poisoning um so there's other things there's a i think you probably landed a good place to end okay and um we will take up the information in this packet i um i think i'm speaking for all of us when um uh when i say that there's a that we have a great interest in this issue it does you do speak to this question of as charge term environmental racism but just just the disparate impact of of how of that comes to people who live in poor housing stock who live uh with uh with poor resources to deal with these kinds of challenges and and have following challenges that that go out of control because of things like lent poisoning which will interfere with your ability to get the education you need to pull yourself up out of poverty in the first place so it is it is a it's it's really a um it is a scourge that we have to take on in my view and um i would ask on the uh in terms of the of the um numbers that are shown here uh those people who are presenting uh with greater than five milligrams per deciliter of uh of lead in their blood how were those children discovered was it testing in their pediatrician's office was it a public health program that went through a neighborhood and and either drew blood or did i don't know if a finger stick works for this or not and then somebody's come up with a finger stick for this well there's a capillary test in the venus test but most i can't most instances would be the pediatrician there may be some you know cities that have done public health programs uh public health events where you bring in children to have them tested but typically it is done in the pediatrician's office and all tests must be reported to the state and that's where you get an annual lead surveillance report so this is this is this is folks who have a pediatrician then take their child to the pediatrician and the pediatrician then tests them and uh and that's how these numbers are appearing on these charts so that if you don't right you could go to a public health clinic as well i mean it's not there's you know who access the health care system so you have to access the health care system for the most part in order to show up in these statistics correct and which is why the numbers may be lower than anybody thinks that they are um and you know again remember this is just one year of children coming through um you have for children starting kindergarten they might have been tested at age one h2 h3h four or five so you know these numbers and oh since this is reflective one more i know other people have a question so you just raise something which now if you are discovered at age one and i think probably there might be somebody come up to speak this now we test you again at age three is what i'm trying to get at is there a tracking of that child who presents at age one so that we hopefully know that they are that their number is going to why she's a minute we're going to hear about that so well here's well i'll just i'll just speak to that so your the department of health can tell you whether a child was tested at one or three the problem is nobody does anything with this information it's as if there's a firewall between the department of health and educators who you think would care a lot about this information and i'm i'm calling your attention to a document that was published last may by the cdc it's called uh recommended it's education interventions for children affected by lead and it calls for early monitoring early developmental assessments enriched programs etc and in fact it's the document that's being followed to make recommendations for children in flint who are affected by lead and i i suggest that the children of new jersey deserve nothing less and that we should be looking at how we can bring education health housing together to do a more comprehensive plan for helping children we can be much more efficient in what we're doing yes um i you know i'm somebody who absolutely believes in keeping our water healthy one of the first bills i ever did was about drinking water not being able to flush stuff into drinking water so you know i'm somebody who's very balanced about this stuff but i do have questions because i think oftentimes in politics in public health things we can create hysteria that sometimes is not there and so i just want to go through some of the things that were discussed and try to understand it because i have vastly different data and i'm just trying to get my arms around sure what's correct and what's not um you know numbers of 3 100 3 000 new cases were put out with respect to the five millimeter um threshold that's being used what states in the country use the five millimeter threshold okay it's a good question because i think what you're getting at is milligrams is probably that the state of new jersey considers 10 the actionable level and so most states who receive cdc funding have adopted the cdc reference level of 5 and above micrograms per deciliter as the actionable level and the cdc says that that is where children are at risk at that level and they also state in the same report that there is no safe level of lead in other words we see a lot of impacts now at levels as low as three and four and i can again direct you to the education interventions report by the cdc where they summarize the research and i'm happy to distribute that to you so one of the things that um the the state of new jersey has not adopted the cdc reference level and it's it's a political choice it's not a choice it's particularly based on science so can you tell me what states have adopted that level um you know what i actually have a table and i don't have it here i'm happy to share it with you because i did the research on it but just about all of them um have have adopted the level of five um and above and there's i think it's 22 states or slightly higher have been funded by cdc for lead not all states are funded by the cdc for lead surveillance okay because it's my understanding that there are only 17 states in total that even require universal uh screening for lead in new jersey is one of those and that's excellent that's excellent we we get a lot of we that's where we should be we have a very deep problem here and that's excellent so out of the screening that has taken place um in the numbers that i have for 2015 that there were 205 607 children who were tested for lead compared with just 10 298 because of these additional screenings but out of the 2015 data from i think the department of health only 885 children had the elevated levels pursuant to the current thresholds in new jersey so i think again that's using the levels of 10. new jersey is saying that this this department of health says our actionable levels are at 10. the cdc is saying that five is an actionable level and i chose to compare levels of five to levels of five but whether it was flint michigan new jersey or whatever so i believe that that's what their numbers are referring to and those numbers are much lower if you only look at levels of 10 and above and with the flint reference um one thing i just want to make sure that we're accurate on the flint numbers that were provided excludes the 8 000 new cases that came about as a result of the infiltration of the water supply from so here's here's a tricky thing so what we know is that there's i think it's about 9 000 children of six and under live in flint that's u.s census data and i think what people describe is that all of those children have been exposed to lead what we know is since when the water changed in april of 2014 okay what we know is between then and through and through january of this year that they tested approximately two-thirds of the children who of age six and under and there's been a hundred and eighty six children who have tested high so it's a very different number to say the number of children who have been exposed versus the number of children who actually have elevated blood levels by doing the venous test or whatever test was done for those children remember by the way just for clarification that's at the 5 milligrams per deciliter or the 10. i'm five i'm talking about five and i have the michigan data with me i'm happy to share it and what i did try to do is i tried to compare only a single year to a single year it was not accurate to take the you know 18 months of exposure and compare it to one year of exposure here and i'm happy to go over all the details your questions are really good and i'm i'm very happy i'm pleased to be able to clarify this that because i you know it's you know it makes you dizzy it makes you dizzy you want to make sure you're comparing oranges and that we're looking at this the right way and i don't think anybody sitting up here would say lead poisoning in children is good under any circumstances it's more a function of you know what is the appropriate approach you know making sure that we're doing it in a well thought out way rather than just a reactionary way because we saw something really bad happen in michigan and so i'm just trying to educate myself thank you ladies for your testimony miss pipkin you said you've been involved in this for 30 years not with i've been working as a city planner for 30 years i've been involved in healthy homes and lead poisoning prevention for the last 10. okay okay so prior to that i'm sure many people in the room remember the national tv commercials about pika and instructing parents on not to have children eat lead chips and things like that and i was just curious number one what was your take on that education process and number two is this part of uh prenatal education or or pre-parental education because we won't be able to solve the houses immediately but there i remember a national program where they talked to parents about not letting your kids eat paint chips not letting your kids do three things i think were on the list and i'm just curious if you thought that was successful should we resurrect that because uh taking care of the homes isn't gonna happen overnight but if we could address something with a public uh service announcement absolutely i think those are those are great points and i think what happened here there's two things um we took lead out of gasoline and we took lead out of new paint and that caused resulted in a huge decline in lead poisoning nationally again you have the stubborn continuing pockets of lead poisoning in our old inner cities so what's happened is that the public says well aren't we done with this problem right and our educators say aren't we done with this problem um you know i had occasion to talk to um the former super now former superintendent of trenton schools and he said you know i don't know why we stopped talking about lead i have no idea who's lead poisoned in my schools and the special ed staff said the same thing because we don't even require that lead screenings be shared with educators so when you enter school you don't have to submit a lead screening to the school and there's we don't we don't even share the data that's collected with medic in most instances for poor children it's collected with medic medicaid money right and it sits in a database and the department of health is doing its job it's not they're not at fault there's this firewall here and educators don't even know to ask for the information and we can just be doing a much better job coordinating what we know with what we need to do and if we don't even define the problem well we're not going to solve it so people think the problems disappear because they never even look at the lead surveillance reports which is a whole other story because they're very hard to read so good place to end right there on that for that mr peterson and then we'll come back to miss pinken and then quickly what do you want to talk about you meant to mention you want to mention them about what we're we we're we're talking about lead and water right wasn't that that was yes well let me i know a little bit about this um because new jersey back in 2001 passed a statute that required uh testing of water and uh out where i live um you have wells we predominantly have wells so in 2002 the law went into effect and it did two things it required every time a house was sold a transaction occurred there had to be a water test done at the source and at the where it comes out of your faucet and then those test results come back and it's not just let it everything under the side because arsenic is an issue radon is an issue in water there's all these other issues um and then it comes back and tells you what your concentration is of different things in the water um and lead is one of the is one of the things that is uh tested for if there is lead in the water and the city of canada should look into this there's light in the water there are systems that will take the lead out of the water and uh and make it safe to drink they're not very expensive but it's just one more thing you have to do in your water like a water softener or what have you now as far as public water supplies go you probably all got them in the mail if you have a public water supply they have to do a test every year and then they have to notify you of the results of those tests so our water in new jersey is constantly tested and one of the good things about the the private well water testing results was it allowed the dep to track to see where there's problems with uh water in new jersey um outside because a lot of that water ends up in your public systems comes from my area and ends up down river where you guys take it out so there's this testing going on so our water system is pretty good as far as the lead pipes lead pipes i'll tell you i looked at thousands and thousands of home inspection reports i've never really seen any lead pipes cast iron copper pvc is more common um but what the what the issue is with lead as far as piping goes was there was solder that had led in it it's a low concentration of lead in it and there's some lead in some pipe copper piping but very little what happens is the solder is really where the issue is if the soldering wasn't done well and you have corrosive water the ph is off or what have you um it can seep into the water well mister what's the point of this well what are you trying to get to the whole i thought this whole thing was we were worried about what happened to flint michigan is it happening here yes well the issue is is that new jersey's way ahead where that couldn't have actually have happened here because of all the things that we've done to take care of it here in new jersey to prevent it i mean i would agree with you that there are a number of things here and i and i would agree with the statement that we don't want to cause uh alarm but it also is true that we do have problems and we have to take cognizance of them there are issues about testing the question is how frequent they are and then what's done uh with respect to um notification of the public and how what kinds of actions need to be followed up to make sure their remediation the testing program that you're talking about the the actionable level you know you it not every home is tested there is there's a statistical analysis of that now if your home happens to have lead in it and in fact i was helping my dad with it with one of his houses in boarding town we were digging up he had a lead water pipe going into the house there so there are there are issues uh around lead that we know uh that are that are spotty um that uh involve infrastructure that involve things in the environment that involve um uh any number of things and you've got to get at all the points and the main thing is to find out what's happening at the tap what's happening in the home what's happened to the children of being affected so uh i appreciate this history about it but we're going to be running out of time so is there you know if your point is that we have a pretty good regulatory system in new jersey i would agree with you uh is it perfect i nothing is are there things that will that this legislature want to do with respect to water there's no and particularly the private laws that you mentioned because i i had to deal with that with that situation myself in the testing uh so i know about that firsthand um then we are then we want to find out about it and we want to do what we can to improve it ms sumter you have a question thank you mr chairman thank you ladies i was more concerned with the type of registry from the state um especially when i know that pediatricians and health care systems report birth defects and they are adamant about the facilities reporting this data as well as private practitioners can you tell me again what happens with that information so my understanding is information gets um for the any lead screening levels will get forwarded to the department of health there's a lead surveillance unit and they publish an annual report um and it has many tables in there that says you know tells you about children who are i think it's you know age three and below or and then there's the children who are six and below it reports by uh by city if the if the town is 50 000 people or more it rep reports by county you have um uh it's very hard to follow for starters and one of the things that um is being is happening other places that we could easily do here start geocoding this information so you can start seeing where the concentrations are obviously without personal addresses you do it with color of concentration where things are but the information never gets to the educators it never gets to the teachers it never gets to the special ed uh folks and you know i have a a story from several years ago about i was talking to a principal in their trenton school and they were trying and trying trying to figure out what's going on with the child and finally the father stepped forth and said do you think that you know that my child had a high lead level you think that might have something to do with it it was like a huge piece of the puzzle for them um so we have this information and it's not being used to the benefit of the child the reason why points points points mr chairman mr may i just add one piece very short briefly to that the other piece of tracking that is not done is for one and two family unit homes the state is supposed to be under the 2008 law tracking inspecting and tracking and publicizing one and two family units four led in the home and that is not happening right now well that's we have to find out about that that's why we have other people that want to come up and i'm worried that we are i mean you're providing a lot of information but i'd like to get the questions out quickly and answer that quickly so we can move through it if we could um speeches but what what um do you have a question i was just going to say that generally they test these children no it's a comment that's at 18 months and six years and even for the pediatricians it was difficult to get the state to give that information back and we would say why are we not doing geo mapping why aren't we looking at it overall and we could never get the data and talking to the surveillance groups well good so that's something we need to work on that sounds like uh thank you ladies um uh we're gonna bring up the next channel we have uh daniel j uh van abs phd professor um research professor at rutgers university on on the clean water council we have um uh dr uh put head modem well dr rad you put red in parentheses and i tried anyway so you're gonna have to you're gonna have to do it for me md phd and f double ap um uh gentlemen dr van absen this will start with you guys chairman committee thank you for having the invitation to be here today the flint michigan issue that we have seen has major health implications for its residents it's important that new jersey takes the right lessons from this and not the wrong lessons from this first thing i'll say is that the flint michigan issue is the result of a systemic failure in the decision-making and regulatory process that's been acknowledged at this point water professionals know how to deal with this issue of lead in water they know how to deal with this issue of copper in water there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for what happened in flint so the question is whether new jersey should be worried about this issue and when you're dealing with these risk assessments you're dealing with three different issues one is structural second is treatment and the third is management with regard to structural there's absolutely no doubt that we have places in new jersey mostly the older urban and older suburban areas of the state where we have lead lines that are running from the curb to the buildings and we have in some cases lead lines within the buildings in other cases we have copper lines with lead solder the big issue is probably those lead service lines between the curb and the house and then you have additional issues as well so we have this and if we have corrosive water and by the way corrosiveness is a whole chemical issue um one of the principal answers in flinders i understand yes um it's yes that plus stupidity yes um and so the correctivity ph issues um buffering issues and and so on so the second issue is whether our the lead in our plumbing is being allowed to cause a problem and in general the answer is no but i am aware of some systems that are up close to the action levels and they are trying to figure out how to deal with this issue there are a number of new jersey systems that are already adding anti-corrosion compounds phosphates polyphosphates orthophosphates to their water supply systems to knock down the lead levels they're adjusting their ph to knock down the lead levels the question is the problem is that there's no such thing as perfect the use of these treatment technologies is to minimize the lead level the only way one eliminates the lead in the water is by eliminating the lead in the systems and that's a very expensive process so the third samsung lead in the systems now are we talking about are we talking about lead in the pipes and and solder and copper pipe systems or are we talking about lead that's in the water because of the way the water percolated to the ground and then sucked up in and and put into water treatment both of those things or one of them when you mentioned water the lead levels that come from water supply treatment systems are negligible the issue is not what comes from the treatment plants the the problem is what gets picked up in the water as it's being sent from the the treatment system out through water mains you even in the old urban areas you may not have lead lines but you often will have lead joints between sections of steel because it was a very malleable way of of dealing with this so you may have like joints there and then you have the lead service lines from the curb into the building and so on so the amount of lead that we get from the treatment plants is negligible [Music] yes so the third question is whether new jersey could have something happen like in flint and one would certainly hope that no water utility would be so um inappropriate in their management as to do something like that and that our regulatory system would not allow for it but one thing we should recognize is that um municipal utility and regulatory staff can all feel pressured to minimize alarm to adopt a bunker mentality to minimize costs and so this is something that you have to guard against we've been doing a good job but it doesn't mean that it's permanent so it's something that you can never let your guard down i should also mention that the treatment that is required for these systems is essentially permanent because you can't ethically be treating water to reduce lead and then society at some point well it's only a few people that are going to get poisoned and therefore we're no longer going to treat so this is going to be going on for essentially forever from our perspective the other aspect of this though and this is where i'm going to add me it wouldn't go on forever if the pipes change and we're not putting lead in the water through the piping then it wouldn't go on forever well and we get a question if we have tens of thousands of homes who have these kinds of issues how long is it going to take us to modify tens of thousands of homes so from a political from i will say it's going to be generational maybe not forever but it's generational this is going to take a very long time so the other issue of course is that the lead issue is only one piece of the entire puzzle because these very same areas have very old infrastructure and it's aging very fast and so in addition to the lead issue you have the fact that we're getting water main breaks all over the place this is going to be when you deal with water supply and waste water tens of billions of dollars of costs over the next couple of decades to deal with these infrastructure issues plus the private cost in new jersey in new jersey plus the private costs of dealing with lead issues within the properties within the property boundary all right so i was asked um when i was invited to throw out some ideas that the legislature might consider and i'd like to pose a set of ideas one is very much in line with what mr peterson raised about the private well testing act the notion that statutory changes to require the elimination of lead service lines in rental properties within some period of time and for homes upon sale or transfer might be a really interesting idea in the way of dealing with this dc has been replacing thousands of lead service lines lansing michigan is almost done with their process it is feasible to do this tied to that how can water supply utilities and other entities provide interim financing to property owners for the cost of repair of replacing the lead service lines and the lines within their homes some people just can't afford this stuff as a single chunk of money coming out of their budget third and this ties to the issue of assets the urban water assets is as a total our statutes are not really clear in terms of giving dep the authority to require asset management of water utilities wastewater utilities in new jersey our regulations are focused on water quality the point of delivery to a customer at the water quality of effluent discharge but they say very little about the integrity of the water utility systems in between those two points so that's an issue that could be looked at fourth all of this is going to drive water rates and sewer rates up and they're going to drive them up in places that have a lot of very poor households for energy we have a household assistance program for water and sewer we do not and so how could the state look into that kind of issue and finally and this might be coming a little bit from left field but you've all heard of cities that have been talking about selling their water utilities their muas and getting money in to use for general tax abatement or whatever it happens to be i would argue that the users of those utilities paid for those utilities and so if there is money coming in it should go back to the benefit of those customers and one way it could do so is by applying it to the cost of lead service line removals of infrastructure improvements and so on five ideas just food for them thank you very much appreciate that doc hi uh thank you mr chairman i'm i'm dr radhakrishnan i'm known as dr rad and trent and i've been here for 25 years and it's a funny position that i'm in because i've been a patient advocate a child advocate and i'm bringing you information on as to what the doh is doing because i've been involved with the sled program in new jersey for 25 years when i first moved to jersey in 1990 we had a led advisory committee that the state had set up along with the doh and i was i participated in the first guidelines that were issued for providers and for communities as to how to deal with lead poisoning in the state of new jersey so i just wanted to address a couple of the issues that i you know that did come up from the previous presenters one of the issues was you know what are we doing with this data are we providing it to schools that we're providing it to other people new jersey we do have a form that's called a universal form that's uh given to all children who either go to preschool daycare or to regular school and on that form we do initiate the resulting of lead levels onto that because there is no other way to provide this to the schools there is a spot on that form that says what was the last leg level done uh when was the last ppd done um and along with that you know that's for the height and weight and stuff but so it is there and as far as what the doh is doing um there was a question about the registry and you know what do we do with the data unfortunately that registry at this point does not include lead levels and we are advocating for it both on the depart on the uh part of the american academy of pediatrics and from providers that this include lead levels so that it's available statewide and that hasn't happened yet so hopefully it will one of these days as far as tracking the data the state has done an amazing job over the last 25 years coming from where we had no data at all to a point where they required that every single lab that does a test on a child it doesn't matter where the test was done it could have been done in timbuktu but if that child lives in the state of new jersey that result needs to come to the state of uh of uh new jersey and the doh has that which is amazing um and that data is available to anybody who wants it you can call up the department of health and they'll be happy to give you that information so did you guys post on our website is it is it available for researchers to get to which yes it's available for researchers to get to by requesting it's not available on our website um there is there is data that's available on the website but it's not individually to communities towns school districts stuff like that but that's something you can get by calling the department of health um and asking them for that specific drill down data and there have been a number of studies that have been done new work did a great study a few years ago about this they were able to pull the data from the department of health and compare to what they were seeing at the university centers um so this data is available big data is available you mean as identifiable data or as de-identified data no it's de-identified it's not perpetration yeah um so so that's very important to remember you know we've come to a point um where when i started in practice 25 years ago we were thinking of 40 being a level um that was significant and actionable only because that's the only thing we even today we can't treat a lead level of 10 of 12 15 we can only treat a child who has had a level that's over than 40. and there was some question about you know lead levels being done by capillary testing versus lead level testing the whole thing is capillary testing is a screening tool it's very important it's freely available every pediatrician in the state pretty much knows that we can do a capillary test right in the office send it off on a metox form and get the results back um the only point sorry i'm sorry i bet i could interrupt you i apologize but i have to get out now did i hear you say because i was on the dp maybe they didn't give me that that you said you can't treat what can't you treat telekinesis about 40 milligrams what is this there there we talk about an actionable level of five now that the cdc wants but what action what they mean by action is education nutritional information uh screening and continuing to to watch this kid and do the test every six months and we have a schedule when you want to get tested depending on what the levels are but as far as treating that lead by what we call chelation which means you give medication calcium edta saxoma you can't do that until the level hits 40. okay the the side effects of the medications are such that you don't want to take a chance on the kid who's under 40 and the fda hasn't approved it for a level less than 40. so unless you hit 40 we're not treating you right okay so there are a lot of controversies with that but the point is still that we can't treat you unless you get to 40. so um the levels being 1 2 3 5 10 15 is still the same we want to address every single child who has the potential to be lead poisoned in the same way of providing education isles does a great job of making sure that the homes are cleaned up and we can get some abatement done um the pla you know we've come from a point where we had no abatement resources in the state to now where in in a town like new work they have permanent housing available for families that are affected by lead poisoning in the home um so we're doing a lot you know it's funny for me to kind of advocate and what the doh is doing but yeah we are doing a lot and the only problem i found was that over the last five ten years we were getting complacent you know we were getting to the point where we're doing a great job let's just sit back and that shouldn't have happened and it did happen but fortunately uh we got grants from the you know from you guys uh for the post sandy uh work and i've been involved with education throughout the state both for providers community organizations school districts and we've been going around and talking to everybody saying you know you need to make sure that this is on the forefront because as everybody knows unless you're thinking of something you're not going to recognize it so we want to make sure that everybody is aware that this is a problem that is still there in new jersey and if we're not watching it we are seeing numbers creep up again in communities where you know somebody left off and didn't do their uh due diligence on on screening these kids so we have laws every child in the state of new jersey has to have a lead level at age one and age two and we you know post sandy doh put out regulations that if you live in one of those nine counties that sandy affected you better make sure there's another level done doesn't matter how many lead levels were done before but we won one now for this year uh if you're under the age of six so you know we're out there we're trying to work hard we just want to make sure education gets out there so the parents are aware what they need to be looking for make sure that that child have the lead level done make sure the school's aware that when that form comes in there's a lead level on that screen in my practice like we won't fill up that form till you get the blood test done and we have the results back that's an incentive for us to make sure that the parents get the blood test done and it's making sure that the parents are aware that it's very important that they need to know that what the results are before they go back into school and i think that's very important to educate both parents community schools um all providers that this is something that we need to be looking for very importantly um so like i said the most important thing is education education education once it's 40 it's too late you know those are the kids that we're finding having a big problem you know it's it's a social stigma you know agreed but the point is that you've created it by not taking care of that child when he had a level of five or ten and making sure it wasn't getting any higher thank you doctors for your testimony um so my question is you say educate educate educate you're collecting the data from boards of education or from the schools why isn't it automatic that that education returns to the department of education or returns to the school so the educators know you have a problem here with the kids well the department of health has the data and the school districts that do use those unifor universal forms do get the data i don't know what they do with the data but they do get the data and i'm sorry if i missed this i had to step out uh for a second but with respect to lowering the potential for lead contamination in some of these older homes and recognizing that it could be generationally before we can actually switch out pipes and everything else as a lower cost easy fix to that are there filters that can be utilized in some of these homes to reduce that risk i think he wants that yeah all right there are filters well they're not filters but there are treatment devices the problem with treatment devices that are used within the home is that they have to be monitored routinely they have to have their resins replaced routinely because otherwise the materials actually build up to the filter where it super saturates and it dumps a much higher concentration of that contaminant than what was in the original water so yeah point of entry treatment as they're called or point of use treatment that you would have on tap they're there that you could do it but it's fraught with potential difficulties you'd be far better off frankly um buying jokes of water for potable purposes and then using your regular water supply for everything else but even better yet is for the water utility to be properly adding anti-corrosion uh materials to their water supply so that you don't have that problem now obviously if you're on a domestic well two things one is you're on your own in turn it's your well it's your plumbing it's your home therefore you're going to have to deal with it so then the question is well what's better from your family's perspective replace the lead lines take out the lead solder or have a treatment device the advantage to taking out all of the the lead from your system is that it's permanent once you're done you're done recognize that but from a pragmatic perspective because you provide a testimony and i think people agree it could be decades before you're replacing all of these entire systems so you know in giving educating people and going out there and trying to reduce whatever is currently taking place you know looking at other options that exist it would seem to be a more plausible option if people are you know doing what they're supposed to be doing whether or not it's a landlord whether or not it's a person who owns a home themselves or a resident and knowing okay every six months i've got to change this filter or once a year i've got to change this filter as you do with your carbon monoxide as you do with a whole host of other things in your homes and make a part and parcel of an educational campaign a couple of you answered that mister you have a question a question so um look i agree with you that eliminating the source is always the best way but we have to be practical as well i was reading a texas a m a and m study and on corrosion especially with copper and lead piping and they recommend that one easy and um inexpensive way to uh reduce the the um possibility of lead in the water is to run the water and clear the lines and then the water that's coming in would have uh wouldn't have the lead in it because the lead is sitting in the water as a concentration because when it's corroding it sits when it crows it's not when it's running through the pipes itself so is is texas a m uh idea of running the water clearing the pipes a good one your opinion it's fairly routine for people to be advised to run their water if they're in a home that has lead pipes anything like that and you can do that even if there is treatment on on the supply difficulty there try doing that with a multi-family apartment complex something of that nature which of course you have a lot of in in our urban areas there's a lot of water sitting in those pipes and so one person running their faucet for a little while is not going to clear that water through so for a single family home yes feasible um waste a fair amount of water but it's absolutely feasible and from a health perspective might be the thing to do one question i had was this question of was when they do the testing talking to the dep they are doing a sort of statistical analysis of what's going on in an area now we've just heard uh that you know housing stock if i've built on this block and my builder or might have used um copper pi copper pipe with lead solder or somebody else might have used lead and that other neighborhood if so if you do spot test and get a statistical overlay your house your particular house may have an issue that won't show up in a statistical survey isn't that i mean that's got to be so so i'm concerned about that that that person who is not aware of the kind of pipe that they have in their particular home uh how do we make sure that that person um maybe you'll catch them for testing yes maybe not but how do we how what do we do how how should we change our testing regime our surveillance regime to make sure that because all of these things are devastating you get you've got 10 people that's you know if it's 32 000 a year times ten that's a lot of money and and worse than that is a it's a life that won't that might not very well reach its full potential because they might not get the three two thousand dollars but you you've done something systemically that's damaged that person so what do you what do you recommend that we do about those the idiosyncrasities that are not going to be picked up in a testing program that necessarily does you know sort of statistical analysis that says generally things are such but from myself or yourself you now have a problem that's not picked up in the testing so the action level isn't it and now you're sitting there with with an issue how do you deal with that there yes there are a couple of issues in there one is um even getting access to people's homes to do the testing by the water company so that they can be included within the statistical analysis that some people refuse to allow access so so you have that issue and then you have so there's something here's a note there that says we came to test war and you didn't let us in and so you could so they know at least what they're doing if they deny access yes so the the passaic valley water commission for instance has a program where they will do lead testing in somebody's home all you have to do is get in contact with them and they do it so you can do those kinds of programs where you essentially provide it as a free service the notion of of having an educational flyer or whatever that goes out to all of the customers within a utility service area the notion of in rental areas having the water tested prior to a new tenant company that needs to happen yeah so that's not an easy process no matter what there is without a doubt a certain level of personal responsibility that comes into this and the problem of course is that many people have no idea that they have that personal responsibility water is supposed to be safe well i never use the word safe when i'm talking about water i use the term it meets standards acceptable maybe i don't know dr rod you had something to add yeah i think kind of covered it basically the point is to try to get the utilities because a lot of new jersey we you know is still covered by um well water but the point of the well water is then at the point of a ceo of a sale basically to include that right now we do the radon and you see the the mortgage company says that you know if you're going to make a sale i want to see the rate on impact before i give you a mortgage same thing they can say you know we want to let impact before we give you the mortgage and you know that would be a way to to get the insurance company to pay for it or get the mortgage companies to pay for it i rented i rented a house recently and that was an issue and it was private well and it was it was it was very vexing i can tell you and it's one of the other reasons i'm very interested in this issue because i think uh rules need to be tightened up around these private wells quite frankly um particularly on these transfers and rentals in their life uh i want to move on if i can thank you doctors i appreciate it we have jeff tittle from the sierra club uh doug placa from denesso jim walsh food and water watch somebody else uh thank you jeff tiddle uh new jersey sierra club and i'll try not to um repeat uh anything that was said by any of the previous speakers because some of that stuff was some of the issues i wanted to touch base on i want to start off and say that you know we work many years ago with assemblyman geist at the time to get the private well testing bill passed and it was a way of trying to get into these homes where we're concerned and by the way the state of new jersey has not released the data from the private wealth testing act for the last five years which is something the health committee should look at because quite frankly a third of those well showed levels of contamination when we were actually getting the data the reason i wanted to start off with that because i think that's the kind of program that needs to be expanded into multi-families and and homes because the biggest problem we have in the state when it comes to lead in our drinking water are these pipes i watched across the street here when they dug up state street about 10 years ago and they brought up pipes that were from the victorian era they were basically wrought iron pipes that were drilled through logs that were cedar to help protect those pipes from you know buses or whatever back then probably horse and buggy point is we have a very old and aging infrastructure in new jersey in all of our urban areas in particular and in many of our older towns and those systems not only have lead in them there's other chemicals they also allow for infiltration of water into them because they're porous in places and it's a major problems at least an 8 billion dollar problem to fix a quarter of our water in urban areas leaks out of those pipes and we lose that and so one of the ways we could help pay for fixing some of these issues is baby recapturing that water and reselling it but the point i want to get back specifically to lead lead is a neurotoxin we know how horrible it is yet the state of new jersey the action level in drinking water is 15 parts per billion even though there's no safe standards when you're talking about children you know especially children who use a lot more water per pound than an adult we should not have any lead in our drinking water and it is a major problem and the problem is that in these older towns and communities we have lid pipes we have lead solder we have you know we have a system that's broken and we're not doing a proper enough job to test in those homes to make sure that that water is safe we have a great program in source water what's in the reservoir is what's coming out of the filtration plant but not at the end and that is a real problem and that has to get addressed and that's why i think expanding testing would be would be helpful but that's not the only thing one of the problems we also have is chloride chloride is used because we use a lot of chlorine in the state and chloride helps leech lead out of pipes that is a chemical fact and we use ortho phosphorus and other things to try to knock down you know the the ph so that there's less leaching but there's also health impacts from that as well so we have a system that's broken and the best way you know dean noel who is the chief engineer of the north jersey district water supply commission who i knew very well growing up since my family was up in ringwood said that the most cost effective and best way to have safe drinking water is to make sure it's pure in the first place and we really need to spend time fixing this aging infrastructure system but we also have other serious problems and i i know it's getting late so i just want to touch on them quickly the new jersey drinking water quality institute didn't meet for more than five years they haven't set a standard and dep hasn't adopted a new standard under this administration we have pefoa in wells in south jersey and gloucester county we have tce and pce in wells in morristown and yet we haven't adopted a standard the big problem we see also is that many of these problems could be cured especially on community systems with wells if we went to carbon filters it doesn't clean up the site but at least it'll make people healthier uh in the meantime and that's a real problem that we see here we also have a regulation in place that we don't have rules stricter than the feds well our drinking water should be at a million to one standard uh a big problem that we're facing in the state and that's why mentioned chloride before is teach is thm trihalomethane trihalomethane is a chemical die-off that happens when you use chlorine to treat uh waterways when there's a lot of bacteria in it and what happens is the chlorine kills it and this is a byproduct and in many parts of new jersey it is up in and around the epa health standard of 80 including lamberville where i live some water companies in order to try to knock down the thm levels throw ammonia in there which causes another series of health problems um and we have that problem in bergen county by the way and in and and and with uh e-town water in places too so we have a real serious water problem in the state and the health impacts because thm is carcinogenic and causes birth defects um we can move away from chlorine but we still will always use a certain amount in the pipes because they've been full of water in old pipes ozone treatment and reverse osmosis is very expensive so what we really need to look at is the overall water systems in new jersey when it comes to health we only have set standards on 100 chemicals just 3 000 out there so we have a broken problem in the state enforcement for water inspections are down almost 60 percent in the last six years so we don't even know what's happening in some of these places stay down i would say it's the philosophy of the department of environmental protection under this administration also loss of staff and we have wells there are 300 contaminated sites in new jersey that are directly impacting potable water supply wells and these are class c d sites these are very complex and dirty sites do you realize that the well field for the city of camden is in a place today you would be it would be illegal to draw to to drill a well it's called the categorical exemption area but because that well has been existing it's grandfathered and that's where penn station gets this water over camden same thing is true atlantic city and yet instead of fixing those welts those problems and cleaning up those or moving those wells you know we may be privatizing those water systems which will be a whole other set of problems i'm sure jim will talk about but the point i was trying to make is we have serious problems in the state when it comes to toxins getting into our water systems and not and not actually making sure that the sources themselves are safe in many parts of new jersey when we look at camden and i want to use that as an example when the tri-county pipeline was built it was supposed to go to replace camden's well field but instead we're shipping that water into the suburbs for growth and not putting it into the cities where it needs we have major problems when it comes to infrastructure and water quality and they're interrelated in the state and it's been a long time since anybody in this government has really spent time in addressing it and it's long overdue so i thank this committee for doing it and i just want to end with you know the old saying is this glass half empty or half full test the water before you drink it because you will never you won't know otherwise thank you full questions till the end and mr henry i think you don't want to make your way up and then we'll we'll move down the line mr walsh to get started as mr henry's moving his way uh great to see thank you very much chairman for stay over here in the middle so we can see thank you go ahead thank you chairman members of the committee for taking time to consider this uh really important issue um i'd like to lay out specifically some of the things that we saw happen in flint and uh food and water watch so folks know we have 19 offices across the country one of those offices and is in michigan and our staff is working in michigan um and has been working with residents and community organizations in flint around this issue um what happened in flint um goes back to a state takeover uh that happened in flint um where emergency managers were put in place to make decisions for the community and the decisions that were made in that state takeover essentially were to override a municipal decision uh were the municipalities yes sir flint is is a is a is a huge issue and i actually when that broke i actually sort of looked to see you know they actually meets criteria for for genocide if you look at what the un says it was a striking when you look at the things that happen but the reason i'm interrupting is this yes sir i i flinch if it's reference should we reference back to it i plan to do that sir it's actually really relevant and i'll later in my marks i'll talk about atlantic city and the things that are happening there right now as it relates to an emergency manager as well as a pending state takeover so it's very relevant where you had a somebody who is an outsider essentially making decisions about the water system the residents or the council in flint voted to hook up to a new water system that the county was putting in and that was then overridden by the emergency manager who hooked them up to the flint river and the flint river was more acidic and had very high levels um of a corrosive chlorine in it and or chloride in it and that caused iron to leach out of the system um and this then caused more the iron interacts with chlorine which then in inhibits the ability of the chlorine to treat the water which then had more the need for more chlorine to be added there's a uva study that actually looks at and and draws a link between this the chloride to sulfite ratio as being one of the major determining factors in uh whether or not you're going to have lead leaching out of pipes and so in this process we actually wound up they they wound up switching to this more acidic water they stopped using the phosphates in the water that they were using and started actually adding an iron chloride so that switch actually dramatically increased the amounts of uh chlorides in the water causing additional leaching and just a feedback loop that wind up having more and more leaching go forward and uh so this is you know really the result of looking to run a water system like a business um they remove local control on the decision making and there's actually an active cover-up going on or investigation going on right now and uh about uh the the inadequate testing and other things that were going on when we look at the problem moving forward and how this impacts new jersey we are going to have to spend a significant amount of money to actually fix this problem that there's no avoiding that what i want to talk about is how do we pay for it and these are very important decisions that we have to make if we don't put the resources publicly into actually paying for uh the the fixing of the ailing infrastructure we're going to continue to have problems like this in new jersey and elsewhere across the country and the federal government does provide some money and financing um through that we have available through the state revolving fund uh here in the state but that financing um is leaving tremendous amounts of money on the table every year there's inadequate money to actually deal with funding for pipes and those sorts of instructure a lot of the funding actually goes for water treatment facilities and things like that and so this really i think ask a question because if we don't provide the public money the only place that municipalities are going to have to turn is either dramatically increasing rates at the local level or looking at privatization and when they look at privatization they actually wind up paying a lot more in the long run but the upfront costs to the municipality appear to be lower and the reason there's a number of things that contribute to higher cost and privatization we just did a study comparing public and private uh utilities here in new jersey for providing water and found that private water companies actually charge about two thirds as much for water as public utilities do and that money is money that's essentially being skimmed off the top that could otherwise be used to provide further investment they they charge two thirds more that's that's correct sir that they said as much oh sorry two thirds more yes yes two thirds more by private companies charge two thirds more sorry thank you they charge two thirds more than public utilities which then uh you know essentially is skimming off the top the city of new brunswick just ended a management contract with a private water company that was costing the city about 850 000 a year now these are resources that could be invested back in the water system rather than essentially going to corporate you know ceo salaries and and things like that when um we look at atlantic city and what's happening there right now um with the takeover most a lot of the discussion right now is about what to do with the water system there uh there's been ongoing discussions in atlantic city for well over a year about uh that what to the the sale of the water system immediately after legislature passed a bill taking away the ability of communities to vote on water privatization contracts private water companies started showing up at atlantic city council meetings and working to push privatization there we worked with residents in atlantic city and community organizations to educate them about these problems with privatization now you have the mayor and council opposing this but what's happened is you actually have now a bill being proposed to bail out atlantic city but and a separate bill that will be uh proposed to deal with the takeover of the water system and that takeover bill will essentially force atlantic city to do what the mayor and council don't want to do and privatize the system and this is running into this dynamic where we want to you know run these water systems like and look at them as cash cows and look at them as as revenue sources the reality is they're not revenue sources uh what they are is is something that we we have in place to provide a basic human right to people and when you start thinking about them like business opportunities you make those decisions like we're done in flint to not hook up to the county system but to hook up to the flint river or to to not add phosphates because the price was going up and add other additives to those systems and so we need to look at these as a important human rights and working to ensure that those human rights um are maintained and and and so when you guys here in this committee are going to be probably voting on an atlantic city bailout bill in within the next month and when you vote on that there will be another bill attached to it there'll be it'll move as two bills is being proposed right now one that will actually provide resources through a pilot program to atlantic city and another that will propose the takeover and my biggest concern that happens is this takeover bill gets passed that forces a water privatization upon the city but then you also will have this other uh legislation that purports to provide aid to the municipality to support them and that bill has been vetoed by the governor it will probably be vetoed again but then he signs the takeover bill which will mean even more draconian measures will be necessary in atlantic city to actually stabilize the the economy there so i want to thank you all for your attention to this matter and thinking about this i think that there's a lot of investment that needs to be done in a lot of consideration about how we support struggling municipalities and provide resources to prepare to address water infrastructure needs in the state thank you michael and i yes sir it's amazing what happens when you but let me just say you mentioned how to pay for it yeah you mentioned what not to do yes sir okay and that was not to privatize wells that's right uh because of the uh because you begin to pay a lot more you say for um costs related to the sort of private aspect corporate costs and other things and that decisions might be modified in respect to these needs now to provide profit uh rather than uh that sort of than a profit that's just based to maintain the utility plus you know you know some build in for maintaining infrastructure and the like um is there quickly some so if we if we don't privatize what do we do to raise the money for now we i heard we stopped losing water okay like that's an idea anything else to add to that and how do we pay for it other than raising rates any other sure i think there's a number of things that mean that the state government could do to help to uh raise resources for this one is potentially looking at fees on bottled beverages other states charge fees as ways to uh actually induce recycling we could actually charge a fee on bottled beverage sales particularly even bottled water sales and there's um that could actually be used to fund uh public drinking water infrastructure and if you look at this from a standpoint of that bottled water sales are actually directly undermining our public drinking water system because we treat all of our water to a drinkable standard right or you know what is we consider drinkable but then we actually purchase bottled water and then drink that and use the entire rest of the house for bathing all these other things that aren't necessarily needing to be at a drinkable standard for watering our lawns and things like that so you could potentially put a fee on those beverages uh to help to increase money there's a the better choices coalition which we're a part of is provide proposing a number of measures that can be used to raise revenue in the state through looking at fair taxes and and uh fair tax system in the in the state of new jersey and raising taxes i think that also the state could look at creating a a looking at the current environmental infrastructure trust and there's money left on the table there that isn't getting to municipalities so potentially the state could have some power to come in and change uh to do things to incentivize municipalities to actually get money from that environmental trust or potentially if the federal requirements for that trust are to challenging so i've had many water purveyors tell me that the requirements for applications are challenging the state could actually create a side pot of money and that side pot of money could be used specifically to repair pipes and and and upgrade and maintain pipes thank you so i think that would be important mr flacco uh good good afternoon i guess now mr chairman committee members uh thank you for this we're used to it over here thank you for this opportunity to address you this morning you have copies of my comments so in the interest of brevity i will tailor those comments um for you this morning um i won't be uh citing statistical information i think um the previous speakers i've already done i i take that back i'll cite one statistic um we represent over five thousand nurses and hospital technicians throughout pennsylvania new jersey um we also represent included in that uh five thousand we represent the nurses at the city of newark's department of health and community wellness and i've asked to join me today uh therese calhoun who is janesso's community organizer but she's also the recent chair of newark's annual healthy homes lead awareness walk and i'll ask you just to say a few comments once i'm finished our membership partners with community organizations throughout the city of newark to bring awareness to this dangerous reality providing information about ways to reduce children's exposure and risk factors encouraging parents to understand the history of the buildings in which they live and raise their families particularly if they're considering any home improvements or renovation it's an important step in this process this helps parents take take the necessary precautions to protect their families before undertaking any project that might put their children at risk educating the public about best practices to prevent lead exposure also includes simple reminders of regular hand washing cleaning children's toys frequently and keeping children away from bare soil when playing outdoors it also involves providing parents the information about how to store food and liquid in lead-free containers as well as how to minimize risks when preparing baby formula for young children our membership also participates in newark's annual healthy homes led awareness walk which seeks to raise awareness throughout the city and again and gain the attention of families who may be at risk of lead exposure in their homes and such efforts have touched the lives of many families throughout the city so if there are other ways for this body to explore as to how to educate the public by all means we are certainly willing to stand by and help in any way possible newark just being one stop that's where we have our member where we represent our members so i'd just like to ask therese to just talk about what it is in her experience as the chair of the healthy homes lead awareness walk good afternoon everyone thank you for allowing me to just address you on this very important issue push your mic on man my throat is a little scratchy my name is therese calhoun community organizer at genesa one of my roles and responsibilities as a geneseo employee is to build relationships and collaborate with other stakeholders to address health care issues relevant to our members and the patient populations that they serve in 2014 i was assigned to the city of north just like mr placa said janessa represents the city of newark public health nurses including nurses that are lead educators early in this assignment i connected with various organizations that over the years have been educating the community of the dangers of lead and advocating for the families of children that were affected by lead at one of the meetings the idea of a lead awareness was discussed and i was asked to chair i accept it on september 14 2014 we organized the first annual lead awareness walk the lead awareness walk consisted of children from local day cares speeches speeches from genesso leadership elected officials and other community leaders vendors provided information and resources that were sent home with the children as it pertains to lead hazards and precautionary methods methods children entertainment consisted of face painting and a cartoonist because we had to entertain of course the kids there was a lot there was light refreshments for everyone two weeks later the group met and we were told that the parents were taken back by what they were reading they thought lead was dead they expressed appreciation for the information and began acting on what they learned it is fair to say that the walk was a success this is just one of the many approaches to bringing awareness of the dangers of lead and how to avoid exposure what i learned thus far lead is not dead children are still being poisoned with lead education education education testing mandated for children entering schools child care centers should be is a must there are so many other things i want to talk about but so the other speakers did address it so i want to thank you thank you for uh the information provided uh mr uh henry please close this out yes uh thank you very much uh chairman and committee and thanks for allowing me to testify um basically um i represent the new jersey uh association of county and city health officials so we're approximately 92 health departments that represent the 8 million people in the state so basically i'm not going to repeat anything that my colleagues had basically said but basically last night when i was looking for this this is the whole annual report from 2014 from the state health department on childhood lead poisoning in new jersey so i mean that has all the data very easy for me to download from the state website actually to uh discuss some of these issues and briefly i'll just say that you know obviously lead in the water is a concern to us and we're involved in basically the whole um area of lead prevention and lead poisoning like my colleague from newark was basically saying i mean education is is an important piece uh intervention is an important piece also the issue that we we our action level or actionable level is that 10 deca leaders 10 micrograms per deca leader is where we start our environmental interventions so we do get the lead data from the the physicians and the public health agencies and clinics uh indicating elevated lead levels when we get those levels we go right in and work on those issues right away either for doing lead analysis uh finding out if their water supply is good we do the whole uh area it can be very challenging because some of the cases are trying to abate uh lead hazards can take up to a year or more to do depending on how cooperative the landlords are how you want to take landlords to court and how long that takes i mean it can be extraordinarily challenging also in the audience is one of my colleagues from the monmouth county health department and they work as well as newark and and other municipalities and and counties on healthy homes trying to educate and i think also the the monmouth county is also has the same the hurricane sandy led abatement program as well where they're actually trying to increase the level of testing that goes on in the state you know and uh i'll echo my colleague from newark basically saying that there's more testing that needs needs to be done in children if you want to find out whether where the addition of the problems are i mean the more testing the better and and uh when we get the data we just go to work um in those areas also the state has something called less tracks so if the number if the uh elevated lead levels are found they go into a system called lead tracks that we enter data in and and we we watch that uh data as well obviously it's protected by hipaa so a lot of times people won't get the data from this but the data really ends up in here in the annual report and we we work on it from that standpoint uh also again i wanted to also talk about that uh we work at that ten level um and actually in these reports you can see the number of kids that are between five and nine um and going to that level if the state or or if the committee is is looking to go to that level uh uh to to a lower level or actionable level we as local public health are facing the same challenges as municipalities and counties if you want us to address those three to five thousand more children in that level we we need some additional funding to actually uh do that from just from the equipment standpoint and the personnel standpoint i can tell you personally since i represent 22 local health departments in my health department at the regional health commission in monmouth county we lend our meters out uh in the shared services type of way so there are ways to economically do this you know and what meter is this system it's a lead analyzer checking for homes for lead dust lead paint things along those lines um but you know but those are those are our uh areas that we can do so um the lead plumbing in in the pipes it has been talked about lead abatements are ongoing and there are a variety of of of levels of lead abatements throughout the state and throughout the cities and uh basically somebody mentioned about uh prenatal education uh you know there's a lot of education going on i know i i i also am on the board of the central jersey family um health consortium as well they do a lot of data and a lot of information in regards to uh prenatal services and prenatal work and pre-natal education i think what happens is to invite and uh start dialoguing with those consortium members to find out what additional efforts can be made to do more education at the prenatal level and more testing at the pre-k level testing at the at the kindergarten level and basically we see the laboratory we see the lead laboratory results we see the private well testing data as well i mean i can tell you i i get maybe out of my 22 towns i get maybe one or two of those private well testing results coming through my office at least once or twice a week and then we pass that on any exceedance which includes lead you know we passed that on to uh try and get abated but basically i'm i'm i'm thankful that you have allowed us to testify today and uh the the our association is more than willing to work um with all of our colleagues to make it better for um our children in the state of new jersey and basically thanks thank you very much now anybody else out there on water quality that perhaps knew and didn't put a slip in um chairman i have mr one other funding uh thought for you um just uh last year uh the state of new jersey um uh awarded american water uh 164 million dollars to move their headquarters from voorhees to camden and programs that are going to allow those sorts of public resources to be doled out for a very profitable water company that is charging exceptionally high rates is certainly misappropriated funds and any money in this year's budget that's in that ada program that could be allocated otherwise should be cut and put into social programs increasing our water infrastructure and things like that thank you getting your looks in there just that there's money in this year's budget that's being diverted from the 1981 uh water quality bond act that was passed and every year for the last 20 years about eight million dollars gets taken out and taken to dep for salaries and that's money that could have actually gone out to help towns and i think we tend to forget that we're just but my point is that in the fact that the new jersey water supply master plan uh which is supposed to be done every five years was last done in 1995 is another name that we have when it comes to the light side on us so anyway mr use this mr peterson thank you all for your testimony um one of the things i think is important is to uh remind everybody that the cdc recommendation is five new jersey's operating on 10. i think it's irresponsible for us to move forward and leave it at 10 and hopefully we'll do something about that and if we're talking about water water quality uh you brought up tricoral methane and and most recently perfluorooctanoic acid pfla is found in several places in new jersey new jersey did fund a study in ridgewood new jersey up by us i think 12 million no 1.2 million dollars i'm sorry and uh this has been going on for a couple years and i think we need to see the results of the study and add these toxins to our list and hopefully we'll be able to as we talk about water quality we'll be able to talk about newer not really newer this was a teflon additive but as these things crop up we should add them and move forward and make sure that these aren't affecting our children and and i believe this is a crisis if you're talking about 3 000 children in the state of new jersey if that were our children i think we would stand up and run for the doors and make sure something happened that's it well you're right and then when you have parts of the water uh infrastructure that just have been prevented from doing their job uh it's a problem uh because we can't get these new um we can't get these new standards put in place uh when they're needed mr peterson i have a question from mr tittle you said that the camden city well is is in a location where um the water being drawn out of it is toxic it's a what's called a categorical exemption area in the dep which means that you cannot drill a new well there but it's grandfathered in even though it's a contaminated site absolutely is the water contaminated well um they have filters on it and things like that the question is what gets through i mean there's a there's been a class-action suit by citizens in camden over the years against the water uh authority there uh because of the contamination this is the second time they've actually moved their well so they have a serious problem there and because we don't test remember we only test for and have standards set for about 100 chemicals other chemicals that may be in the water we do not have standards for therefore if they're there like tce and pce unless they're a certain level they go through and and that's the same with atlantic city yes atlantic city's wealth field is also in a contaminated area not as contaminated but it's near a toxic site so they have problems there too we have a lot of wells in new jersey what people don't realize that one of the reasons the highlands has become so important as you well know for water supply especially spruce run around valley reservoir we've closed more than a thousand potable water supply wells in new jersey in the last 25 years because of contamination we even had one this is going to sound really hard to believe up until a few years ago where the garden state parkway and route 22 is we actually had a portable well there from e town so we have a serious problem new jersey where we may be the first state east of the rockies to run out of water ours is because of over development and for and because of contamination i mean we really have a serious problem long term in new jersey with contamination our groundwater into our wells and and both the camden and the atlantic city systems are currently run by a government you know we believe in whether it's a public system or a private system you need the state to have to be a watchdog and to do testing we tend to think that there are problems with public systems we've had people in east orange and other places go to jail for falsifying reports if there's political pressure to look the other way it doesn't matter if it's public we've also seen in indiana and other places private systems where they've been indicted we believe a public system is more accountable because you can go to your you can go to your council member and yell at them if there's a problem or you can go to your government you know your town hall so we think public systems are held a lot more accountable we think north jersey water supply commission is more accountable to the people than let's say you know um uh united ward well united water which is headquartered in france you know it's a little bit easier to go to your council meeting and yell at them versus trying to go to france they have sovereign immunity private companies well let's just put it this way um there are a lot of problems with with um with being able to get accountability from private companies especially when they're headquartered in you know overseas or out of state well in in lambertville where you live correctly united water yes yep so and and that was sold uh several years ago and part of that was because the water the government water company was under capitalizing couldn't fix the dam that was going to breach and flood the town yep um so uh government run water companies are no panacea of goodness either so i will say um that that water has high levels of thm and when i have a chance i'm going to go yell at mayor dave about it um the other thing is that the money to fix the dam actually came from public money so um well they probably what was what was the source of the money uh they they got it out of the um the state uh infrastructure trust but there was other infrastructure problems other than the dam that was with that whole system that had to be yeah i was just because i was almost had to evacuate so i do know that damn quite well yeah i was and now they want to put a pipeline through it but that's another story well all right um so um now for sake of time i'm going to end it there okay well um i am um i thank the committee for the patience in getting through this we have had some long meetings as you know actually thought we might be able to do this in the afternoon but i guess it's it's um good that we've been able to run straight through to it and um at least a late lunch if nothing better i appreciate the indulgence of all of you to stay here and listen to a testimony and look forward to your efforts and our collective efforts to address what is a serious concern for the state of new jersey thank you we're adjourned [Music]
O3FKuoQQuhQ,NJ,06-01-2017,okay [Music] yes good afternoon to everyone we get the back door closed please let me welcome all of you to this uh scheduled meeting of the appropriations um committee uh we have a substitution today assemblyman demaio is not able to make it uh assembly speaker prieto has informed us that nancy assemblywoman nancy munez is with us hello assembly woman welcome we're going to pass that on for the record thank you uh before we do a roll call uh for those who are attending the appropriations committee for the first time let me go over how we like to conduct these meetings this is what's referred in often cases is a second reference committee which means bills that have cleared previous committees come here because they have a financial component of some kind and therefore we take up that issue on those bills that are second reference to this committee we will only be talking about issues related to the appropriations or if there's an amendment to the bill we will only talk about the amendment to the bill we will not re-litigate the details of the bill we rely on our colleagues who handled the bill in the appropriate committee in front of us we rely on their work now for those who have an interest in an issue uh they will direct you back to the sponsors so you can work with them in advance of it going to the floor so the discussion becomes narrow any testimony that's given today we ask that it be contained in the three-minute range uh if you have written testimony we request that be submitted so we have that for the record and the members do read that and it is very valuable so that being said the only addition the only additional comment i have is uh the state of new jersey like many states across the nation continues to have its financial issues so today we will move bills through that often have a financial component that doesn't mean we have the money to do it what it means is we are simply establishing a list of what we'd like to have excuse me enacted if in fact money should become available so i don't want any of you to think that we are just spending because we think we have money we understand how tight things are but we proceed along the lines and hopefully one day things get a little bit better our money presents itself or the issue requires so we can act that being said again i thank all of you for being here i'll answer the roll call be made miss munoz here miss phoebus miss trapezy miss carraday mr conaway he's here miss lampet yeah miss mascara is absent i'm sorry miss mascara she's somewhere yes miss quijano is absent i will miss her mr cher is also absent we'll miss him too mr lagana chairman versus kelly thank you i've been informed that uh bill number a4441 is being held that will not be heard today the bills will be read by title only and we'll move on the first bill as for the title record of will be a four eight eight zero assembly bill number a4880 amends the law to limit the department of environmental protections direct oversight of the remediation of a portion of a contaminated site under certain circumstances thank you uh we have um jeff kolakowski new jersey builders association in favor and i need to testify uh thank you jeff theodore schwartz morris companies in favor mr schwartz do you have need to testify can you be brief sir please come forward and you have written testimony for us and as you're sitting this bill is sponsored by a assemblywoman prieto and assemblywoman who mendes uh mr schwartz welcome you have three minutes sir okay thank you mr chairman members of the committee my name is theodore schwartz i'm here on behalf of the morris companies and of support of the amendment to the site remediation act which will provide a more practical and reasonable approach to brownfield's redevelopment projects currently the dep in site remediation can issue what is known as a direct oversight letter and that letter will affect the entire development of a site even though parts of the site are under remediation and i'm going to give you a perfect example and to why i'm really here today presently the largest project in this commercial project in the state of new jersey is being developed in kearney new jersey uh on what is known as the copper's coke tract this project is a billion dollar construction project which involves mars companies with two million square feet of warehouse space and new jersey transit with a resiliency project in response to the issues that occurred during sandy so it's going to provide all the electrical energy in northern new jersey to the rail tracks and the site consists of 175 acres and 135 are upland the rest is by what they call riparian the mars companies is not the responsible party for cleanup of the site but it's another company called beezer and the dp is has issued a direct oversight letter because beezer still has allegedly some work to do in the river so what we asked the dp to do is can you bifurcate the site and let the upland site be developed where this project is going to go on which will provide employment to thousands of people on a temporary and permanent basis and provide over a billion dollars in economic benefit to the region the project has also been declared to be a vital project by the new jersey sports and exposition authority it's supported by two united states senators congressional delegation every single union in the area because of the enormous impact from an economic perspective so what we're trying to do is to correct the site remediation act so that where there's a direct oversight letter issued if there's a point of the site that's already under remediation that that site would be affected under the site remediation act the lsrp a licensed site remediation professional manages the remediation once a direct oversight letter was issued by the dep and they usually issued because the rps is not doing their job but in this case the upland part of the site is pretty well done we just have to build the hardscape the warehouses parking lots and so on and so forth so we asked the dp if they would separate the site out they said under the law they don't feel that they can that the entire site has to be effective so this amendment will help bring on you know redevelopment in these brownfield sites where remediation has taken place that's basically the gist of it schwartz that's uh it's very concise by the way i think this is a good approach right you supported the uh the license plate professional side you did that in under three minutes by the way uh which brings extra credence to your message being being as strong as it was any questions for mr schwartz uh seeing none thank you sir uh we have no one else scheduled to testify the chair entertain a motion to release motion made second heard we'll have a roll call on a four eight eight zero miss munoz yes miss phoebus yes miss trapezy miss caraday miss mr conaway he's an affirmative miss slampit yes miss mascara mr laganna chairman versus kelly yes bill is released thank you mr schwartz for your testimony very helpful we'll now have the title on a4870 please assembly bill number 4870 zero establishes the safe transportation jobs and fair employment rules act thank you this bill is sponsored by assembly speaker prieto speaker emeritus oliver assemblywoman keanu and assemblywoman pinter marin somebody would share something with valerie hudsold's quite a list along with a number of co-sponsors i'm just checking through the uh through the notes here we have a number of people that have signed in in favor of no need to testify we have some people who have signed in to testify both for and against we will start with uh uh tony russo please commerce and industry association new jersey and also like to bring up mike wallace njbia uh both have checked the opposition uh would you both care to testify mike coming up come on up michael how about tony is tony coming or is he going to just leave you all by yourself well i think you're a good company by the way michael welcome uh do you supplies with written testimony as well okay thank you mike if you can uh it's all yours you got three minutes sir thank you chairman and members of the committee my name is mike wallace of the new jersey business and industry association and on behalf of our 20 000 members and their 1.2 million employees i'm here to testify in opposition to assembly goal 4870 the bill would circumvent the collective bargaining process by imposing wage and benefit increases for service workers at newark liberty airport newark penn station and the hoboken terminal wages and benefits that are typically awarded through contract negotiations under the bill the minimum wage for subcontracted service workers would be increased to 17.98 and include the following fringe benefits 4.27 supplemental wages for health and welfare one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours work up to 56 hours of paid sick leave a year which is conflicting to the current newark municipal paid sick league ordinance a minimum of 11 paid holidays and an increasing number of paid vacation days starting at two weeks with one year service and increasing the five weeks after 25 years of service increasing the minimum wage represents 110 increase and nearly 300 percent increase if you include the fringe benefits this increase would be a huge hit on businesses that may already be running on thin profit margins the legislation would also create a two-tiered unfair compensation system for those businesses located in transportation centers and those who are not a business at one of the three transportation centers included in the bill would pay 22.25 cents an hour while those located outside of those centers could pay a minimum wage of eight dollars and 44 cents in conclusion i respectfully ask many members to vote no on this bill today and i thank you for the opportunity to testify michael thank you testimony well done any questions for the uh individual thank you michael thank you again you submitted testimony to us correct second call for tony russo to tony make it back in the room we'll put that aside for the moment i'd like to call this next group up as a panel these are the people have signed up in favor and by the way in addition to that i'll give the ols will reflect those who have signed up and testified both for and against the official record and reflect that although we won't call them out uh i have a kevin brown vice president of state director suie kevin are you here kevin come on up please thank you i hope that's not your testimony you're going to give us today thank you uh and i have i'm going to mispronounce his first name the last name looks like it's spelled g-a-o is that do i have it correctly i'm sorry national employment law project how do you pronounce your first name thank you welcome to you and uh i have another one uh zaqui medina newark airport workers contracted by airserve i know i'm just pronounced that first name is that individual here you made it very good thank you and how about pastor ronald tough right pastor are you here thank you sir please come forward now i'll ask you uh and and it's always we'll ask that as you provide the testimony for the committee uh that you attempt not to be repetitive of the person in front of you uh we ask you to make your point and help us in understanding this and uh i would say to you that the sooner you finish the sooner we vote so now pastor i know asking a pastor to be contained and speaking is a big request but since there is no collection plate we hope that you'd be able to contain things so who did i call first who would i ask for who'd like to go first pastor you want to go first pastor welcome to you sir you have three minutes but by the way praying for all of us you have as much time as you like but on the testimony side you have three minutes first of all good afternoon my name is reverend ronald tuff i am the associate pastor of first bethel baptist church irvington new jersey and i also serve as second vice chair of new jersey black issues convention as clergy and community activities we see devastating impact of poverty as on people in our communities many of these hard-working families struggle to put food on the table even though they work full-time jobs among them are thousands of contracted workers at newark airport who make so little money a significant number of them are forced to rely on food stamps and other taxpayer-funded programs in order to feed their families not only are these workers living on the brink from paycheck to paycheck some employees at north libya international airport are homeless and living in a shelter shouldn't people who work for a living be able to make a living most contracted newark airport workers make about ten dollars and twenty cents per hour that doesn't add up too much if you do the math about twenty two thousand dollars a year which is less than the federal property level for a family of four this figures even more alarming if you consider a worker that needs reconsider worker needs to earn at least 25 dollars now in order to afford a decent two-bedroom apartment in new jersey according to a report by the national low-income housing coalition import jobs used to be good jobs but that has changed since airlines started contracting out vital services to the lowest bidder some are irresponsible contractors like prime flight aviation services was contracts with united airlines at north liberty international airport and 48 other airports across the country it is ironic that a company that identifies itself as god-centered and faith-based also has a troubling record of osha health and safety citations as well as wage and hour claims this race to the bottom fueled by outgoing is isn't just hurting airport workers it also hurts families and communities when workers can't afford the basics they don't have money to spend in this local economy and since newark airport is one of the largest work sites in the state providing thousands of jobs these jobs need to be good jobs that that can sustain families finally there is a solution the staffer act will ensure our safe transportation jobs and fair import employment the rules act will ensure that thousands of privately subcontract airport train and ferry workers who work at major transportation hubs receive the same wages and benefits as government contracted unarmed security officers these workers deserve a living wage they put themselves at risk every day all they ask every turn is to live with dignity and have the wages and benefits they need to provide for their families so i urge you please support the staffer act please consider your constituents they deserve to have a more decent wage but also a decent life thank you so much mr thank you well spoken as expected by the way well done thank you uh who would like to speak next night you got a tough act to follow so we don't know the pastor actually laid out some very important salient points in this argument so we don't necessarily have to hear them again even though our attention span as legislators is not real good uh that was impactful so uh if you give us your name for the record and can you add to what the pastor said as opposed to repeating what he said sure alex i'm going to be expanding on the low road outsourcing point thank you my name is kaylee gao and i'm a staff attorney with the national employment law project or knelp nelp is a non-profit nonpartisan research organization specializing in labor and employment policy our staff members are recognized as policy experts in areas like wagener enforcement minimum wage policy and the negative effects of low road outsourcing outsourcing occurs when a company such as an airline train or bus company takes work that was performed by directly hired employees and subcontracts that work to another firm who then hires the employees research shows that the increasing number of workers in these contracted jobs creates a race to the bottom where companies are incentivized to bid against one another to provide cheaper and cheaper contracts this model is growing as nelp reports show it is one of the main factors driving low wages and poor working conditions in our economy today and it is exemplified in the transportation hubs that are the subject of this bill research studies of airports show that outsourcing has dramatically increased in recent decades and as a result wages at airports have not only stagnated they have actually decreased in our nation's airports um between the areas 2012 2002 and 2012 the percentage of baggage boarders uh who were subcontracted uh has had tripled um from 25 to 84 during that time wages also decreased from an average of 19 to an average of 10 dollars and 60 cents what used to be middle class jobs are now outsourced to poverty jobs these low wages also mean high turnover of the workforce one study showed that the low wages paid by an airline contractor were linked to annual turnover as high as 80 percent studies show that high turnover means less experienced workers with less training higher wages on the other hand are associated with low turnover and more experienced and trained workers research shows that this affects the safety and quality of service in one of nov's reports of on the philadelphia airport we quote an airport security contractor we quote an airport security contractor excuse me the day after september 11th he told a reporter we were under bid in contract after contract the rates they wanted us to come in at were untenable the race to the bottom incentivizes subcontracted firms to cut corners as to workers and as the safety standards it is also appropriate for the state to establish minimum standards for services that are privately contracted at these sensitive locations such as airports train stations bus stations or ferry terminals the state of new jersey has already provided a corrective to the race to the bottom in its own service contracts through the establishment of prevailing wage requirements for example when new jersey transit contracts for services at newark penn or at hoboken terminal it follows the prevailing wage law the proposed legislation would help close this gap that exists for workers performing services on contracts between private entities at these sensitive transport locations um for all these reasons and as stated further in my written testimony we believe that a4870 is good policy energy to support it thank you and thank you and um thank you for thank you for that testimony and thank you for your consideration at the time factor greatly appreciated who'd like to go next now your job gets tougher because you've had two very very distinguished speakers in front of you so you've got to come up with something different or you're not going to need three minutes and we're going to if you would turn your mic off the previous speaker yes thank you and your name for the record sir zaki you're on the clock for three minutes all right well first of all i'd like to start off by saying good afternoon everyone good afternoon to you i work at newark airport as a security officer under a contractor called airsoft airserve so i'm truly on the front lines especially with many threat shootings and attacks at the airports across the globe i take this job very seriously and i always put safety first but i make little money i make just about 10 20 per hour that's about twenty two thousand per year as was stated before by the pastor and it's not just me thousands of other privately contract airport workers at our region's airports are struggling to survive because airlines have outsourced jobs to the low-baid contractors who have pushed down wages and provided little or no benefits also troubling is the wage disparity that currently exists at airports in the metropolitan area those of us who work at newark airport do the same jobs as airport workers in laguardia and jfk but we make less money that's because new york airport workers recently got a modest pay hike and are on the path to earn 15 because new york state's new minimum wage law a two-tier wage scale devalues our work and regulates contract airport workers as second-class citizens the legislation you are considering can change that reality for us so with the state for act bill safe transportation jobs and fair employment rules will ensure that thousands of privately subcontract airport workers trains and ferry workers who work at majority transportation hubs receive the same wage and benefits as government contract under unarmed security officers not only do we deserve this wage because of the vital role we play in keeping the airports safe and clean higher wage reduce turnovers as well so please take action soon thank you thank you well done by the way i appreciate your service in the uh and the security side of things it's always a pleasure and by the way i mean the fact that collectively you've had to come to the legislature for this relief is disappointing for the people you work for would not respect more the value that you provide dave you're going to close out the pro side kevin rather going to close out the pro side um you're going to sure see what you have to say because you've got to follow a pass or another group so you've got to give us something different than we heard i promise chairman i will keep it extremely short i appreciate the opportunity to testify today [Music] on behalf of the staffer act a4870 32bj seiu we represent 163 000 memps property service workers up and down the east coast 11 500 of them working here in new jersey including office cleaners school maintenance and food service workers residential workers security officers and now also more than fifteen hundred airport workers uh this when the state contracts for security at hoboken terminal they ensure that the workers they are paid a minimum of 17.98 an hour plus four dollars and 27 cents an hour so that when we go to the hoboken terminal nothing bad happens to us we need those eyes and ears kevin unless you're riding on new jersey transit in the terminal um yes uh but that's an important safety feature to make sure that we have those eyes and ears when the port authority of new york and new jersey directly contracts for security at the newark airport they make sure that those workers are paid a minimum of 17.98 plus healthcare however when the airlines who are right now making uh last year more than 12 billion dollars in profits in the united states the previous speaker against forgot to include that they can afford to make sure and they need to make sure that we are safe and secure at the airport and as the inspector figaro told me the most important and their biggest fear at newark airport is another lax or another fort lauderdale we don't need that and he would appreciate and the port authority police would appreciate another ten thousand pairs of eyes and ears to make sure that we are safe and secure just like what happened in belgium the airport workers there helped to make sure that those as many people as possible were safe and secure this additional wage compensation and benefits would help to make sure the people are safe are safely taken care of who take care of us each and every day and we would appreciate if you would support this bill and vote yes to make sure that these workers have a living wage and benefits thank you so much and i have like to submit testimony uh lengthier's testimony of then i spoke today as well as a petition signed by almost 700 of the airport workers uh asking for your support for this thank you so much oh thank you kevin any questions for the panel seeing none thank you folks collectively and i'm telling you it bothers me you even have to be here to do this you mentioned the profits of the airlines last year they fought tooth and nail didn't want to pay tax on their fuel they were buying when they were on the ground so so tight we're going to vote here shortly tony rousseau i see you in the room tony you want to jump in i know you're going to bring us very favorable comments and encouragement depends on your view how's somebody's focus here sorry mr chairman i know i was down on another committee but uh good afternoon my name is tony we understand where we rank in priority since you were elsewhere sorry mr chairman we still called on you but i i will uh be brief but um i'm tony rousson president of the commerce and industry association we represent about 900 different companies from virtually every business sector we're based in paramus but we also have an office here in trenton the reason why we're opposed to this is we think it's unfair when you target when a legislature targets a specific workforce and and mandates a higher pay uh we understand that other states have tried to do something similar and it was tabled uh so we just uh we really oppose this just from an ideological perspective that um you know this is a slippery slope to go down uh and and honestly the uh from what we've been told the workers are getting paid higher than other airports and the newark airport is an economic engine for this area so uh we urge everybody to vote now on the legislation thank you tony any questions tony seeing none thank you tony very good the chair will entertain a motion to release motion made second heard roll call please what is your name sir uh did you supply written testimony do you wish to add to that please come forward i don't have slips for you but we'll have you speak one two one one person how many people i'm sure you will thank you uh thank you good afternoon mr chairman and member of the committee my name is sean williams i'm with airlines for america my colleague rob delucia also with airlines for america we submitted testimony that is definitely longer than three minutes and so i will be summarizing that briefly for you and happy to entertain questions we respectfully oppose the legislation i want to point out two things that are important to note one is that airlines are fully compliant with all state and local wage and labor laws and so is not a discrepancy about that number two i think it's important to note that we do not take a position on what the statewide minimum wage should be there have been efforts in this state and other states and many years over the past many years to increase the minimum wage applicable to all state employees all employees in the state rather we do not take a position on that you haven't seen us here in the building we don't get involved in those fights we don't get involved in them in them in new jersey we don't get involved in them anywhere um throughout the country we we take no position on what that rate should be if this if the legislature and the governor determine that it should be a certain amount then then we will comply with that um but if people think that it is necessary for some employees to receive a higher wage rate we believe that it's important for all employees to be the beneficiary of that higher wage rate not just a targeted industry not just a small group of employees and that is what's being proposed here in in the legislation you could very well have some neighbors people who live in the same neighborhood who do very similar work for different companies some at the airport some not at the airport they have the same living conditions living in the same neighborhood the same cost of living living in the same neighborhood and some of them get the benefit of a state law that gives that favors one group of those employees some of those neighbors over another group of those neighbors and so that is our primary objection there's several legal considerations by the way that you can review and perhaps your uh staffs and your staff attorneys may want to take a look at that i think we've raised that may be of interest to you but we have as a very serious concern that you're segregating out or targeting one group of employees one group of employers over another group of employees and another group of employers the [Music] package that's being proposed here 17.98 cents an hour plus benefits i believe and you know assuming another five dollars uh in benefits that's 23 an hour which is substantially higher than any neighboring airport almost double in some cases um and so we think that if you're going to apply that benefit to some employees you should apply it to all um so with that i i will wrap up our comments we are certainly happy to answer questions or have follow-up conversations if needed thank you sir thank you thank you for your testimony any questions sally please um understanding that you're here today and understanding that i you probably have had internal discussions in the event that we do pass this what's the intention are you going to pass that along to the consumers would you absorb it would we now see additional you know costs for you know bringing a purse onto a plane how how do you intend if this goes through where would the money come from i can't speak on behalf of our members because we're not an airline we're an association of the airlines and so i don't we for a variety of reasons not the least of which is um anti-trust reasons we don't get involved in those discussions about pricing and that sort of thing i can only tell you what what i think is obvious to a lot of us and that is that that you increase cost substantially on any business or any industry um you're putting upward pressure on on the price of that product of that service and so uh you know whether it's this or you know jet fuels mentioned earlier there's there's in any industry it's not just airlines if you increase costs you're putting upward pressure on the product of the service and as a follow-up have your clients had good faith discussions on this issue prior to it rising to a level of us being asked to put forth you know legislation that most states don't have actually that's a good point i meant to mention that earlier there's other states that have entertained this but because of the serious legal and policy implications of it um massachusetts and oregon most recently in the last few years have rejected a proposal like this so thank you for reminding me i'm not sure what you asked what you're asking about have had discussions they have had a lot of discussions about this and we we regularly talk about we re-vet what our policies are what our positions on different policies are and we talk about this regularly and our position remains i think it's fairly unique in the business world our position remains that we don't oppose statewide minimum wage increases that apply to everyone no that's not the question it's a function of newark airport the airlines coming out of newark airport have historically had amongst the highest fares in the entire country the pricing the particular airport you know i'm not a big fan of the spell but i'm also not a big fan of what your clients have been doing and so it's more a function of trying to understand you know there's got to be some give and take in those discussions and if you really have a whole group of employees that is coming to us saying that we're not getting fair wages and we're getting no response amongst a group of carriers who charge amongst the highest rate fares in the entire country there seems to be a really big disconnect well we we advocate as i said earlier we can only advocate on policy and not get involved in the fair discussion with our members it's very you know strictly regulated we're we are at a4 are constantly reminded that we can't have those discussions with our members i would only point out to you i think it's included in the letter that i submitted although i'm not sure if that was distributed with the discrepancy we had earlier but i'll get it to if it hasn't been newark also has amongst every airport in the country the highest cost per in plane passenger um it is the most expensive airport bar none in the country uh for airlines to do business so that that i mean again when you put upward pressure on on businesses like this you put upward pressure on costs um you know it's natural to understand as a general matter that that that unfortunately prices increase that's just the way that it is if we don't have that can you provide that breakdown yeah i we we i have somewhere in this room 25 copies of a letter um and it includes that chart it's a it's a chart by the american uh transport uh research transportation society so we'll get it to you it's the atrs report uh vice chairman uh logano joe thank you mr chairman uh the your organization's airlines for america correct what airlines do you represent i meant to go over that earlier i was trying to keep under three minutes um we're the oldest and largest trade association of domestic passenger and cargo carriers in the country specifically the members are american united jet blue southwest alaska hawaiian ups fedex and a cargo company called atlas thank you thank you vice chairman thank you sir thank you for your testimony uh seeing no one else chair entertain a motion the motion was actually made and second to release the chair will call for a roll call please to release a4870 miss munoz miss phoebus i just have a comment before i vote which is i think it's a very sad state when these airlines cannot settle this uh with their employees and that we are sitting here today having to make this vote on something that should never have gotten this far and i think it's a very very sad statement on the employee relationship with these airlines but saying so i i am going to vote no mr peasy i share a lot of the same feelings um this is something where i'm going to continue to look into it and i believe that there's got to be a better way for the airlines to deal with their employees as well as a better way to figure out why our particular airport out of any airport in the entire country is the most expensive airport to do business with um for the moment i'm gonna know but i i would like to definitely get more involved in this issue so thank you thank you so much woman miss carradine yes mr conaway he's an affirmative mr conway left a vote in the affirmative miss lampet yes miss mascara yes mr laganna chairman versus kelly before i vote let me add this uh particularly to those who testified last uh airport environments are very unique they are almost a city to themselves it's a place where soft drinks and alcoholic beverages cost extraordinarily high prices where other things associated with visiting there are out of whack with what would be the general neighborhood prices these are unique places providing a unique service and the people that work there out of frustration have had to come to the state legislature to get relief so that they have a little better treatment and can make a little better living while the people they work for are flourishing and doing very well and by the way we collectively and i'd say we i mean i don't begrudge airlines for being profitable i prefer they'd be more civilized to fly on i prefer they be more genteel and how they conduct themselves but that's all their choices but within the reach of this legislature is to do these kinds of laws when its citizens comes to it for relief so that being said i vote yes the bill is released and moves on to the general assembly for consideration thank you we'll have the title record please on a one four five two we are now on bills that are all second reference and only debate on amendments or the appropriations portions of the bills will be considered assembly bill number 1452 establishes the lactation consultants licensing act thank you let me let me clear the cards here and see who is where we have three individuals that have chosen

can you keep your testimony there are no members on this bill again there are no amendments we like your comments with regards to how it affects appropriation to the state level which by the way i can't figure out how it does so i don't even know why it's in this committee but it's here so what can you tell us about how it affects appropriations my i wrote at the top i did put a joint statement and um for everybody and i wrote at the top this is a revenue neutral bill it really um i don't believe that's wonderful testimony thank you that's actually all we need thank you thank you the only thing i would like to add is that this bill will protect the public safety by ensuring that mothers and babies who need clinical lactation care can receive it from those who have the necessary education qualifications and training lead to improved infant and maternal health in new jersey by helping mothers and infants to obtain the highest quality of lactation care ensure the widest access to lactation care especially to families who cannot afford to pay out of pocket for these services and prevent public confusion over how to obtain skilled lactation services you know you snuck that in but it was very nicely done thank you thank you thank you all right now ladies anything on the appropriations side you're you're very friendly quarters here at the moment so anything on the appropriation side if we are um we were here to answer any questions you might have and by the way that's very helpful by the way thank you thank you are there any questions for the panel there are

your mic on and say hello for the record and uh brief is good then we'll vote hello um corrine orlando from the american heart association um we're in favor of this bill and the one um thing that i just wanted to point out about this bill because i did submit retin testimony i'm trying to keep it short is that um i think that there has been um some misunderstanding about what this bill does um as far as um the difference between rick and snap and the difference between this bill we've heard some concerns that this bill isn't really needed because people who suffer from food insecurity a lot of them qualify for rick and snap programs and while we agree that those programs are very valuable and um definitely needed this the aims of this bill are a little bit different because instead of addressing uh the affordability of food we're actually addressing the accessibility to healthy food a lot of food desert i'm sorry is there something related to the appropriation side of this the bill's already passed the committee on its merit is there something i just wanted to to point out why the appropriation was needed so um but if not then that's fine no i no it speaks the appropriations would be valuable okay the appropriation would be used to um actually bring healthier food into communities whereas the wiccan snap programs address the affordability of food so that was just the difference that i wanted to address and that's an important difference that's very helpful thank you so much any questions seeing none the chair entertain a motion to release motion made second heard roll call please miss munoz while i support the concept of the bill i have to abstain because the appropriation miss phoebus as assemblywoman muno so i am going to abstain in this bill mr

think you could help yourself did you want to come forward thank you thank you okay karen can you speak on the appropriations side absolutely okay since the focus is on fiscal testimony uh i'm karen blumenfeld executive director of global advisors on smoke free policy and i just wanted to note as referenced in ols's fiscal note that raising the age to 21 will reduce the negative health outcomes in our state for those who don't start smoking between the ages of 19 to 21 and that can possibly impact the state budget by saving on state health care costs from young adults that don't start and to help smokers quit and in addition there is no fiscal impact on retailers because they already proof people that want to purchase if they look under the age of 27. and just an fyi nationwide there are 230 uh jurisdictions that now uh raise the age to 21 that cover 66 million people in our nation that's 20 percent of the population and two dozen towns in new jersey have done it thank you so you were drifting away from the appropriations discussion there you did a very nice little thank you thank you so much corinne now there's that was very dynamic testimony is there anything you could possibly

you now the title on a3798 and senate bill 211. assembly bill number 3798 and senate bill number 211 authorizes the use of school bus monitoring system let me sort through some cards here we have a lot of them [Applause] we have a tremendous amount of cards uh submitted with in favor and i need to testify which we're grateful for this bill has been heard the previous committee let me just make sure this will be a long record that's being established that itself is not a bad thing we have a trevor jackson before towns board of education in favor i'm sorry it's chivia trivia how do you pronounce that trevor you were right the first time and now you're just appeared by magic i was looking down the whole thing in there and there you were all right and who else was with you elliot cologne oh we have your card now both of you are in favor and felt you're compelled to speak what can you add to the record about the appropriations side of this um well first of all thank you for hearing us today um as far as appropriations school buses are passed continuously all the time regardless if the red lights are out in denver township we see it all the time on a informal survey one day 22 times the bus was passed our buses were passed another day 34. drivers are not held accountable because and i don't mean to be disrespectful we know all that the previous committee heard that established a very good record he did so today's discussion is limited to the state's investment which i see no appropriation on the state side here there isn't really but without this bill um districts like myself and effort we cannot just put cameras on because it's about a ten thousand dollar cost um to not even equip half of our fleet okay so we need the ability to be able to work with the vendors and negotiate underscore percentage so the bill will allow that the district can use an outside vendor who supplies the equipment and then the equipment interfaces with the police department who decides whether or not to issue a summons correct so the summons is not automatically issued as it was with red light cameras correct the the issue is decided by the police as if they sold in person right whether or not the issue was summoned yes the bus driver would have to inform transportation who would release the tape just for clarification the record how many buses does that for township run which is a sizable community for those who don't know we have about 4 000 students that we transport daily so we have about 60 buses just within district that's not our out of district also very good ellie cared at anything thank you david thank you thank you for being here and uh please understand that this committee functions a little different than others this case has been well made and we appreciate you being here and all those who signed slips thank you any questions seeing them thank you folks chair entertain a motion to release a 3798 and s211 miss munoz i'm going to have seen on the bill i have i mean obviously we don't want our children to be safe but you know we have some compelling testimony from uh someone of scanlan about abuses of the system so at this point i'm gonna have to abstain until we can further assure that you know if you do that we will not be issuing lice uh tickets to people who are x number of feet instead of x minus one so right now at this point because of that i'm going to abstain miss phoebus mr peasy move it out of committee i'll say yes but i want to get some of those answers as well reasonable yeah miss carraday for my

OYhv4v5qz0c,VT,04-01-2016,which was very interesting yeah i missed that good didn't i yeah i know that senator pauline is going to be here in a couple minutes but we'll get started with h112 and um are we going to call up the small sparta this is your client john sure i'm happy to do that um so john holler with uh downtrend martin we represent wells fargo ray glench is uh the internal expert at wells fargo who's been involved in both legislative efforts nationally in drafting legislation dealing with disclosure financial records for vulnerable adult cases and internally within wells fargo of compliance issues so he wanted to offer just a couple of amendments i submitted those to the committee that get fairly straightforward and pretty more narrowly drawn than i think what he had proposed and talked about in the house two pretty specific amendments dealing with adding a definition for broker dealers and and adding a definition for financial records but he can elaborate on those two things can you um tell us what the issues were were those definitions or with your history yeah so um you know i'm honestly not sure why um so as i understand it the two parts you could hear from them the vermont bankers association and the agency uh and the state had had reached an agreement and were and really felt like that agreement encompassed what we needed what needed to be adopted and so it didn't seem like there was a lot of interest in looking at the substance of these our view was that often financial records are held not in banks but also by broker dealers i mean obviously if your retirement account or you may have an investment account that's not in a brain yes exactly yeah and this bill as i read it only a lot it deals with financial institutions which i don't believe encompasses uh broker dealers so we would just simply expand the scope so that it's clear that if a broker dealer gets a request it falls within the scope of this so that's and they want that is it because they want the protection i think yeah exactly they want the certainty of the statute and the protection from any liability if there are questions if there was a know question about whether they're obligated to and you know i think having a clear set of rules as to what who's obligated to respond and what they're obligated to uh provide and the second issue what their obvious provide goes to the definition of financial records that uh did you bring that term is i did and the other parties didn't support that they could tell you why um it wasn't clear to me that it seems to i mean i think the argument was you know we know you know financial record when we when we see it i think our view was we would like some more clarity about what exactly falls within the scope of the definition of a financial record okay so are we good to go on mr 00 am is he did you say he was in california no i think he's in i think he's in boston so i think he's good to go yeah yes do you have a and it's uh i sent it to chrissy and it's on your website just keep going thank you very much hello good morning mr lynch this is a clear air in the vermont senate and in the room are the members of the senate health and welfare committee and staff and people who are interested in this legislation as well as john holler your your uh lobbyist so we're looking we're uh taking a look at the house pass bill on access to financial records for vulnerable adults and i would like to hear your take on why you would like why you'd like to be in this why you'd like broker dealers to be in this and why you like the definitions that you like and any other questions you think we should have asked all right shall i go ahead yes please okay thank you well uh good morning to everyone um my name is raymond lynch i am a senior company council in the wells fargo law department um my area responsibility deals with working on fraud issues and other related problems with respect to consumer deposit accounts unfortunately in this day and age what that means is i get to deal with a lot of financial other abuse matters because it is rather a blanket problem across the country and wells fargo has branches in 39 states in the district of columbia but we do have customers in all 50 states that have bank accounts uh with with us so in working in this area i get to deal with the interplay of the need for reports about financial elder abuse requests for records about customers coming from law enforcement or adult protective services agencies or whatever they may be called to different states across the country and and what it is that can happen or can't happen vary depending on the state and how their walls breathe so i have a perspective perhaps which may be a little bit unique because i can see how things operate in almost all the states across the country and so the perspective i'm giving today is not a vermont perspective but it's kind of a across-the-board perspective because this problem nowadays because of mobility of individuals because of technology is not restricted to any particular state so even though you may have a vulnerable adult in vermont i would respectfully say i don't think people should think of it then we're just going to put vermont lenses on and how will we deal with this just looking at vermont laws because the accounts people may have the records that law enforcement or adult protective services agencies may request that request may be going to a non-vermont entity because people may have bank accounts they opened up in another state and later moved to vermont people may live near the border and perhaps now have their bank accounts in the berkshires area of massachusetts or some place along in vermont for example or they may have products if anybody probably pulls out their wallet i don't want to sound like a capital one commercial here and look at what you have in your wallet you may see credit cards that are american express perhaps it's a wells fargo maybe it's a bank of america maybe it's chase maybe it's capital one but you're going to see that you have something that is not related to what you would consider to be a vermont-based institution and one thing that is clear no matter what state is involved the people who are abusing elders or vulnerable adults they just want to get their money or they want to get access to their credit and they really don't care whether that's with a local institution or national institution they just want to get their hands on the resources that that individual has and it isn't always just a bank account although that's usually the primary uh asset that's involved as i said it could be a credit card because with a swipe of a card you can get yourself a lot of stuff if someone owns their house maybe they have a home equity line and with home equity lines you get checks quite often and you could write a check and it's almost as though you have a checking account and mortgage lenders are not always just going to be from up based markets funders they could be wells fargo is is the largest mortgage lender in the country so the odds are that there could be people in vermont who have a home equity line of credit with check writing check writing capability from from wells fargo and so in that regard you also have to think about in this in this day and age of how people leave live their lives a lot of people no longer have accounts in their name because for state planning purposes a lot of people may decide to get a living trust so they can have their trust hold their assets and then when they die their family can avoid the expenses and the pain of a probate process so quite often a vulnerable adults assets may be held in a in a manner other than in their individual name it could be in a trust name or if they really have certain issues maybe as they are beneficiary of a special needs trust that a family member a parent may have created for them a long time ago so it may be not it's their resources but it's not a trust they created their beneficiary of a trust created by somebody else they could have some assets if it's a federally based asset or resource such as social security or veterans administration they can have a representative payee appointed for them and now there's a third party who's holding funding for them oh okay you convinced us that there might be other states involved in this what would you like to do about that sure so one last point and then i'll get to that is that a lot of people too like to invest their money so they can get a better rate of return and quite often they're dealing with broker dealers so with respect to kind of the the scope of the legislation of looking for records right now the proposal is just to do with the financial institution but a financial institution will not always have everything wells fargo has an affiliate wells fargo advisors bank of america has merrill lynch charles schwab has a small bank but even the small community banks usually have some type of contract that they have with the poker dealer so their customers can have funds sitting with a broker dealer and then those assets get liquidated with the money coming back into their bank account when they need the liquidity to do whatever they they need to have done so quite often for a lot of people their relationship is bank coupled with a broker dealer and if you just have it at a financial institution meaning just a bank you're going to be missing something in my experiences right thank you hey brad i'm going to jump in this is john i think i the committee asked me to briefly describe the amendment so i've done that so i think they get the um the the expansion to include broker dealers so maybe you could just okay so then if we get to the point where if a state agency whether it's law enforcement or local build protective services comes to say a bank a broker dealer and they're going to say we want to get records then the question is going to come about well what do you mean what what are records it might start off with a well shouldn't everybody kind of know what we mean we want their the person's financial records but things are going to come up in a way you don't you don't expect for example in georgia a few months ago we had an adult protective service agency that that came to the bank and what they wanted was they wanted to get pictures out of the branches surveillance videos to see who was at the counter whether the elder was at the counter and who was with that person at the time they were at the counter doing an over-the-counter transaction that was now the part of the other abuse report and we had to have a big debate within the law department as to whether a photo of a customer being in a branch was a quote financial record because i don't think that's the way most people would think about a financial record because it had nothing to do with a specific transaction in the terms of a piece of paper that would show a credit or a debit or a signature or the terms of an agreement it was just a snapshot but yet the issue was whether or not that adult was the one who did the transaction and whether the suspected abuser was with them and what the what it looked like what was their condition um in that particular day we we ultimately decided to adopt a more expansive view of a financial record thinking that would help the investigation but that is just an example of how something can come about with a request that law enforcement or aps may need that you wouldn't have thought about in the first place and then suddenly you have the conflict of privacy laws because the general rule of financial institutions and federal regulators being um quite onerous on financial institutions about protecting customers privacy and information for all good reasons and the general rule is you're not supposed to give anything out a blast you either have the customer's consent a court order or statute permits and here we're dealing with the statute exception which is good but then i don't think what you want is to have a bunch of different institutions apply different interpretations as to what is a financial record because then again when you get to what is happening how do people hold their money again it's not always in their individual name it could be in the trust they could they may have created they could be a beneficiary of a bank account that someone else created for them they may have had a business that they operated that before they may still be operating and for liability purposes maybe they decided to create a suitable member llc or a single shareholder and the records that now someone is seeking is really not in the individual's name but a third party a separate legal person under the law an llc or business entity but yet if that's where a lot of money is for the adult the bad person is going to want to get it so when this came up on the house side and i discussed this there was this this draft that the legislative council did that i think was before you to try to get some meaning at what what a financial record is so that when law enforcement or adult protective services makes a request the financial institution doesn't really have to play judge and say well what do you mean by that and if that happens if you just say financial record without a definition in time what's going to happen is different institutions are going to apply different definitions and it's going to be a lot of frustration and it's going to come across as somehow the financial institutions maybe don't care and that's not the case but they're failing without sufficient definition as to what is meant on a financial record that then they have to say the privacy laws prevent us from giving this information you have to go get a support order and that may just delay things on the investigation so you really have an opportunity now to avoid those types of situations from arising if you adopt the proposed definition of a financial record so that then it's not again it's not always going to be a vermont based company that they're talking to it could be a national company such as wells fargo and that they wouldn't say well you know vermont this is our practice is the way we do things if you get a national company they're probably going to want to apply well we try to have a standard way of looking at things across the board unless something is really clear under a state law and if something is just going to be financial record i i think you're going to get a lot of different interpretations and i think this is an opportunity to avoid that from from from happening so um are you suggesting that vermont should adopt wells fargo standards no no we don't we don't have a standard um we don't we don't have a here's how we would define it in the absence of any depth any definition what we do is we look to what the state has stated and is there a definition when there is no definition then in a sense our we're going to start to think well absent some clear indication of the statute we may have to say no because of privacy laws unless just to figure out a way to get around things and getting back to that georgia example what we decided to do was we'll produce the copy of the photo but we cracked it to eliminate showing anybody else that might have been in in the branch figuring okay we're protecting their their privacy where we try to be helpful but at the same time still have this concern with privacy i'm just pointing out i think in the long run you will find if you would be better off the agencies that are doing the investigations in their mouth would be better off if you apply some type of definition so that the recipients of the request know what you mean okay so you're saying mr lynch that from your perspective from wells fargo's perspective our definitions of financial institutions are incomplete and if they were complete from your point of view it'd be easier for us to get the kinds of records you've been discussing okay senator lyons has a question for you um thank you good morning um are there other states that wells fargo is has customers who have this type of legislation yes i would say um california has a very in their financial code i'm going right off the top of my head right now i think it's around 4056 of the financial code i might be off a section or two they have a section which indicates that financial institutions financial services companies can produce records to adult protective service agencies without the need of a subpoena and then they list very specific examples as to what they need they'll go you know to the extent of like a bank account an application for credit a document signed for by a person so if you wanted to look at a statute um and i had previously forwarded a copy cut and pasted to to john a couple of months back but i could resend it to him but if you wanted to look at a statute where somebody wanted to say and by way of example including but not limited to that type of language california would be the state that you want to deal with okay okay one more question um so obviously there's significant value to uh folks who are concerned about protecting elders and how does this um help your company or other comparable investment organizations if we were to include investment institutions in our legislation sure well at the end of the day i think everybody will be in agreement we don't want to have whether it's an elder or a vulnerable adult to have their money wrongfully taken that their resources should be used to take care of them if their resources are taken the bad people spend the money and usually you cannot get it back again and if this money is gone then unfortunately the people the people may have to look to their state government for some form of public assistance and then it becomes a situation where there's an increased burden on on the taxpayers of a particular state um mr lynch i guess the question is what value is there to your to your company we understand the value to the vulnerable adults so how would this benefit your organization where it helps us is we want to be in the position to help avoid this problem from happening or if it has happened to help minimize it because we want to be in a position where we can help law enforcement we have requirements under a lot of different states and some states were mandated reporters where we have to file this and then when there's the investigation we want to be able to help so having a wall like this will help with the investigation we can produce records sooner than later we have a better idea of what to produce if there's reputational risk for any financial institution financial services company no matter how small no matter how large if it comes across like you're not cooperating with the investigation you're putting roadblocks in in our way that's the practical thing that can be made public and we would feel like well that's really an unfair characterization of what's going on we're kind of bound by these other laws that already in existence that prevent us from giving this information because the statutes that you're relying on are not clear or in a sense trump trump that so i think all institutions would be interested in seeing something like this so there isn't that type of public dispute or stat the sooner that people can investigate and find out where the money has gone um if that money can be obtained sometimes that may prevent litigation that may arise because if the money is gone families may feel like the financial services company should have done something and then you may have litigation that could be avoided completely and that's i think a benefit to everybody if you can avoid unnecessary litigation sometimes the money that people are trying to trace has been moved from one institution to another institution let's say something happens with a bank of community bank in vermont somebody had the power of attorney they'd use it improperly and now they move the money that they have to their bank which let's assume is wells fargo bank if law enforcement aps is able to get the records from the bank where the adult had their records and trace it coming to wells fargo then they can reach out to us a lot sooner and to say we need that account to be frozen they could do something that takes tests and that would also then be helpful to wells fargo or any institution which has now received the money and has had the money put into the bad person's account so it's in a position where they could block that account and not have that money go out and it could be returned right sometimes find itself again subject in the middle of the dispute ray you don't have the benefit of sitting here so i am so i'm just going to jump because i think they are all set with that one all right i i any questions okay thank you very much mr lynch hey i'm sure john will get back to you if uh we have some unanswered details okay thank you very much thank you thank you thank you all right bye do you want to talk to us about what you've heard and the comments that mr lynch made did you hear these before in the house and sure yep thank you and i'm going to be asking jackie and ring jennifer carby legislative council um so yes the house healthcare committee uh house human services committee sorry i did hear um similar testimony from mr lynch and uh i had at one point as you can see in the language that um a handout that was given to you i had drafted at the end of this a definition you keep scrolling um for financial records in case the committee wanted to add that um the committee after hearing testimony from the other parties decided not to put that language in okay um so these um the definitions directed by jen carvey the second one financial records would have satisfied uh so my under issues brought up by mr lynch my understanding is on the other side of the page of the paper handout that what they're asking for is to add a broker-dealer to yes to the definition of a person having custody or control of the financial records and then adding in the definition of financial records similar to what i had drafted for consideration in the human services committee was it is it if if the financial records definition is not in there raymond lynch didn't want to have the broker dealer out of that i'm not sure if it's a package deal or not i mean it sounded like from him he was interested in having both because if he was going to be included he wanted to know what the scope of those financial records would be okay thank you would you be with us for a little bit i will i'm with you all morning okay um jackie chris do you have uh deadlines to be someplace else i'd like to hear from both of you what you have to say okay is there anybody else in the room who's here to address this issue i'm jackie majoris i'm the long-term care ombudsman vermont legal aide did you send us anything for today i did not okay um you know what what we generated with what i said in the houses what we generally see is exploitation that involves banks and our primary concern and i think i actually testified here about it was that a bill passes this session because we think that it's needed for to protect people from that kind of exploitation um in terms of the two proposed amendments i really would defer to the bankers association um and don't really have an opinion about it our main concern was banks and that something past this session do you suppose that's because many of the vulnerable adults you you deal with don't have a lot and we when you have an ira or you know all the things that we've been working on since we're in our 20s a lot of us savings they're usually in a and not in a bank account well it may be that the people that we're dealing with some people do have a fair amount of resources but when something goes wrong they may not come to us they may have other people they can go to for assistance so the people that we're seeing and the cases we're seeing really involve um banks and or leaving people fairly destitute and this um i hate to admit my ignorance but this this law would enable people other than just adult protective services or is it only adult it's only the adult basically what it does it creates an exception in the banking law that would allow the whether it's the financial institution to provide information to an adult protective services investigator if they followed the procedure outlined in the statute so if i were in a place where i couldn't take care of myself and my husband was retired railroad a retired military he's got an account someplace whether we whether we put money in it or not he has a retirement account or some sort of pension deal that won't be at a bank could you can you could you could you help me out given the law as it is right now um i think maybe the banking bankers association representative could answer that more clearly but i mean if there is proper authorization or consent then yes they should be able to get those records i mean this bill talks about people who can't give consent and have no one no legal representative can give consent on their behalf so there are probably are you know if the person can give consent or there may be some other exceptions in the law that i'm not familiar with so i'm insanely wealthy and but but but none but um unable to give consent and my neighbor's kid thinks that my kids are ever paid me off can they go to you yeah no probably they don't have to be poor no you don't have to be poor to come to me you don't have to be poor to go to aps okay and we would only make that referral to aps with that person's consent but you we would explain to people they can go directly to aps and file a complaint you don't have to be poor okay so this this could fit any vulnerable adult you just have to get the complaint somebody has to complain complain to adult protective services for this piece of law for the bill yes if a complaint comes to aps and they feel in order to investigate they need financial records and there's no one available to give consent and the person doesn't have the capacity to give consent then there's a reason to believe this creates an exception if aps has decided they are going to do an investigation open an investigation then this would kick in if they follow the procedure that's outlined in the bill okay maybe you did this before i got here could you just paint a picture of maybe some one of the more common examples of what we're talking about um sure you know we uh might get a call from someone who says that they in fact think it's a name where they think the kids are taking advantage of the vulnerable adult and what the vulnerable adult is doing is they're going um either sort of coercing them into um signing withdrawal slip and going to the bank and getting out money they're taking their atm card they're going to the atm withdrawing money um can you deal with credit card stuff i don't know where my credit card company is but i think i pay the bill in texas or some place you probably need to ask someone other than me well then let's do that thank you for sure i didn't realize that i haven't been paying attention to the schedule but i thought we had an hour any time yes i did so i'll try and be brief and can always come back if you need me to come back so you've heard our questions i've heard your questions so absolutely absolutely for the record christilia president of the bankers association so um this bill is extremely important because under current privacy regulations we are not able to respond to a request from the agency human services and share customers information that's a violation of privacy statutes here in vermont and at the federal level so we've had this frustrating relationship unfortunately when they identify something that's gone wrong and come to us and ask for the information so we've worked on this over the years to try and come up with a bill that would allow for the sharing of information also apply to credit unions yes yes so um very quickly examples we had a situation where we had an elderly individual who was in a nursing home in franklin county come to find out that the daughter was writing checks against the account that she was a co-signer on and come time to pay the bill for the nursing home and there wasn't enough funds in the account aps does an investigation and finds that the money was used by the daughter another situation where an individual's credit card was compromised and uh the the person at this facility took the credit card ran up a bunch of debt and uh ultimately we were able to reconcile that as well so um was this a big credit card yes you can deal with a credit card company as well that you know depending on what the investigation discovers through aps um you read and also you said that under privacy laws you're unable to give this information so instead it would be different because there's a current exception in the privacy statutes for us to work with law enforcement we can also obviously respond to a court request but court requests take considerable time i should also note that there are many occasions when law enforcement's not involved at all because just doesn't rise to a high level for them is the is that exception also uh valid for companies like wells fargo or other investment organizations that so the law enforcement can access correct okay yeah we also if you'll recall my prior testimony we also have exceptions in there for child support investigations we also have an exception in there for medicaid review to see if someone is eligible for medicaid so we're used to working with the agency or divisions within the agency we've done it for many many years so that's why we've taken the position on the definition of a financial record but let me go to the broker dealer first so uh quite a bit of discussion in the house on the broker dealer issue in fact susan dunigan from the department of financial regulation was there and at times what they see on financial abuse is when you have assets that aren't with a financial institution it could be with an insurance company it could be with a broker and that's again at times what the department sees ahs typically sees credit card debit card checking accounts savings account those types of investigations so broker dealer considerable discussion um they made they passed the bill as is but uh we're very clear into the interested parties that when it comes over in the senate that we would at least convey to you their discussion on broker deal and i think i did that in my initial testimony so if you include broker dealer we certainly don't have a problem with that because there are other locations where assets are held the issue of financial records is a different one and and the reason we took the position of not wanting to have a definition on financial records and that may seem counterintuitive because you want clarity there but the reality is we've done this for years with the agency human services and we don't know what their investigation is going to uncover and their investigation could uncover some need for financial records that doesn't fit into the definition that you put in statute now we're back at the situation where we can't respond because it doesn't fit tightly into a definition so would that be like the photograph in fact we've had a conversation about photographs since the time that we testified in the house and i've learned of a couple of situations in the past where they had an individual who showed up at an atm they were able to pinpoint the transaction in time and they were able to take a head shot of the individual who was at the atm my institutions would not have a problem with that as long as it's isolated to that particular individual in other words they're not going to turn over the dvd of everybody who walked into the branch that day because that would violate people's privacy regulations so the reason we argued against a financial financial record definition is one what if you have a request that comes in when it's not contained in the definition i can't give them that information and two we've had experience with the agency and it's been a very good relationship back and forth give and take and ultimately when we see issues that need to be resolved we resolve those issues and we find if there's issues that can't be resolved we're here today with this bill because we couldn't resolve the issue of trying to deal with vulnerable adults and getting them access to financial records and i don't want to speak for the agency please have them back in but i think it would be safe to say that we're going to work closely together to make sure this gets off the ground successfully and if we find that there's a problem along the road both of us will be more than happy to come back in and work with you folks to correct that situation but our concern right now is we get locked too locked into a box and not knowing what comes up in some of their investigations if we can't respond to them or we're back to a situation where we know better off so that's why we wanted the flexibility of not having a financial record definition in the bill so this definition that was proposed or was it proposed in the house journalism ends with or other material material as identifiable as uh identifiable as pertaining to one or more customers at the financial institution that that doesn't give enough latitude what might not fall under that i i mean do i have to turn over all of the emails that we have had correspondence with that customer back and forth other material identifiable as opportunity so i'm guessing the request has to have to be specific it would be very specific to the customer correct so we'd rather not have that definition again we leave it open more open than what this definition allows because of what the agency may or may not come up with for investment so this so your position is the way it's now gives you enough uh room to work work with this group of people who are thinking in credit card issues correct for my institutions here in vermont that's who i've been working with and we've looked at multiple drafts over the couple of years and they've all responded to me that they are satisfied with the draft as it passed the house and have not had none of them have asked for a definition of financial work okay but have any of those objected to this definition uh i'm not questioning your judgment but no i understand i i've had them respond because again that's why i'm representing their position that they don't want to be boxed in with that definition because they're not sure what the agency is going to come up with for requests for information so that's the when i represent that's their position okay so i i don't know that it's probably a gen question but um if we're dealing with um out-of-state organizations that have minimal presence but that's a genuine question i'll ask it well i mean you're talking about in-state no i'm talking about every bank that's doing business vermont so this goes from the td banks who are in multiple states down to the mark young's of the world over in orwell any bank that's doing business here working with the vermonter would have to comply okay senator conway chris how does the vermont landscape match up with other states are we behind the eight ball here are we leading the pack um i don't think we're leading the pack i won't say we're behind the eight ball either we're probably somewhere in the middle in that many many states across the country are seeing an increase in activity related to vulnerable adults being taken advantage of and some are approaching it legislatively others are approaching it from a collaborative point of view where you would take the jackies of the world or other interested parties and they've sat down and they've created protocols for the industry to follow which we've done here in vermont it's not always legislative that's needed but all of them do have privacy regulations that they need to be considered are you aware of any other states that do define records uh only based on the testimony that mr lynch gave and i believe ledge counsel had done some work as well chris thank you very much thank you happy [Music] 559 licensure for visiting team physicians madeline and david do you have time constraints we're gonna move pretty fast on this one this morning okay um it sounds like a good idea i wonder if you would discuss the need for it and if you have issues we were told by house members if we forgot to add nurse practitioners i think it was part of me sure um so this this came up this wasn't something that we originated the discussion started because a physician at uvm who was part of a national association of team physicians was passing it up as a recommendation from that national association the board was asked to look into it and we did last summer and my board uh supported the idea and you know my board is very concerned with protecting the public and part of that is ensuring that we have the ability to address um violations of our code of professional conduct for physicians when they arise and we don't normally support exceptions to that this this exception we thought was okay for a couple of reasons one is that um we know this happens and it's you know this isn't um some kind of uh underhanded or you know bad intended practice it's just it's the reality that that intercollegiate or you know we have a minor league baseball team may have a physician traveling uh with the visiting teams um and this happens and it's not good to have violations occur and not address them um could potentially be an issue when we go after somebody who is engaged in unlicensed practice that we are trying to address so um we aren't opposed to the idea we believe that the relationship between that out-of-state patient who's with the team and the out-of-state physician if something inappropriate happens there's a complaint about the care provided that that other state they came from will be in a position to investigate it um you know when we have teams come from all over i mean if the university of colorado ski team was here um and and a question came up um about something that the team physician did with with one of the athletes um and treating them in vermont it would be somewhat burdensome for us to investigate it with all the witnesses and and if there are any records all that being in colorado would be make more sense for uh colorado who licenses that position and where both parties are uh located on a regular basis would be to suppose somebody on this team breaks his or her leg and it's complicated ends up being admitted in that case the doc doesn't have a knitting privilege right the doctor is not going to be credentialed at the local hospital and they're they're going to be treated this is you know i mean what what they do is provide um you know it's somewhat on a par with what athletic trainers do but they also you know diagnose and give opinions about whether they're prescription for antibiotics or and they they you know they they would i think the most important thing they probably do is make assessments about whether or not somebody should continue to compete and they have an ongoing relationship with that athlete know their um you know the history of any injuries they have so um but they have great prescriptions regardless of this where they're without this law right correct okay you know we i think we can i think if i were a doctor and i went to florida i could write a prescription right we we do but if you're here and you're writing a prescription for somebody in vermont we do um technically you need to be licensed here in reality we're never going to find out about it except if they write a controlled substance prescription and they're not enrolled in bpms that will be reported to us so uh but we were fine and actually we suggested expanding it to pas and podiatrists because it was pointed out that some teams actually use pas and even have team podiatrists because there's so many foot injuries with athletes and and if um if it was a nurse practitioner who could practice independently we wouldn't have a problem with that um what about people who do sports medicine what are we called i mean the trainer the athletic trainers i believe they already have an exception in there okay so anything we didn't ask that we should have asked about uh i don't think so i think everybody's been in agreement on this i don't think there's any hidden issues it was a little spooky when that happens yeah they won't go up beyond canada right oh wait we haven't our nurses mentioned no we didn't mention nurses that's okay i'll speak with lee i thought you said something about nurse practitioners yeah we would that would be a different board though right we didn't bring that up we don't oversee the the uh apr yes do you oversee osteopaths or is that a separate board that's a separate board they are they are included yeah okay and that's my understanding that they're okay with it and and well i guess one other thing i might mention this also is consistent with the recommendation the federation estate medical boards which is our national umbrella organization and their leaders on on policy for a lot of issues and this came out i believe is 2013 or 14 a report came out from them uh looking at various issues in licensure and one of the recommendations was to allow for this kind of exception for traveling sports team physicians the federal elect the federation of state medical boards any other questions was this the bill that we started to talk about that specifically mentions canada but not other countries yeah i can't remember where we landed on that i wasn't i wasn't here when we went yeah and we first time we um we added canada and canada is is really treated quite differently from uh every other country in terms of medical licensure in that um the uh physicians who attend their medical schools are treated as if they went to medical school in the united states and their medical licensing exams are treated essentially the same as the the us emily of the united states medical licensing exam so um they really have different standing with people who are from other parts of the world they can become licensed here but there's more of a process to take a look at what their experience has been and make sure they meet close this bill includes canadian physicians so in other words if we had a team from mcgill down here playing against uvm and they have a team physician they they could come thank you very much good morning good morning madeleine lange from the medical society we support each age it's age 559 we had we were contacted by the uvm medical center physicians in his last summer we reviewed the bill we talked to the board of medical practice we reviewed the recommendations of the federation of state medical boards sent the information out and and were in full support of the bill we have no problem with adding nurse practitioners who are certified to do this sort of thing within their scope of practice no problem we support the addition of the pas also so i'm happy to answer questions but i don't really have much more to say than that thank you for your work on the opioid field though yeah that was good yeah thank you any other any other questions from that one thank you very much oh thank you okay um we've got five do you want to take a measurement break sure yeah so we could add virtues we can always get someone from the board to send us a note or um is not going to be here today let me hear from her later thank you thank you everybody for coming good morning good morning jennifer carvey legislative council um so we did do a walk through of this bill once but just to kind of remind you what's in it [Music] it requires a lot of what it does is codify the existing aca requirements to provide coverage for contraceptive services without cost sharing so since 1999 vermont has had a contraceptive contraceptives coverage mandate so having this language is not a new mandate from aca for aca purposes in terms of requiring the state to pick up the cost of a new mandate but it does implement a no cost sharing provision for contraceptive services and it talks about the 18 different methods of contraception that are approved by the fda and it requires coverage for at least one drug device or product within each of those categories without cost sharing so it's not no cost sharing across the board but at least one in each type of each method there is one piece for vasectomies are not considered under the aca to be a preventive service so while the bill does require them to be covered without cost sharing that doesn't apply to the effect that it would disqualify a high deductible plan from eligibility for a health savings account so someone with a high deductible plan may not be able to get a vasectomy without cost sharing because it would screw up their high deductible plan it also requires health insurance plans and this part includes medicaid to provide coverage for 12 months of prescribed contraceptives which can be dispensed all at once or over the course of the 12 months and it leaves it up to the prescriber to decide whether it would be all at once or over the course of 12 months and then it has provisions requiring diva to come up with a value-based payment system for long-acting reversible contraceptives what people often call larks and so that is to have a a reimbursement rate that reflects the lark's high efficacy rate in reducing unattended pregnancies and the expected decrease then in the state's expenses because there would be fewer pregnancies the bill appropriates um find the actual amount added thank you 34 864 dollars in global commitment funds so that's the gross that's the federal and state funds um to diva in fy 17 for the purpose of increasing reimbursement rates for the larks and that is the bill and as i mentioned to you and i think you're going to hear some today that a lot of what the con what the conversation focused on in the house was whether to create a religious exemption whether there had to be a religious exemption based on federal law and whether that whether that followed through to the states and so i had done a lot of research on that case law the hobby lobby case which actually doesn't apply to the states because it was based on a specific federal law that the states that the supreme court said doesn't apply to the states but also looking at the affordable care act regulations and um and their application to the state law as you may recall the federal regulations the aca do create a religious exemption to the aca's contraceptive mandate but the aca guidance and a lot of the commentary on them suggests that doesn't apply to states with contraceptive mandates so the aca's requirement to have a religious exemption for employ for religious employers and an accommodation for non-profit and closely held for-profit uh religious associations doesn't apply to state contraceptive mandates so vermont's law with the vermont's contraceptive mandate applies across the board because unless vermont creates its own religious exemption so um i'm sure we will want to talk more about that after you've heard some testimony on the topic but just to kind of tee up all the issues okay okay questions for jen thank you that was warp speed yes uh carrie where are you from oh um [Music] oh okay so you probably recall that we record what you say and um so you want to make sure you only say things that you'd want your mother to hear it's a matter of public record okay well that's going to happen why don't we introduce ourselves to ms indian to the rest of the room jenny lyons kitten county anthony polina washington all right and i'm carrie handy should i just proceed yes please introduce yourself and tell us why we should listen to what you have to say uh well i'm carrie handy i'm the respect life coordinator for the roman catholic diocese of burlington and i just want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the diocese on age 620 so i'm i'm here today not to ask you to deny any woman or family their freedom of choice but rather to ask you to honor the religious freedoms outlined in the constitution of the united states and ensure that with age 620 vermont will uphold the commitment to religious freedom upon which our country was founded let me repeat we're not asking for the right to prevent anyone from accessing the services and prescriptions described in age 620 but rather we ask that religious institutions such as ours not be forced to be complicit in items that violate our deeply held religious beliefs this type of exemption is provided at the federal level under the provisions of the affordable care act and in nearly all 49 other states in some form to emit such an exemption from age 620 would run counter to the principles of freedom tolerance and diversity so proudly championed in vermont under other circumstances to be clear you need not agree with the beliefs of a religious entity in order to have an obligation to protect its right to practice according to those beliefs our beliefs about contraception and sterilization go to the very heart of catholic teaching indeed some drugs and devices marketed as contraception including iuds and the emergency contraceptive called ella can cause death of a newly the death of a newly conceived human being which in our moral understanding can act as an abortifacient as i said we're not requesting a right to prohibit our employees from obtaining the items described in age 620 if they choose to do so rather we are asking that we as a religious institution not be forced to provide and pay for and in that way be complicit in actions that contradict our religious values indeed that undermine the very messages we have a right and duty to teach as a religious institution we believe that the first amendment was designed with precisely this kind of a situation in mind to offer the same kind of opt-out that is offered under the aca would put no one at risk nor deny choice to anyone not to offer such an opt-out would however for the roman catholic diocese of burlington impede our right to exercise our religion for which we have a legitimate expectation and right to the government's protection it would also put at similar risk any institution any religious institution in the future whose beliefs are unpopular misunderstood or maligned by those in power we therefore ask you to include in the bill language that would allow a conscience objection including such language would be a step forward in upholding the principle of religious freedom and the ethics of tolerance that the vermont legislature has so eagerly sought to preserve in other circumstances for other diverse groups and individuals so in short this moment provides an opportunity for this body to stand up for religious freedom for all vermonters of all faiths and we respectfully urge you to do so thank you thank you questions so i have a couple of questions so i apologize for standing up i just can't sit my back's been killing me too i've been having to do a lot of standing yeah so um do you does the dentist currently provide insurance right now we um we do with the the options that we have in order to stay to offer our employees a plan and to um comply with state laws yes we do okay and does it cover birth control right now it does and we we've actually made some attempt to rectify that but currently we are in compliance with state law and does it cover vasectomies um my honestly i don't think so because i but i shouldn't say that i don't know i don't know and and actually probably whatever the blue cross offered us it would be covering other questions how many how many people do you ensure there are i didn't bring that piece of paper but there are 87 employees who are eligible for our group health insurance plan and i there's something 60 something who actually use it and i actually have the information broken down by how many are families how many are singles i can't tell you how many are post-menopausal but you may not know okay any um any other questions nope no thank you are you do you plan to be here for a little bit i i'm gonna stay and listen okay thank you thank you thank you erica dr gibson yes welcome i understand you are a former student of one of those is that correct that is correct welcome thank you pleasure to be here we're sharing our glasses all right thank you so much for having me my name is uh dr erica gibson and i am an assistant clinical professor of adolescent medicine at the university of vermont children's hospital i have spent the last decade of my career focusing on adolescent sexual and reproductive health care including prevention of unintended pregnancy i come before you today to describe how the access to birth control bill can help us to fight the close to 50 percent unintended pregnancy rates that we have here in the state of vermont can i ask you a question i mean i know do you ask people when they go on to deliver did you um actually those numbers are from a variety of sources many of which are collected by the vermont department of health variety of questions are there two primary sources sorry my name is kim schwartz and i work in the division of the child child health development department i'm the director of preventative there are two primary sources that are used to calculate the rate of unintended pregnancy one is the pram survey which stands for the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system which is a large survey that is um carried out across the country in vermont that's quite a large sampling of women who are six weeks postpartum a series of questions about um life prior to pregnancy during pregnancy and after one of the questions is about intention um but then that is coupled with vital statistics data that looks at all pregnancies live births as well as abortions so those two are combined to calculate the actual rate of unintendedness so in the pram's data we say see a slightly lower rate of unintendedness because it's women who just given birth were being asked but once once um calculated with vital statistics data it's slightly larger by about 10 or 11 thank you it seems a lot of people talking about these hybrids yeah it's pretty good data so as you may or may not know unintended pregnancy refers to mistimed or unwanted pregnancies and are linked to adverse maternal and child health social and economic outcomes in 2013 the pregnancy rate in vermont was 61.2 pregnancies per 1000 women ages 15 to 44. the teen pregnancy rate was 21.9 pregnancies per 1000 women aged 15 to 19 years old about half of these pregnancies were unintended this intended pregnancy rate while similar to the rate in the united states overall is almost twice that of other developed nations 74 of unplanned births are publicly funded here in vermont and the state spends 30 million dollars per year on unintended pregnancies in terms of teen birth rates in young women aged 15 to 19 years old here in vermont we currently have two to four times the birth rate of other developed nations such as the netherlands japan and italy the reasons for our higher unintended pregnancy rate and teen birth rate are complex and multifactorial but she's not sure at some point you're going to talk to us how you know that data about teen pregnancies they're not all unplanned right no they're not all good and i did provide to the committee a fairly long powerpoint with a lot of data slides which include the resources for all this data so it's a compilation of information from many organizations national and international so you're welcome um so as i said the reasons for our higher unintended pregnancy rate and teen birth rate are complex and multifactorial but chief among them are barriers to accessing highly effective contraceptive methods like larx which stands for long-acting reversible contraception overall we divide contraceptive methods into four different categories highly effective very effective moderately effective and less effective methods previous to the affordable care act highly effective long lasting contraceptive methods such as larc were not routinely covered by insurance companies leaving women to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket if they wanted to use them as a result many women have often had to rely on less effective prescription contraceptive methods like the pill patch ring and shot here in vermont thanks to our biennial youth risk behavior survey we know that only 40 47 of young people ages 15 to 19 years old used a prescription birth control method at last sex and among those we know that only six percent of them actually used a highly effective method such as lark so what are larks exactly they consist of two general types of methods intrauterine devices or iuds and implants which are small hormone-containing rods that are inserted into the upper forearm of a patient these devices are inserted and removed by medical professionals and prevent pregnancy for three to ten years depending on the device their 99 effectiveness at preventing pregnancy is due to these long-term one-time placements that do not depend on daily weekly or monthly use like the other less effective methods one five-year iud can take the place of 1820 birth control pills larks are very safe to use in almost all women of reproductive age and their use is supported by numerous international and national organizations such as the world health organization the centers for disease control the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the aap and acog have actually published specific recommendations that larks should be considered as first-line contraceptive methods for all adolescents so what do we know about larc acceptability and use amongst women who have free access to use them luckily we have a large amount of data and many publications from the contraceptive choice project which was conducted by a team at the university of washington in st louis missouri between 2006 and 2011. the contraceptive choice project offered almost 10 000 women ages 14 to 45 the choice of a full range of free prescription contraceptive methods ranging from larks to less effective methods in this study with the payment barrier removed approximately 75 of all women chose lark methods in addition the women who chose lark methods had much higher continuation rates and satisfaction rates than those who chose less effective and shorter acting methods when the specific teen pregnancy outcomes of the project were closely examined and compared to national data the contraceptive choice project intervention reflected a 64 reduction in teen pregnancy rates a 63 reduction in teen birth rates and a 65 percent reduction in teen abortion rates on a national level the data from the contraceptive choice project predicted that if all women had routine access to lark methods we could potentially prevent one million sixty thousand three hundred and seventy unplanned pregnancies and eight hundred and seventy seventy three thousand two hundred and fifty abortions per year as we in the fields of medicine public health and education continue to work on education and training for patients and providers regarding lark methods we need your assistance via this access to birth control bill to ensure ongoing and increased access and affordability of these methods thank you thank you very much questions i'm looking at your powerpoint which is pretty extensive is there anything in particular that you think would be most valuable for you to look at i think the contraceptive choice data and their links to their website they have information put together in a very readable way charts videos and things that have been published published different journals so because they've actually tried this and have data about how infected i have noticed a bunch of people taking notes and just so you know it's all on our website the testimonies that we ask witnesses to do that thank you very much any questions for dr gibson thank you very much thank you uh kimberly schwartz i don't know you mind but they're about as strong as they make them that's just good good morning everyone thank you for being here i'm really testified here before the state house i have not you have nothing well we probably heard we record everything you have to say so if someone wants to know what you said they can get a cd from us or whatever and they'll uh you'll introduce yourself so we can recognize your voice and whatever you say is in perpetuity so okay so don't swear i promise so good morning everyone once again my name is kim schwartz and i work in the division of maternal and child health at the health department i think i'm going to have to ask you to speak speak sure sure amplify your voice okay okay i'll speak up thank you um once again my name is kim schwartz i'm the director of preventive reproductive health at the health department in the division of maternal and child health and under this sort of broad umbrella that the health department is called preventive reproductive health i oversee programs that support family planning services across the state provide education to adolescents on pregnancy prevention and sexual health through a network of community-based youth serving organization and also support efforts related to domestic and sexual violence prevention and i'm really pleased to be here with you today to speak to the health department's support for h620 according to the u.s department of health and human services healthy people 2020 which provides science-based 10-year national objectives for improving health for all americans family planning is one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century family planning broadly includes access to comprehensive high quality contraceptive and broader reproductive health services including patient education and counseling and helps individuals prevent unplanned pregnancy or achieve intended pregnancy it supports individuals to exercise personal choice in the number and spacing of children they have even if the choice is not to have children and it contributes to improved health outcomes for infants children women and families some of what i outlined in my remarks will reiterate some of what dr gibson just shared so i may abbreviate at times so as we've noted one half of pregnancies in the united states and in vermont are unintended and the unintended pregnancy rate is a key public health indicator unintended pregnancies are associated with a variety of health outcomes including an increased risk for mothers and babies related to poor preconception health delayed access to prenatal care pre-term birth and low birth weight reduced birth spacing and negative physical and mental health effects some other potential outcomes for infants may include increased likelihood of abuse as well as risk for future teen pregnancy for young mothers we know that it can have potential risk for lower educational attainment higher rates of unemployment or underemployment poverty and risk for repeat pregnancies and then more broadly we know that unintended pregnancies redu have lower likelihood of breastfeeding may result in maternal depression there may be an increase for risk of physical violence during pregnancy otherwise known as intimate partner violence and we know that early fatherhood is also associated with lower educational attainment and lower incomes the typical woman in the united states wants about two children this means that women spend three to five years pregnant postpartum or trying to become pregnant and three decades of her reproductive life trying to avoid pregnancy so this is a really important piece to remember when we're talking about pregnancy as mentioned close to 50 of pregnancies in vermont are unplanned this number has remained largely unchanged for about 20 years the current healthy vermonters which is guided by healthy people 2020 gold for pregnancy intention is 65 so we have some some room to grow we believe that supporting and increasing access to highly effective contraception in addition to comprehensive health care provider training in patient education will help us reach the school as dr gibson shared the causes of unintended pregnancy are multi-faceted and complex and the importance of prevention is very clear long-acting reversible contraceptive methods include iuds and implants both methods are highly effective in preventing pregnancy last for several years and are easy to use increasing larc use by removing barriers is an important public health strategy to improve pregnancy planning promoting access to a full range of contraceptive methods by encouraging healthcare providers to offer larks in addition to other contraceptive methods will help achieve healthcare goals and improve overall population health at the health department we're engaged in in several initiatives to support some key strategic objectives that relate to reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy increasing the percent of women who have talked to their health care provider about what it means to have a healthy pregnancy as well as supporting initiatives around adolescent reproductive and sexual health we've had several ongoing efforts at the health department for the past couple of years and we've been engaged in focused efforts to address some of these strategic objectives in partnership through a reproductive health work group that includes representation from the department of vermont health access the university of vermont medical center the vermont children's health improvement project at uvm family medicine practice practices pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists as well as planned parenthood of northern new england and other community partners to identify and address barriers to long-acting reversible contraceptive to assess current health care provider knowledge attitudes and practice related to contraceptive use and to increase health care provider and community provider knowledge on best practice approaches to contraceptive counseling education and contraceptive services including strengthening referral systems examples of the efforts over the past year have included the health department working in conjunction with vgip which is the vermont children's health improvement program at uvm which is known for its quality improvement efforts we conducted a survey of healthcare providers but 140 healthcare providers participated in that survey the survey was specifically focused on looking at current attitudes knowledge and practice related to larc and identifying training priorities as a result of the survey we have put together a training series which is currently underway it's included three webinars and will also include an in-person component so that's been a significant part of our efforts over the past year we've also provided training to community level providers and practitioners such as home visitors members of maternal and health coalitions maternal and child health coalitions and facilitators of teen pregnancy prevention programs across the state to share current research and best practices on contraceptive options and approaches to counseling and to make sure that these community partners are aware of of providers in the community that are offering comprehensive contraceptive services we've also participated in a national quality improvement initiative which is known as a coin which stands for collaborative improvement and innovation network and these have been taken up across the country around several critical areas the one that our work has focused on relates to infant mortality reduction this initiative has helped states including our own focus on several key areas of work that have included improving preconception health increasing access to highly effective contraception improving interconception care and other related issues such as working to reduce smoking during pregnancy can i ask you a question yes please i i missed a very specific link between family planning and healthy babies i did i did and i can reiterate that if you'd like can i get us this in writing i can i can i'm happy to send you a copy it's outlined yes thank you shall i continue yes so our efforts in vermont related to improving access to highly effective contraceptives and best practice approaches have really been in line with and informed by the national focus on and momentum around ensuring that women have access to highly effective contraceptive methods so some things that we know about larks in particular long-acting reversible contraception methods are highly effective in preventing pregnancy we know during the first year of typical use fewer than 1 in 100 women using an iud or an implant will become pregnant comparatively oral contraceptives have a higher failure rate there will be nine pregnancies per 100 women per year over the long term the guttmacher institute which is a national research entity that provides a lot of in-depth data on on family planning they estimate that larc methods are 20 times more effective than other moderately effective methods and that includes the birth control pill the patch or the ring we also know that lark methods are safe and have high acceptability major professional medical societies and prominent health organizations endorse making larcs readily available to both women and teens the centers for medicare and medicaid services the children's health insurance program recognized larx as a critical tool for reducing unintended pregnancies the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists also known as acog recommends that larc methods be available to women without unnecessary burden or delay acog advises healthcare providers to offer same-day larc insertion whenever possible to best meet patients needs and both acog and the american academy of pediatrics endorse larks for teens the centers for disease control and prevention recommends preventing unintended pregnancy by removing barriers to larc use by reimbursing providers for full range of contraceptive services so these would include screening for pregnancy intention using what's called a tiered contraceptive counseling approach which is really the the standard best recommended practice insertion removal replacement or reinsertion of larks or other contraceptive devices and finally as dr gibson shared we know that most women choose a lark when they have affordable access to and sufficient knowledge about all contraceptive methods there's a very succinct evidence summary that has come out of the cdc's initiative called 618 which has identified six key public health priorities to improve health and reduce health care costs five of them are in the realm of chronic disease six relates to unintended pregnancy and the strategies that are identified um really provide very clear guidance for for payers in particular and i'd like to um if you think this would be helpful provide this to the committee as a follow-up um to my testimony today yes i will be sure to like that i'd like to stop there and see if you have any questions for me questions for the community so you give us this data in writing yes are there questions that we should have asked you that we didn't think to ask you one i'm looking for the data on what's our team pregnancy rate right now in in vermont i know we've been one of the lower ones we are one of the lower we're second to new hampshire um i thought it would be second to none i know what's that um do you want to respond to that or should i respond to that you have that data um i was looking for it but again just to reiterate that is you know equivalent to the protein pregnancy rates and many less developed nations in the country that have far less resources than we can do so while we're doing wonderful for our country our country is not in fact we can do better i have the data in my bag actually i can i can also send that to the to the committee um i mean one one thing we know about teen pregnancy as dr gibson has said is that the teen pregnancy rate has been on the decline it's been trending down but it still remains much higher than than many other countries um and we know there are a couple of explanations for this overall teens are less sexually active than they used to be and they are using contraception more frequently we also know that unintended pregnancies are often the result of misuse or failure of contraception and that's another reason why why lark why larks in particular are an important strategy to reduce unintended pregnancy well unfortunately for us this bill was assigned to finance because this specifically is about insurance coverage and what we will do is what we have done in the past is evaluate the public health consequences of the passage of this bill and recommend or not recommend to senate finance and they'll focus more on the fiscal issues i didn't realize we didn't have it curious yes but anyway i'm confident that our assessment of the public health consequences of the bill will be important to their decision and could you remind me again we'll see this but the difference between lark and birth control pills was you had a nine percent failure and oral contraceptives and a one percent failure right so fewer fewer than one in a hundred women using an iud or an implant will become pregnant whereas comparatively to oral contraceptives nine pregnancies per 100 per year and at the moment under the affordable care act did the to the people does everybody have access to birth control without uh co-payments for at least one [Music] right okay thank you very much thank you so susan um is here for an insurance company one of our larger insurance companies in vermont sure so susan grankowski mvp healthcare i'm going to make three points one the purpose of this bill at one filed was basically to codify in vermont law the requirements under the affordable care act and we are satisfied that this draft of the bill the bill that actually passed the house does that with two exceptions the the original bill filed in the house went way beyond uh what was required under the affordable care act and that has since been rectified so we are okay um with the bill again with um yes past the house right which is the one you have in front of you the two exceptions are and i think jen mentioned this that this bill would require us to cover vasectomies at no cost the affordable care act does not require insurers to cover vasectomies we do and we have even before the affordable care act passed but we do cover them with cost sharing so i just wanted to point that out to you that is one difference and susan does the cost sharing just vary with the plan i'm sorry is the question you just vary within the plan so if i have a an expensive health care plan chances are i'll have less copay than if i have a basic high deductible yeah i mean if you look at the plans on the exchange at the different levels the cost sharing at the bronze level is much higher than all the other levels and so yeah so yeah that would be true oh boy no okay that'll be good be good we'll find that out yeah yeah i mean um i mean if you want we can get you the description of all of the plans you know there's 10 we have 10 plans total on the exchange so we could get you that so you can see what the cost sharing is and just for the record we are in compliance right now with the requirements of the affordable care act so for the most part this would not be a change um for us for the mastectomies and and at no cost sharing but the section i really wanted to focus on um was the requirement that or the allowance that a woman could get a 12 month supply of birth control pills at one time yep section f1 on page four did you send us your testimony susan um no i'm just testifying off the top so what this would require is that when a woman gets a prescription say for 12 months of birth control pills right now she can either fill in a month at a time or three months at a time we allow that this would require her to get a full year's worth of pills at one time and we are opposed to this for a number of different reasons one contraceptives can lose potency over a period of time so you know potentially when you're getting to your 11th or 12th month there is at least the potential that it's not as potent maybe because it's been left in the sun or on the porch or something yeah okay um secondly what if you start taking a contraceptive pill and you after several months you find you can't tolerate it you start getting headaches your blood pressure goes up so you would go to your doctor to switch to a different one that means there's the potential for all of that waste you know some number of months of pills that are going to go unused or if you decide you're you want to get pregnant six months in you know again that there's this whole idea of waste and then third is um you know insurance coverage goes on a year's cycle especially now under the affordable care act everybody renews in january so what if a woman gets her script for a year's worth say in november gets a year's worth of contraceptives and then in january changes insurers so we've then paid for you know a full year's worth of contraceptives for basically one or two months worth of premium so what we would like to see is maybe a potential compromise you know maybe six months something like that because again right now you can get up to three months at a time but you know again to try to alleviate some of these you know pretty serious concerns maybe even a compromise it's something like six months so um so that's it questions for susan yes i was going to ask jenna's question at the risk of sounding ignorant um this is the key thing here is to provide these with no co-payment etc right what the affordable care act requires is that well first of all there are 18 different classes of types of contraceptives or contraceptive methods so we have to cover at least one within each one of those 18 methods with no cost sharing so for example for birth control pills i have the federal guidance here which says that insurers could cover generic birth control pills at no cost sharing but impose cost sharing on brand name you know to try to you know control costs but the affordable care act does have an exception that says if there is a reason why you can't tolerate the generic birth control pill then and you have to have a brand then we would have to cover the brand at no cost sharon and we're doing that right now well i guess i'm wondering how often we legislate the idea that somebody should get a drug without any co-payment i don't think you do that type of thing in general but again that's literally that is what is required under the affordable care act i'm not saying we don't i'm just saying i don't know we don't i don't know about the drugs but preventative care and chronic care management yeah i don't actually mean just to say i just didn't know if we did that we have different we have the ladies first children colonoscopies is my personal favorite dimension well thank you for inviting me yes any other questions for susan so if the committee is so inclined to maybe entertain a compromise on the 12 to the six months we would ask that you make that recommendation to finance and we'll certainly you know make that request to finance as well it's a question that i have so what i'd like to do is have jen come back up and open it up to our witnesses as we ask and ask some questions around the room this isn't really an open conversation for everybody else who's here but to donate on some questions one was about the recommendation for 12 months 12 months of birth control and the conditions under which they may be stored in that sort of stuff i wonder from the health care professionals how the validity of that argument so i can just say as a practitioner who prescribes these methods especially for young people who often have disorganized lives that um making them return to get refills of prescriptions is yet another barrier to making sure you use that so if they have the option and it's an option they don't have to get pick up the full year supply at once if they don't want to they can choose to just get a one-month or three-month supply if they prefer it is a great option for those who plan on continuing to use it and some women choose one method and continue it for decades almost if they like it but i will just go back to the larvaes that if we are successful in our efforts to educate people and provide the larks that last for three to ten years this issue of getting a new supply on a monthly basis isn't you know has be an issue all medications have expiration dates and they're listed only very clearly so i've actually worked in clinics in new york city where we had methods on site that we just gave to young people to remove yet another barrier for them and my team was always in charge of inspecting expiration dates on a monthly basis and the expiration dates go out a number of years for most of them so what about being stored in uh in the trunk of a car yeah so the nouveau ring is the one that's most sensitive to heat and light it does need to be in a cool place but the other ones do okay you know i i don't tell anyone to store anything on the dashboard of their car whether it's a medication or not because that wouldn't be a good place well i am i did work in the gyn office for a number of years we had people sometimes who lived in their cars but we also had people who um whose lives were very chaotic and part of that chaos would when i think about it they in fact i can remember in particular one woman had eight addresses in the year that we knew it was because she was couch-surfing and so on so where did she carry this to these 12 little packages yeah so she you know if i you know when i'm taking care of a patient i'm learning about their whole life and so i would in my discussion with them about whether we wanted to take one packet at a time or twelve find out what might work best for her right so i would take that into consideration in my counseling just as i'm very carefully counseling her about all the options that are available and what might work best for her and certainly she was open to a lark in that scenario that would be part of why i would ask her to consider that because i mean even even young people that are in divorce muscles that are going back and forth between their parents have trouble with this issue right so keep it in their purse you know it's challenging and with the marks you said they worked for three to seven years three to ten three to ten years and do you have a choice can i could i go ahead and get the three-year-old for the team okay because they're not very many young people you know for sure they're not going to fall in love or want to have a family for 10 years right so that's right so older people get the 10-year one done no i mean imagine an 18 year old that says i definitely want to go to college in grad school before i decide to have a child and i'm thinking that maybe when i'm about 28 so a 10 year mark would actually be a wonderful choice for her and if she changes her mind at any point she can go in and have it removed well someone who said the same thing and then married at 20. people change their minds how hard how complicated is it to remove that it's quite easy um it is um an office procedure just to be sure it's done safely but you know the iud does require a vaginal exam and just pulling it out and then the implant that's underneath the skin is it's just like a minor medical procedure you do a little nick and pull it out we do those in the office and women do change their minds about birth control methods for a variety of reasons and different times and we and in fact some women are afraid to start any method because they have the idea gonna have this forever and so part of our counseling is always let's pick one you're most comfortable with and that will work best for you and if it's not working then we'll talk about what other options might be and it used to be it's been a few years since i worked in an office that people were very the people responded differently different brands and different combinations for all contraceptives and we often that was where we spent most of our found time yeah we tried for two or three months and then switched to something else right and we recommended they not fill it for a long time so how does how does this well again if there was a concern that they might not like it or might not tolerate it then they could just pick up the one month or three month supply initially and then if they were like i'm good they could go back and get all nine and get on with their lives so going back to the lark is there is there indication of any kind of little immune response or anything to the plastic there's a birth control patch that has the medications in the sticky portion of it and it is documented that sometimes people have a sort of reaction and so that might not work that well for them um and again all the methods have different side effects and we counsel every length on them and we have them back to say how's it going um yeah we're very careful about that we're good and is there a charge for the removal of the there are charges for both insertion and removal so the larks are a little bit different than the other methods you're not just you're obviously paying for your office visit um your insurance and then you're just paying for the method but there is both an insertion and a removal fee in addition so they're traditionally more expensive upfront but more cost effective long term and um check the tongue here can either of you talk about the connection between effective birth control and healthy children i haven't seen the slide deck you've or read the presentations yet put the data you said you had conclusive data did you not did i imagine that well i think you know in my remarks the highlights worth maybe noting um are around the relationship between unintended pregnancy and premature birth low birth weight and then some of the health consequences and longer term social consequences for the infant any of that quantified in terms of dollars i think you know there are you know probably there's probably some national data you can look at i think at this state level um that's not so easily them um the health department produces a determined child health surveillance report where you know the number of you know which are first birth weight babies and so on and so forth are documented i think every other year but it's not necessarily linked to associated costs but there are projections that have certainly been done by national national entities any questions now that i've taken up most of the air time oh air time that would be me sorry um yeah actually i was gonna go with the beneficial effects has there been any linkage with uh between unintended pregnancies and childbirth with aces adverse childhood experiences i know because we're starting to work on that in our little our team approach i'm wondering if this if you have bumped into any research on that at all i don't know if there is anything specific yet certainly logically speaking you know these young children that are born in schools in more high risk situations i mean it's such a vicious circle right somebody who's taking care of these young people who've had traumatic lives and now are highly at risk and woodside are you know heading into an adulthood more trauma and pain and then are going to be a reproductive age and be able to have children it's hard to know where we can jump in to make it stop we'd have to jump in everywhere that makes sense okay i think that's it thank you very much we have a couple of minutes do we need does the team need to break for five minutes okay and then we'll start an e-cigarette and also for those in the room you may notice that i stand up but it's not because i'm tired of you it's because i'm tired of sitting okay sure jennifer carvey legislative council um so we'll just talk a little bit about h171 the the main thing that this bill does is to prohibit using an e-cigarette in the same places where smoking a regular tobacco cigarette is prohibited can you tell us where that is that's your next thing where that is yeah where is smoking my habit you're going to get there we'll go yes we'll go through some of it i just wanted to give you kind of the overview um the other thing that the build does is limit where stores can display and store their cigarettes and electronic cigarettes so under current law they're prohibited from displaying or storing cigarettes and e-cigarettes where there and it says with where they are accessible to consumers without direct assistance by the sales personnel and this would change that uh to say that it they can be displayed or stored only behind a sales counter or in any other area of an establishment inaccessible to the public or in a locked container that is not located on a sales counter so the main well so this is for cigarettes and e-cigarettes both oh this is changing changing that so the main thing that's really different for this is that stores can't have a box on the counter where they have you know clear glass and you can see through to what the products are that would this bill would prohibit that it can't be in a locked container it can't be in a container on the sales counter it has to be in a lock container not on a sales counter or behind the sales counter or somewhere else that's not accessible to the public so they can have extras in the back room that's okay so so it bans using cigarettes anywhere where regular cigarettes are prohibited including in a workplace which under current law smoking a regular cigarette is prohibited in any workplace which is an enclosed structure where employees perform services for an employer including bars restaurants and hotel and motel rooms and you might remember doing some work on this in the past smoking in public places and where that would be what's considered public places the bill does create an exemption in a couple of places for what people often call a vaping lounge which is a business that doesn't sell food or beverage but is established for the sole purpose of providing a place for patrons to buy and use e-cigarettes and related paraphernalia so they might buy their e-cigarettes or supplies and then there might be a room attached where they could go and use their e-cigarettes that would still be allowed under the bill at least under the bill as past the house and it also the bill adds an exist adds to an existing exception for smoking in areas of the veteran's home where smoking is allowed you'd be able to use your e-cigarettes there as well so there's all it also prohibits using electronic cigarettes in places of public and uh public places which are common areas of all enclosed indoor places of public access and publicly owned buildings and offices including restaurants bars museums libraries laundromats malls the common areas of hospitals and nursing homes it's the whole long list we have in statute also in enclosed places of resorts hotels and motels including guest rooms in designated smoke-free areas of property or grounds owned by or released to the state and then there's the um 25-foot buffer zone around state buildings where no smoking is allowed and also like private things like the bfw uh well to the extent that a vfw is uh we don't have any specific exemption to the extent that they are a restaurant bar etc we don't have an exemption for them in existing laws so this is every place where smoking is not allowed the proposal is that using an e-cigarette is not vitamin e it's baby yes i think you can say okay um right and so again there's the exception for vaping lounges and there's the exception for the designated smoking area at the vermont veterans home and and this also includes using an e-cigarette in a motor vehicle where there's a child present who's under the age of eight which is the same thing you have an existing law for smoking do you know if we've ever had anybody picked up for smoking in a car i don't know i've seen some nuts i could rumors say that yeah little talk with our guests yes okay so yeah i'm sure i'm sure we could find out yeah so do you have any questions i mean the main thing here main takeaways from the bill is it adds the ban on smoking e-cigarettes wherever you can't smoke a regular cigarette and also has the prohibitions on where in stores cigarettes and e-cigarettes can be displayed and stored okay i'll be over here thank you jim we haven't had you in this video for quite a while good afternoon or good morning or whatever thank you for watching sorry it's been a long day already you know all of us don't you i do okay for the record my name is jim harrison i represent the vermont retail and grocers association i'm here to comment on h171 as it came over from the house did you send us your remarks no i didn't because they are here which is got a short attention span so i will be very brief but i do have something i will pass out that i will send to chrissy electronically um i hope this one was doing our homework um and it helps me what put other people say um so very quickly uh i am not here to comment on the probably the main part of the bill which is the smoking and public places i'll let that discussion for you folks and for others i am here to comment on the first part of the bill section one which has to do with the display of products and where a store can place e-cigarettes as you know existing law is already pretty stringent for tobacco products in terms of their accessibility in display in stores they cannot be accessible directly by the customer so this bill in e-cigarettes are covered in that currently this bill um gets more prescriptive in that they still can't be accessible by the customer but they can also not be on the counter uh even if they're not accessible today they can behind those glass glass things like that yes in other words you could have a counter today you could have um and i'll show you a picture here's here's a store across the street they do have an e-cigarette display it's on the end of the counter it's not even accessible from the front side because if you look closely there's a refrigerator cooler so you can't even get over there but the customer cannot reach over and get it it's the clerk has to get it from the other side it's a backfill this is the deli across the street next to the hotel and the concern i raise is this is a picture of the same store with the behind the counter so they don't have a lot it's a very small store they don't have a lot of behind the counter opportunity unless they just want to block the rest of the window that they have and my concern is that essentially small stores like that their option may be to just not carry and the advocates of the legislation might say that's a good outcome i would argue that you're taking an opportunity away for that store to sell a legal product and the only ones that can sell it are stores that perhaps are a little bit bigger have more space or more behind the counter i live in a town with a small country store that has a u-shaped counter so they don't have any behind the counter space and i don't know where i mean yeah they could put it on a gondola and lock it and every time someone wanted to you know it's like okay and i'll leave the register and go down to the aisle and unlock it it's not practical what's that yeah i'm sorry groceries you know the shelving yeah yeah yeah yeah what is this this is called a gondola i'm sorry i i yeah i'm sorry no word yeah um i was just thinking of the ski left that's all yeah yeah i'm sorry um my past is catching up with me i used to stock those gondolas um but so so it's allowed but and locked up but not really practical so the practical part is to put it behind the counter or put it you know on the shelf and if you don't have that behind a counter option the only thing you have is a counter so what i would suggest in the spirit of compromise is that you consider amending the house past language slightly and that is and this is what i will send to you electronic whatever i happy to share but essentially it it says not only current law says it just doesn't have to be locked it just has not have to be accessible to the customer i'm saying okay so if there's a concern that somehow someone can reach behind and okay let's let's require them if they're going to be on the counter that they're locked i think that's what new york says new york state does that they're locked don't totally remove that option of being on the counter a lot of small stores have one limited counter space and two more importantly limited behind the counter space additionally as you may know with the refill products there's a variety of nicotine so you can keep weaning yourself down and there's people in this room that know a whole lot more about it and eventually get to zero if you if it's behind the counter sometimes you can't even you can't see it so you're you may be asking for the high nicotine fix when you really wanted a you know a lower number so i i just ask for you to consider that so yes behind a sales counter that's that's sort of consistent with current law but if you're going to put on this sales counter or or if you're going to put it on the gondola locket and and the house bill does allow it for on the gondola if it's locked and all i'm saying is don't take away that option for the sales counter so jim would that resemble in some way the gondolas that uh feed lottery tickets where you could see them but you can't under current law you you can do that today you could put them where the lottery tickets are lottery tickets are typically not accessible by the customer i'm talking the scratch-off points yeah the clerk is the one that's pulling them up that's allowed today or is that because people don't want us to steal them probably the latter and probably because those display come from the lottery and that's the way they're made [Music] that's allowed today and that's that display over there is the same thing it's accessible from the back it's a backfill the house pass build that display has got to disappear it's got to be gone it's it's got to be put yeah you know in front of the window that's behind the counter or not sell it and and i understand there are a lot of folks that for whatever reason don't like e6 i don't like the name e6 because it's really not they're not cigarettes it's a vapor product it's not tobacco now i'm not going to argue that they're healthy for you but they're certainly a lot less harmful than tobacco having said that that's my train of thought it it seems to me you know the fee bill includes a new license to sell e6 50 yesterday the house passed a tax on e6 that's going to double the price so if those two things happen we're going to see very few stores carrying and if that's the intent then you will have succeeded i'm just saying if you're not if that's not the intent then don't handcuff the retailer one more way by saying you know you can't have it on the counter even if it's locked so jim if your fewer stores will carry them is that because they only have customers who can't afford e-cigs the tax part that will be the case because the tax is a pass-through so if you double the price i don't know why anybody would buy them in vermont because new hampshire massachusetts new york none of those states currently tax them we have a six percent sales tax on but we don't have a some type of excise tax so if you double the price of them you know why would you buy them in vermont you can buy them on the internet which is not really age restricted without a tax and you can buy many of the surrounding states without a tax so that's the tax issue the display issue is you will have fewer re retailers selling them because they don't have a viable option they got a little bit of a real estate like you do across the street um so what do i do other than put it on the counter locked up and what do you know just it's a specific one you may not be able to answer in stores that sell only vapor products are they allowed well they are obviously you just said they're allowed to have them on the counter now but and i represent one of the ones that's in castleton and i've been in there a couple times not to purchase necessarily just kind of get a feel so i don't remember how though the store is laid out but do most of them use behind a glass kind of display you know in other words yeah that may impact them differently than a store that sells other stuff that we have still here in stores yes we can find that out okay um but in the existing law there i think there's something in there for an age restricted store that may not be copied over about being able to sell that yeah that does the stores that sell just vapes or e6 you have to be 21 to go in or 18. there was something like that well you can't sell to a person you can't sell e-cigarettes to someone under the age of 18. i don't think there's anything in law that restricts the age of entering the store um but i think some have voluntarily some some stores so we hear from the woman in castleton yes i think she's the one i heard from as well that she had chosen to do so okay i i have a question for you i understand could you make it a little easier than senator coleman i'm sorry zero for one this is about mark okay yeah so um when when items are placed in the store they're they're premium placements where you'll get a lot of visibility and then there are placements where people are going to buy it anyway like milk or something there are end cap things that people pay a lot more for and then there's the stuff that you have to practically stand on your head to reach out to the bottom of the bin right so is that what's behind um moving the e-cigs so it's not i mean they put all the loop they used to have the candy bars and that and the magazines with the frozen bar on the cover right next to the cash register while you wait in line yeah but um i'll i'll give you an hour impulse buys on this issue i do not know the answer to that um it would be interesting to know if that was part of something the appeal of it is affected by that if that's the reason for doing that um it's obviously the answer is going to be different for different types of retailers i had a conversation with a representative of cumberland farms the other day this ban wouldn't apply to them because they have i mean their stories are configured that they can and all i'm trying to say is not all stores are physically treated equal and as they've renovated and remodeled they've been able to adjust to you know changing laws regulations expectations and have these types of products behind the counter so if it were money i would think someone like cumberland farms would be in a position to um would be you know multiplying number of stores it would be very important to them but it wasn't because they physically configured so thank you very much thank you okay thank you for the opportunity yes okay [Music] and she has written testimony in your ipads it's not looking great for you guys but we might end up with five minutes and she sent us we have two things from her on our ipads if you have iphones with you you can hi this is abby roger good morning abby this is claire aaronson health and welfare and around the committee around the room we have other members of the committee and a number of members of the public so um we would like to hear what you have to say and i figure you have about 10 minutes okay great thank you okay thanks go ahead introduce yourself and and tell us why you're an important witness for us yes yes uh first i want to thank the committee um for their time today um to listen uh to what the merchandise position is on e-cigarettes um we're support we're in support of the bill who uh have regulations on e-cigarettes um h-171 um the march of dimes works in um and abby for the record your name uh oh sorry abigail rogers i'm the director of advocacy and government relations for the march of dimes in the new england region okay thank you sure um and for those of you that need a refresher on what we do in the state um we were to improve health of women of child uh bearing age infants uh by preventing birth defects premature birth and infant mortality and uh a lot of our work is to help women ensure ensure women are having healthy pregnancies and many times the way to do that is to help women become healthy before they uh before they become pregnant um we're particularly concerned with e-cigarettes and the increasing use of those um we found in talking with providers that a lot of women who become pregnant who are smokers will then try to transition over to e-cigarettes and there's not just not enough evidence i mean there's a lot of toxins in them as well as nicotine so um the provider community as well as the folks that we work with really look looking for our partners in government to put place some restrictions on these as i said the use is increasing in women of child bearing age and uh as far as the nicotine piece goes no amount of nicotine has proven to be safe during pregnancy um as i said people believe that e-cigarettes may be safer than actual traditional cigarettes but the research is sort of out on that and then it is not a helpful helpful thing for women to be using either tobacco or e-cigarette replacements um during pregnancy and especially there's been a big rise of the use of e-cigarettes in the teenage population which means that future reproductive health and future birth outcomes of these people may be impacted um as you may know there they consist of an e-liquid cartridge they have the vapor has been indicated to have various levels of carcinogenic and toxic compounds also found in traditional cigarettes including tobacco specific nitrosamines and [Music] a glycol substance which is a poisonous solvent the liquids have been shown to contain heavy metals such as lead and chromium and nickel so the consequences of human health from repeated exposure is currently unknown but it doesn't sound very good to us certainly and we would like to place restrictions on these one study that we quote a lot in relation to e-cigarettes is that the liquid flavorings that they use may have a more toxic effect actually on the embryonic stem cells than on adult cells suggesting that a developer can see this may be more susceptible to that toxic plasticity and so we appreciate you looking at placing restrictions on this um the merchandise believes that ether red should be subject to the same laws and regulations of cigarettes and tobacco products um restricting youth access to e-cigarettes is important to protect the future of reproductive health of the youth in vermont and especially women of childbearing age should be educated about the risks to their unburned children and use of e-cigarettes and so we support this legislation to place these restrictions so that's my testimony and if anybody has any questions i'd be happy to answer them thank you questions thank you for sending along the testimony i mean it's great it's great to have it in print great okay well thank you for your time today thank you um community we have three people three and young people who came in just thinking they might be interested in seeing what that we actually have for but three or one group are interested and we're interested in the political process and came to hear what we have you know what we're doing and that sort of thing do you want to take five seconds and say what you think it is you know just introduce yourself and say you're here in support of e-cigarettes is that correct yes yeah and why my name is amy donnell i'm a martial employee at champ um everyone in my household was a smoker my mom and dad were heavy smokers my sister's fiance was my mom actually got diagnosed with cancer and so the doctor actually gave her a choice to either stop smoking or she continued down in that path in general and we introduced her to vaping and the doctor said her lungs have never been healthier since she actually stopped smoking she's cut back a lot there's when people come into our shop our models are we trying to get your stocks we do not sell e-cigarettes as people say we sell mods thank you so much no they're actually um i would say they're actually full-sized vaporizers so not just the little cartridge you get from like a gas station or another store these are actually full-sized vaporizers that has a full-size tank what's your name first ones um also polyester now these are a little different than the cartridges are there no no no it's still still a juice that holds it's nicotine containing that's what kind of goes juice it's a little bit different it gives more flavor worse with the flavor is also helping people kick the tobacco get them off the top and get them onto the flavored juice that has nicotine you start to go to a higher level get you all the way down to like a three milligram gets you down to a zero ground zero room which means you're there for the flavor you have zero milligrams you run that a little bit out and you're working more effectively when the patches work more effectively than you know well thank you very much sorry you got the short script that blinking light means we're due on the senate floor so um thank you for coming up come back anytime and when you go can i get your their names you'll be on record if that's okay yeah thank you thank you very much

punches and i get my team wouldn't show up i mean i really thought my line of question was reasonable it was fine it was your line of questioning although although good job setting bond up to have him throw republicans under the bus and he didn't even know he'd done it i know i told you i told meredith i said i said morris said setting him up for something and then sure enough and i'm like oh i can't believe it i know it was two weeks that's just not fair i know where's time last year we passed by one vote this year it was like 12 to 4. it's the first time i've ended up in a committee i was right after you today remember yes but i don't think i hung around uh remember the rail commission what authority are we going to give the rail commission authority to own the lines or do the line what are we going to do with the rail commission get recommendations what uh i don't think they have i think in the bill they do not have the authority to sell i don't think you've got it it's pretty much joyner's bill from last year right except that we took some stuff from the corporation commission to do with the rail and put it in there as well [Music] you know i might need a charger for my ipad it might go she knows what the committee amendment does all right i will be okay thank you [Music] right here stay for your neighborhood a week or 10 days made sure is so you always get nervous

seats at the table if you're a non-member please allow members to have a seat okay but it sounds like i'm glad i don't yeah williams is okay chair sees a quorum you will be happy to know that we have five or six bills that have been pulled we're down to a tiny number of about 40 45 bills so we're first one we're pulling is 24 20 ritz the next one is 2607 williams the next one is 2663 derby the next one is 33.80 shannon was there anyone else that had asked me to pull a bill that i did not mention okay we're going to do a little bit of skipping around because we have a few members with funerals and some other things so if representative hardin is here we're going to go ahead a carryover bill from last year senate bill 72 i believe we have a committee sub uh without any objections we will take accept that by acclimation so moved representative hardin you are recognized to present your bill one quick thing uh because of having 46 bills we're going to do what we did last time one question one follow-up per member unless there is an extraordinary circumstance something will be considered different so representative hardin presents your bill uh thank you madam chairman members

okay timely filed if without a we have two we're taking second the second committee second filed uh timely filed committee sub borrowing any objections we will accept that as a working draft representative jackson please present your bill thank you madam chairman there is also an amendment to the bill okay line four by striking the words or permitted to sell and page nine section four line five by adding after the comma the words or permitted to sell amendments submitted by representative jackson representative jackson would you like to explain your memory sure basically what this amendment does is this was a drafting error caught on page nine and it just basically moves that right now it reads an owner of a store license to sell or permitted to sell tobacco products and what it should read and what this actually does is it changes it to an owner of a store licensed to sell tobacco products or permitted to sell alternative nicotine products so it was a purely a drafting error do we have any questions on just the amendment scene numb we will accept the amendment by acclimation borrowing any objections so move now back onto the bill for explanation thank you madam chairman um what this bill does is this limits youth access to purchasing of vapor products as well as alternate let's see what the the term is directly alternative nicotine products with that i'll answer any questions do we have any questions for representative jackson see no questioners in the queue do we have a motion do we have a second do we have debate seen them we'll vote preparing to

to consider for parole and i also have department of corrections here with me be happy to answer any questions representative biggs you're welcome you're recognized to ask a question thank you madam chairman representative billy in the current law right now only non-violent felons are eligible for this program the committee sub actually shows that you're allowing and striking that word allowing both violent and non-violent um no it's not but i'm going to defer to the expert on that but it is not and i thank you for that clarification if you would introduce yourself even though most of us know yes neville massey department of corrections uh representative biggs says offenders who are not incarcerated for a crime provided in 13.1 of 21 or section 571 of 57. so it's excluding the 85 percent and the violent people from consideration do we have any further questions for representative billy see none do we have a motion do we have a second uh do we have any debate seen them we'll vote prepare any clothes call the vote representative billy will report house bill 3212 out as a due pass thank you ma'am i believe i saw representative ownby come in okay back to e-cigs you are recognized to present house bill 2904 i believe you have a committee sub that's correct okay borrowing any objections we will accept that as our working draft uh you are recognized to present your bill thank you madam chairman uh house bill 2904 really does three basic things it bans teen access it defines e-cigarettes as a tobacco product and it has no implications on the tax issues we keep the taxes as is for cities for municipalities and counties be glad to answer any questions do we have any questions for representative ownby richard uh far sorry not richard representative morissette you're recognized for a question representative owen b i probably shouldn't do it but i'm gonna do it anyway um we just you weren't here we just passed out representative jackson's bill right we have your bill why don't you enlighten us on the differences and why your bill i presume you presume is a better vehicle than his bill gosh i'm glad you said that representative moore said i appreciate that no i first of all i think it would be great if we had both bills heard on the house floor i appreciate the opportunity from representative osborne to uh to hear this bill my bill basically i think that the key difference in my bill and i haven't read all of his bill is that we define e-cigarettes as a tobacco product and i believe that's very important as does the state health department american cancer society american heart association american lung association um that i'm assured that he has where other differences represent more said i haven't read his bill so i can't tell you but this this basically deals with teen access and the fact that we do label e-cigarettes as a tobacco product i i follow up i'm sure we're going to have a lot of discussion before the floor on e-cigarettes why is it defined as and his dozen i believe his sure why is yours defining a vapor as a tobacco product well the first of all the fda has ruled e-cigarettes already and vapor products will be regulated as a as tobacco products that's that's the first thing tobacco products and federal law defined in part as any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption and this these products are already defined in federal law as tobacco products thank you do we have any further questions for representative ownby the chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have any debate seen them will vote call the vote sorry do not call the vote it doesn't matter either way i guess you can call it it doesn't clean it up will report your bill out as a due pass thank you madam chairman thank you committee members i believe i saw representative treblecock here you are recognized to present house bill 2366 do we have a sub on this bill we do okay borrowing any barring any objections we will accept that as the working draft so moved you are recognized to present your bill thank you madam chairman members house bill 2366 deals with what are called strategic lawsuits against public participation basically it's an effort to protect members of the public speech by allowing expedited process to the judicial system when there is a lawsuit filed due to citizens exercising their free speech and allows a judicial determination that the the lawsuit is not a legitimate one and it stays discovery in order to protect citizens first amendment rights do we have any questions for representative troublecock it's okay representative sheary are recognized for a question thank you thank you chairman representative what is an example of of one of these lawsuits i know you generally described but what types of speech do we see for example some some examples could be if a bank was wanting to move into a neighborhood and a neighborhood association was protesting they might sue um oklahoma does a fairly good job of protecting under defamation but not under other tortious causes of action such as interference of contract and other they're just not listed although the courts sometimes do try to expansively define our case but they don't have the mechanism in place in order to have an expedited process and a stay of discovery so these lawsuits are not intended to win they're intended to intimidate and to keep people from exercising their their speech follow up so would this legislation prevent a lawsuit uh by a citizen or group of citizens against the west borough baptist church for uh picketing and and those types of uh their types of activities at certain funerals no it'd be the opposite i would say it would be no that would not come into play representative williams you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair i read this last week and i guess the main problem i had was what you mentioned earlier the staying of discovery um what utility is there in in staying discovery most of the pleadings are based off discovery it seems like it would be hard to get to the meat and potatoes until discoveries exchange well exactly but the point is these lawsuits are generally not intended to be won they're intended to intimidate members of the public often by big corporations or other entities who don't like citizen groups coming forward and trying to speak their mind and so usually in these cases at the end justice is served but it's not really because the point again isn't to win it's to stop once if you're a small homeowners association for example or small group of citizens you may not have the resources to go through protracted discovery so you may say okay we give up we're not going to exercise our first amendment rights anymore so the point of sustaining discovery that's the costliest part of litigation as we all know although it's still allowed in certain circumstances for a good cause shown in the statute so representative styles you recognize for a question thank you madam chair i'm struggling to make it to the end of the of the bill um couldn't we does your bill allow for would you be willing to allow for attorney's fees to the prevailing party in cases i mean if these are cases like this would be it allows for sanctions if the judge if if the uh if a court decides that this in fact was a slap lawsuits which are called strategic clauses against public participation it allows for them for sanctions or fines in an amount to deter uh entities from filing these lawsuits in the future most states do have a statute similar to this we do not this one is modeled after the one in texas by the way thank you ma'am chair i i think i'm for this i'm pretty sure do you have a particular lawsuit i can look at that you can share with me it doesn't have to be public if you don't want to give that i can look at and say oh yeah you're right this is terrible i don't have a particular lawsuit i have a law review article you can read representative morissette you're recognized for a question uh representative troublecock you know i spoke before the main i appreciate us doing that as you all know you and i being around here a while there's a lot of shells in your bill the court shall do this shall do that for example on page 10 the court shall award attorney's fees to the moving part as you well know attorneys fees are done by application the court weighs and blah blah blah as this bill moves through it i would hope that we would be open to maybe eliminating some of these shows by the court must do certain things would you believe in some circumstances that might be reasonable i mean i'm certainly willing to work with anybody and if you have a specific shell that you'd like to make it may make it me see no further questions we have a due past we have a second do we have any debate seen them we'll vote preparing to close call the vote 14 we will uh report house bill 2366 out as a do pass thank you madam chairman members of the committee okay representative kern i believe i saw in the room has two bills up we will start with house bill 2349 which i believe has a committee sub barring any objections we will accept that as a working draft so moved you are recognized to present house bill 2349 thank you madam chair and members this is what uh uh well this bill has four provisions to it it is increasing the fine on prostitution houses to not less than two thousand dollars it's increasing the fine for conviction of obscenity to not less than two thousand dollars it increases a fine on the first conviction of child pornography to not less than ten thousand dollars and creates a second and subsequent violation for child pornography upon conviction of imprisonment of not less than 10 years i'll be happy to take any questions do we have any questions for representative kern i read it three times to make sure see no questions chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have any debate okay we'll vote preparing to close call the vote representative kerm we will report house bill 2349 out as a due pass and move on for explanation of 23.53 thank you madam chair house bill 2353 is the human trafficking bill and basically all we're doing here is making oklahoma law more consistent to federal law be happy to take any questions do we have any questions for representative kern representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair so this will be the number 22 for 85 crimes but what i was really curious about is the significant increase uh in fines that you have out there okay it's awesome thank you um anyway uh i mean like one of them here you're going from not more than twenty thousand dollars to uh 250 000 dollars yes and as i said we're making these uh consistent more consistent with federal law but also human trafficking brings in more money than all sports any type of a sport at any level so it's they bring in lots of money and so you know if if they are found guilty of this crime and want to pay a fine they will more than likely have the money representative morrissetts you're recognized for a question thank you thank you madam chair uh representative i was wondering if maybe there's someone from the department of corrections here still here i know if miss massey is still here or not wondering about what the percentage of our inmates are and then the percentage and the actual numbers of inmates that are in our penitentiary that that are at the 85 percent cat i don't know if she's still here yes she's right neville she she said she didn't she said she didn't know you didn't know you don't know the numbers of how many there are i do have these numbers that i that i got as far as today's prison population this was uh of december of 2013 that there are only three offenders currently in prison for at least two or more of the following offenses possessing juvenile pornography and juvenile well porn and then uh 185 offenders currently in prison for at least one or two of the following human trafficking and trafficking in children i don't know if that helps you anybody but you have a follow-up go ahead whatever it's real quickly representative biggs can help me on this uh will you use chickasha as an example how many cases you think i'm just wondering that we've been prosecuting human trafficking i know it's been an uptick in it but one do we have any further questions for representative kern seen them we'd entertain a motion do we have any debate seen them will vote the chairs preparing to close call the vote representative kerm will report house bill 2353 out as i do pass representative hoskin thank you you are recognized to present house bill 2576 do we no committee sub okay go right ahead thank you madam chair house bill 2576 is a change to the statute dealing with elections specifically restrictions on the number of ballots a notary can notarize and this is problematic for the tribes because in the small communities we don't have that many notaries and so we're simply asking that we'd be removed from that section or the tribe be removed from that section do we have any questions for representative hoskin see no questions we have a do pass in a second we have any debate seen them we'll vote preparing to close call the vote representative hoskin will report your bill out as a due pass thank you madam chair members representative glenn you are recognized to present house bill 2338 i do believe you have okay we have an amendment uh it is the amendment and is by deleting the word or church amendment by representative does anyone have any questions for representative inman on the amendment no i'm taking it out and the believe we were doing that because it's redundant with a bill that had been passed earlier that only covered churches i believe representative cleveland had a bill that did that and so representative glenn to his credit said he didn't want to step on or step on senate representative cleveland's toes so we're just going to take church out see no questions we'll accept the amendment by acclimation borrowing no objections and now back on the bill representative glenn you are recognized to present the bill as amended thank you madam chairman committee actually all this does it puts individuals businesses and schools under the good samaritan act for offering cover or assistance during a catastrophic event i.e tornadoes floods etc do we have any questions for representative glenn no questions we have a due past do we have a second did we have a second okay do we have any debate we'll vote thank you bobby prepare to close call the vote 14 009 representative glenn we will report house bill 2338 out as a do pass thanks madam chairman members representative holbert you are recognized to present house bill 2410 i believe we have either a committee sub or an amendment nothing actually don't thank you madam chairman fellow members uh house bill 2410 uh basically starting out as a work in progress i like to request to strike the title i work closely with the governor's office on some language and also been trying to work with the d.a basically what it is if you have a non-violent convicted drug offender and they've paid their debt to society served their time and gone five consecutive years since completion of the sentence without a felony or misdemeanor they can petition the same court that convicted them to have the felony dropped to a misdemeanor i'm available for questions thank you representative holbert we are not able to strike title in this committee it will have to go to the rules committee or an a and b committee without a fiscal impact it'd have to be rules prior to the floor so at this point the title will still be on i'd recommend it thanks do we have any questions for representative holbrook representative williams you're recognized representative shear you're recognized thank you chairman again why do you want to strike the title and potentially do something to gut the purpose of your bill the reason i like to strike the title is because the governor's office put in some very good recommendations for other basic section one they also put in their the sentence was not for the following violation of precursor substance act contained in manufacturing or attempt thereof violation of trafficking illegal drugs a violation of drug money wire transfer so they had those recommendations do we have any further questions for representative holbert representative morissette you're recognized would you believe representative by by striking the title and suggesting the language you just suggested there's going to be a lot more suggested language coming down the pipe so get ready for that would you believe okay and sidebar this is not a strike title at this point because we would not know for sure what would happen in rules thank you okay representative jordan you're recognized for a question thank you mr chairman so my understanding is as the bill's written today somebody could be convicted for manufacturing meth and as long as they don't get in trouble for five years they could have that knocked down to a misdemeanor basically we have a committee sub that we had we did not get it filed in time and that was the reason i was wanting to work with all parties involved with that basically if they're non-violent drug offender they've never injured anyone they've completed their time in jail they're paid their debt to restitution they go five years after completion without a felony or misdemeanor then they could petition the court the court could say uh we do not think it's a good idea and therefore their sentence would stay did you have a follow-up so are you so then are you committed to working on this as we go forward i am completely committed i am complete completely committed president jordan do we have any further questions for representative holbert see none chair would entertain a motion we have a due pass in a second do we have debate we'll vote preparing to close call the vote representative holbert we will not be able to report your bill out as a duty thank you very much i appreciate it i did find the other bill that i had i knew i was missing one house bill 2657 wesselhoff will not be heard today and at this time we will move to representative mcneil house bill 2706 and did you have a committee sub or amendment okay explain your bill thank you um members house bill 2706 just puts um canned compressed air uh the same as spray paint you have to be 18 years old to buy it do we have any questions for representative mcneil representative williams you're recognized it's thank you madam chair is there i assume that there's a problem here that i'm just not aware of yet there is um apparently kids are huffing canned air and getting high and we've had two killed in my district because of it okay i couldn't figure it out do we have any further questions for representative mcneill have a do pass do we have a second will we have debate preparing to close call the vote representative mcneil will report house bill 2706 out as the due pass thank you madam chair thank you committee we are going to move to representative blackwell i believe he has two bills is he here do anyone see representative blackwell okay we're going to move to representative mcbride do you just have the one house bill 3184 yes ma'am okay do you have a committee set no you are recognized to present your bill house bill 3184 gives the construction industries board to enforce the current act any questions see no questions we have a do pass in a second do we have any debate we'll vote preparing to close mcbride we will report you out as a due pass thank you madam chairwoman representative sean roberts is he here okay representative bobby cleveland you i believe you have to let us pull them up because i believe one has video enhancement knockout bill the knockout bill so hang on just a moment okay representative cleveland first we will hear represent we will hear house bill 2330. there is a sub i assume you want us to accept that as the working draft representative cleveland borrowing no objections so moved representative cleveland you are recognized to present house bill 2330 230 has to do with the looting changed the law from uh was uh to 500 and it would be from a misdemeanor to a felony uh basically what happened in our tornado situation we had a moore we had in in newcastle and we had in cleveland county looting was a major problem and this is what the bill does i take any questions thank you do we have any questions for representative cleveland representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair why fellaini why not just i mean you've got even with the new fine 500 i mean that's nominal uh why not just ratchet up the fine into into something that that probably means something but leave it as a misdemeanor since this is a non-violent offense well the primary purpose of that is we want people to stop want to make aware that this is a felony not a misdemeanor they're just going to get a slap on the hand uh there's a number of people that had things stolen after the tornado had already hit their house and they damaged their house people were going in and stealing out of their house do we have any further questions for representative cleveland you really think making a felony's going to make them see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have any debate we'll vote representative cleveland will report house bill 2330 out as a due pass your second bill is house bill 3168 no it's not 2731 there is a committee sub i assume you'd like us to accept yes please barring any objections so moved by the committee would you like to explain the bill first or have your video first wait for the video please okay is this your amateur rap video you were talking about is this your amateur rap video you were talking about if everybody would pay attention to the screen for a short video how to bring this story to you because these images are so disturbing but over the weekend there were several new incidents and an arrest today national investigative correspondent jeff rossen is here he's got the latest on jeff good morning hey good morning this is something we wanted to warn you about because clearly this keeps on happening can you imagine just walking down the street minding your own business when someone punches you in the face for no reason at all it's called the knockout game teenagers knocking people out for the fun of it they even target women and children now cases are piling up and police across the country are on high alert this morning you're going to see how vicious it gets watch this woman walking down the street a stranger runs up and clocks her from behind a sucker punch so brutal the victim lays on the sidewalk unable to move in new jersey it appears these guys filmed their own attack the suspects laughing and bragging about it in pennsylvania watch this man on the right side of the screen a group of teenagers knock him out in broad daylight no warning at all he drops face down onto the curb the victim this school teacher who was simply walking home i was hit with one punch that knocked me to the cold concrete my body and face were bruised it's a horrific thing to see and i'm fortunate that i'm alive here to tell you about it police fear the knockout game has been spreading with cases from san diego to saint louis and chicago in syracuse two men were killed in possible knockout cases in new york city police are investigating at least seven attacks and have made one arrest it appears these are just random acts of violence there's no robbery it's just simply youth making the decision they're going to try to punch somebody out sometimes as simple as the five dollar bet between themselves like 17 year old marvel weaver who admits he played a version of knockout using a stun gun he was caught now in jail somebody just goes out there like okay you know what it is downhill for the teens who do it and the victims who continue to suffer these kids are acting maybe not thinking and not knowing the consequence of what could happen here in new york city the man arrested for playing the knockout game has been charged with a hate crime police believe the victim was targeted because he's jewish now as these videos end up on youtube and elsewhere online officials are worried that they're going to be copycat attacks uh elsewhere in the country so that's why we wanted to bring this to you because really they're targeting it seems anybody well maybe a severe penalty will you know put a little sense into some of these guys who are doing this all right representative cleveland you're recognized to present your bill bill makes if you're 15 16 or 17 years old it would be a felony not a misdemeanor i'd be happy to take any questions do we have any questions for representative cleveland on house bill 2731 representative graw you're recognized thank you madam chair thank you representative cleveland i understand what you're trying to do with the knockout game which is troubling but are you aware that as this language is written that if two 15-year-old kids get into a fight with each other that they could both be charged as juvenile offenders and subject to a felony conviction are you aware that that's the impact of the language is written no i'm not follow-up are you also aware that the language is written let's say that you have two 15-year-olds that get into a fight and somebody pulls out their cell phone and starts recording that and then they post that to their facebook page that the person who may be 15 16 17 years old that has done that and put on their facebook page is now subject to a misdemeanor conviction no i don't in fact both of those issues were brought up with the attorney and that was not the intention of the bill and i don't read it that way do we have any further questions for representative cleveland representative styles you're recognized thank you madam chair um i appreciate what you're trying to do i have questions about the broadness of this bill it the way i'm reading the first paragraph a you're pretty much making every assault and battery a felony now the way i'm reading it because it says com every person with intent to do bodily harm with or without justifiable or excusable cause which i can't think of a situation where if it was justifiable and excusable then they wouldn't be charged in the first place says commits any assault and battery upon the person another that causes significant bodily injury there's a broad term there they'll be guilty of a felony and so i wonder if number one if you would think this is too broad and if there's a way we can change this perhaps to restate that so that if somebody without who is defenseless and unaware of a pending attack gets assault and battered such as these situations those might be felonies i understand your question but uh in putting the bill together we have the words justifiable unexcusable so what words would you change follow well and i'd come back with well i think i stated that you know surprise unaware defenseless unaware of the impending attack but you use the word justifiable and excusable can you tell me a situation in which an assault and battery is justifiable and excusable because i think that that's a legal impossibility there's no such thing as an assault and battery which is justifiable and excusable if you have if you're justified that it's no longer an assault and battery to begin with therefore i think you're stating something that's legally non-existent well not being an attorney thank goodness i uh when we i spoke with the attorney about this that was the whole purpose of this language that it was somebody who went up to somebody without knowingly and planning to knock a person out without having any knowledge that's the purpose of the bill you agree amend it madam chair have my esteemed colleagues [Laughter] which one of us but i'm not opposed to amending the bill if there's something that we got better we got to do it now i'm i'm opposed to it i don't have a problem can we lay it over momentarily let's lay the bill over momentarily move to uh floor leader peterson's bills while you work on that is that okay thank you very much with representative stiles representative peterson floor leader peterson we have three bills for you so we are going to skip to house bill 2591. thank you madam chairman and do we have we have an amendment yes clark will reign do you want me to explain the uh bill first first let's just do the amendment okay that was at my request that representative johnson is carrying the amendment okay friendly amendment does anyone have any questions on the amendment on what repeat that i'm sorry you're going too fast okay did you get a microphone can who get a microphone sorry clerk read again i moved to amend house bill 2591 page two section one line three by inserting after the word opportunity and before the word to the following comma if available comma amendment submitted by representative johnson do we have any questions on the amendment it's our language i'd be happy to explain the amendment madam chairman of go right ahead um as i was reviewing the bill uh i realized there might be some counties this this bill deals with um dog therapies in the uh therapeutic dogs in the courtroom excuse my voice and i realized there might be some counties that would not be able to have a therapeutic dog so i added if available do we have any further questions on the amendment see none will accept it by acclamation barring any objections back to the bill if you would explain the bill as amended representative peterson thank you madam chairman house bill 2591 allows a child witness or incapacitated witness to be accompanied by a support person or a certified therapeutic dog in its handler while giving testimony therapeutic dogs assist the child in helping remove the trauma of the courtroom and it empowers the child in a very traumatic setting in talking about abuse and it's been very successful in tulsa county and i would like to make it statewide available do we have any questions for representative peterson representative williams you're recognized thank you thank you madam chair i just when you said the availability it brought up a question i didn't see in here who's paying for the therapeutic dog is that something born by the witness or is this a volunteer it's volunteer um these therapeutic dogs um in tulsa county especially they're all volunteers they're trained in the fact that they're they're they don't do tricks or anything but they they're calm dogs and they have to be certified as good citizens with good manners and they get a badge and they actually are allowed in the courtroom with their little vests and their badge and they're certified do we have any further questions seeing them we have a due pastor we have a second do we have any debate we will vote on the bill for the gentleman working on the amendment do you want a chance to vote representative styles chairs preparing to close call the vote representative peterson we will report 2591 out as a due pass and you are uh recognized to present house bill 2596 did it have a committee sub no none okay thank you very much uh adam chairman and members of the committee for that previous bill uh house bill 2596 adds human trafficking to the list of 85 crimes if it the offense involves trafficking of a minor for commercial sex do we have any questions on house bill 2596 representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair i so this adds to the 85 percent crimes because i thought it well it just adds the red it allows um someone that's been convicted of sex trafficking to be to be registered as a sex offender right so it's yeah it's a registry bill not it's a registry building yeah yeah okay representative morissette you're recognized thank you madam speaker uh representative peterson in the bill and we want to clarify this title 21 you have a number of sections also entitled 10 a number of sections page two you have a whole number of sections 10 21 21 2 all of these so tell me the effect of what we're doing here anything having to do with somebody being involved a crime of exploitation or anything now has to be registered as a sex offender yes i think it was a loophole in the in the law not to include them as sex offenders if they're involved in sex trafficking further madam chair follow-up well maybe staff can help me and follow me with this one section 741 of title 21 is a kidnapping statute is that staff representative moore said our staff is pretty tied up with the representative cleveland bill well my question goes to if someone could find it lickety-split on her computer titles i mean section 741 of title 21 is a general kidnapping statue unless somebody can correct me that it's do you want me to lay it over and get the statutes to clarify i'd be happy to do that i believe i believe that aaron kennedy is looking at that am i right give us just a moment well i just want to make sure that like in the statute it says to cause such person to be sold as a slave or in any way held to service against the will of such person yes so representative moore said did that answer your question do we have any further questions for representative peterson on house bill 2596 see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have any debate seen them will vote to the members working on the amendment we are voting representative peterson you're two for two we'll report house bill 2596 out as a due pass and you are recognized to present house bill 2597 does it have a my goodness no subs today that's nice you are recognized thank you madam chairman house bill 2597 modifies the definition of child prostitution by increasing the age limitation from 16 to 18 years of age and this just closely aligns with the statute and human sex trafficking representative growl you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair thank you representative peterson i understand the purpose and what we're trying to do to crack down on on child prostitution so kind of stick with me here because there's a lot of old language in this bill and definitions and things like that we're saying that under a1 it's unlawful to engage in and let's just go to the second word there lewdness and then if we skip down to part b we're saying that anybody who's under 18 years of age that is involved in lewdness it's now deemed child prostitution if we then skip way down to the definitions of lewdness one of them is a lustful conduct that being said i'm sure this is not the intent but i'll ask is it the intent of your bill if two 17 year olds are caught making out that they be found guilty of child prostitution no it's no it's not it has to do with right now especially in the human sex trafficking girls that are arrested for prostitution at age 16 and in fact they are victims of sex trafficking and this has been a loophole in the law to say that they were not victims but they are charged with prostitution so that's the intent to this bill follow-up you're recognized i believe that that's the intent and i remember last year passing some legislation that put the presumption if the it was a minor that was involved in prostitution that that the presumption was they were part of human trafficking but um i guess my question is would you be open if if and when this passes out of committee to maybe some amendments to clarify so that we're not finding any 16 or 17 year old kids that may be involved in lustful conduct as engaged in child prostitution yes i would and maybe we could do something even today if you look at page three section two if we said child prostitution means prostitution or lewdness as defined in this section would if by removing lewdness would that be sufficient or not no no because that's inconsistent with a i'm sorry with part b starting on line five page two so adam chair yes she asked me questions so anyways i just want to make sure we don't have unintended consequences here and that we fully achieve the purpose of of your legislation i agree and i'll be willing to work with anybody on the committee that has some suggestions to that effect before we hear it on the floor representative jordan you're recognized for a question uh that was going to be my line of questioning representative williams you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair i actually had to look this up but i want to make sure that my understanding of what assignation means and your understanding what assignation means are the same i know it's an old term actually i did i had to google it i'm that guy but it apparently means secret or covert sex and i'm wondering if anybody else has a better definition it used to be a house of assignation was a brothel and i don't think that's how it's used here well i think we i'd be happy to to work on this with representative graw with some of his um changes and to address the concerns of the committee representative johnson you're recognized for a question thank you madam chairman representative peterson just for clarification uh this bill applies to um a youth that is up to the day before their 18th birthday and on their 18th birthday this will not apply that's correct up until 18. it's really defining them as that minor that's it's in the sex trafficking statute as well and this is just to really try to close a loophole in this so it covers from the day before their 18th birthday on back right correct thank you madam chairman see no further questions do we have a motion new pass do we have a second second uh we have a due pass in a second well we have debate scene none will vote chairs preparing to close call to vote three for three representative house bill 2597 will be reported out as a due pass i believe thank you madam chairman members of the committee and thank you for your thoughtful questions okay i believe i saw representative blackwell come back in is he here or is he left again he's here you have two bills and we will start with house bill 3168 does it have a we have a committee sub i assume you would like us to accept that as the working draft barring any objections so moved uh you are recognized to present house bill 3168 3168 allows the sheriff's department to um collect a fee that is already being charged for expungement be glad to answer questions representative williams you're recognized for a question and i'll be back thank you madam chair you said it's a fee that's already being collected yes who is it being collected you know i guess follow who's collecting it now and where is it going because as i read it this is a new fee osbi and da's follow up i don't see any language in this statute that you've written that says it no longer goes to the da's or osbi and in lieu of thereof goes to the sheriffs this looks like an additional fee that would go to the sheriffs is that correct no it depends on which department executes it right now the osbi can do it and get 150 da's can do it get 150 sheriffs can do it get nothing that's not true final follow-up thank you thank you madam chair and i do expungements and you can't just go to a sheriff's office would you believe you can't just go to a sheriff's office you can't pick and choose who you go to everything has to run through osbi and you notify the arresting agency which would be the sheriff you notify the wrestling agency which would be the police and the prosecuting agency which would be the da's but i mean this is an additional fee this isn't an in lieu thereof you still would have to pay osbi you would still have to pay any other fees that are already existing i mean this this is by far a new fee it's not a you don't get to form shop what you believe you have to go through osbi and the other arresting agencies i would be willing to put language in that would put it in lieu of representative morrissette you are recognized for a question well represent black i think represented williams is absolutely correct on that i do him as well and he's right i mean we have to rework this i'm not disputing his expertise wow okay let's work on it yeah i i would definitely agree with that so are we willing to work on a committee sub at this time or an amendment i mean yeah i mean if he's willing to lay it over i'll talk to him for a second representative blackwell what would you like to do i'll lay it over and talk to uh okay we'll just lay it over briefly and move on to another bill if you would visit with these two gentlemen well unless do you want to go ahead and do 3169 to get that done okay 3169 is a bill that was brought to my attention this summer by an interim study that you did madam chair one asked a simple question one of the statutes defined as a someone who is a violent offender there's about five different definitions and so i thought we needed probably to do what some other states have done put a task force together to simplify organize eliminate duplicates and come up with a criminal code that is a little bit more organized at this point put a task force together of those who are responsible and deal with this all the time and come up with a report at that point in a new criminal code could be adopted which would replace the old one my purpose in this is simply to make sure that we don't have conflicts in the uh existing statutes be glad to answer questions representative morissette you're recognized for a question okay i've got one and a follow-up representative i don't have a bone to pick with you but i have a bone to pick with the corner office i was told at the beginning of last session no task force no new government creation no no no it's not going to happen have you been given the green light by the governor's office that she will in fact sign this if passed in the past by both chambers i've asked to speak with her about it i have talked to let me go um a member of her staff that seemed agreeable to this they did oh i follow up recognized well i'm gonna have you come with me the next time but my next question is i should go with you on a lot of things you do representative oh now you got my hinges running son i have been anyway my question is as you know because you've been here leaving longer than i have the the concept would you believe of a new criminal code i think is commendable but we also need to work on uniform sentencing and i know that that has been an issue you worked on in the past do i or this committee have your assurances that if we're going to work on a new criminal code in combination thereof we're going to work on uniform sentencing as well i think we could put uh something in there that would allow them that latitude they so choose thank you representative you're recognized for a question let me go back to your previous comment too uh the governor had sent out some guidelines about task force and what would be considered acceptable and i do think this bill meets those task force it's not adding to government over a long term period it's not costing money and is for a purpose that is deemed to be necessary relevant at this time wow mine was the same thing but okay representative shear you're recognized i think chairman representative unless there's a committee sub or something i don't see any language in this thing that has anything to do with the criminal code whatsoever and a rewrite of the criminal code all the language seems to be devoted toward state court system system operating the system more efficiency more efficiently which would seem to go to some type of a restructuring of the entire court system as opposed to the the criminal code wouldn't you agree you are correct and i would agree uh because i am a uh legal neophyte i will that was uh overlooked in my perusal of this and would be more than glad to put that in there either now or on the floor representative mcgraw you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair thank you representative blackwell following up on representative shearer's question it it actually is very broad and the purpose of the task force as i read the language is to really do an overview and make recommendations about the entire state court system and it includes language about how to make it operate more efficiently identify problems with the current state court system which is probably a good idea considering it has members of the court in the ag's office and the da's and this committee my question is do you believe that perhaps we should assemble this task force have it meet and submit its reports before we address or vote on any significant judicial reforms that have to do with restructuring it's a good question next i'm not sure in a time in a time wise if you think that could be done in timely manner uh yes i would agree to that if you think we could meet during session before the bill uh say an informal meeting i'd be very open to that and uh would i realize that this does open a a door for a lot of different avenues that could be done to help us in different areas and be more than glad to meet with those and get input and that a conference committee report submits something that would address that issue absolutely representative styles you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair representative can you tell me who the chair and vice chair of the house the house conference committee on judiciary is i cannot follow up i'm not one of those two people am i not yet i don't know i think they would be uh yeah this may decide whether or not i vote for your bill representative biggs you're recognized for a question thank you madam chairman i think the word conference may have been inadvertently put in there so if so then you mean the chair and the vice chair of the house judiciary committee would you be open to a amendment to replace vice chair with gus blackwell i would not simply because i will be turned out and but i would be open to an amendment to strike conference on page two line eight because the subsequent section says the chair and vice chair of the senate judiciary committee so obviously this was scrivener's error and should be read the chair and vice chair of the house committee on judiciary so i would be agreeable to that amendment okay so we'll work on that amendment uh representative morissette you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair represent blackwell i'm curious on page two the makeup of the of the task force you have on page 11 three members of the district attorney's council on line 15 you have one member of the bar association but as you well know many members of the bar don't practice in the area of criminal area current law and also there is no designee for the district court judges i think those three areas need to be looked at here would you be agreeable to contemplating changes in the makeup of this task force on those three items absolutely all yes representative johnson you're recognized for a question thank you madam chairman representative blackwell are you aware that at this time the governor is vetoing all task force bills she hasn't seen this one representative biggs did you have a question yes very briefly thank you madam chairman representative blackwell you know in the past year i've been made aware of the i.t fund over supreme court and the supposed computer program that is definitely behind scheduled and become somewhat of a black hole and i feel bad that representative mccall is not here because i know he's been screaming and yelling about this for years do you think this task force is something that could address the supreme court's misuse of that fund or why it's entirely behind schedule or as he called it oklahoma's version of healthcare.gov i'm not sure that's covered in this bill i have been involved with reps of mccullough in in-depth investigation into that fund and how it's spent and should it ever work the way it's supposed to work it will definitely help us and until then we continue to make computer people richer than lawyers which is very difficult to do at times [Music] representative styles you're recognized for a question which means that if someone else has a secondary question we will allow it thank you for your graciousness madam chair representative blackwell is it your intent that this just addressed criminal law because it doesn't say this and we're putting osbi a lot of people that just do criminal law that will have to be reviewing all the civil law as well this is enormous is do you just intend this to review the criminal code at this time that is what i have envisioned yes it says it says shall be to study the state course court system and rewrite the laws it's not narrowly tailored to just criminal laws yeah i think that question was brought up by reps and more set and i agreed to make sure that we put that in there are we working on an amendment for this bill is it ready okay okay representative blackwell we're going to hold this one for a minute to work on that are we ready on representative blackwell's prior bill amendment uh yes uh richard phillips wanted to address the question i think that represented williams had dealing with the fee and might be able to answer it better if we could go back to that bill okay my understanding is when we held over representative blackwell say what representative blackwell my understanding is when we listen to your first bill yes that we were holding over for a moment to work on an amendment and we went on to your second however nobody came up to work on an amendment so who was the person that was offering an amendment and you never came over here to work with staff or did you there's not an agreement on an amendment there has not been an agreement would you like to confer with the author i mean i'm willing to work with him let's take my amendment anyone representative cleveland are you here while we are working on these two representative cleveland i believe we are ready with your amendment on 2731 clerk will read madam chair 2731 page 1 section 1 lines 21 by deleting the word and inserting in the word a page 1 section 1 line 21 by deleting the words of another okay everybody listen would you please start over page 1 section 1 line 21 by deleting the word the and inserting in luther of the word a page 1 section 1 line 21 by deleting the words of another and by inserting in either of the words penny battery page 1 section 1 line 21 by deleting the word significant and inserting in later of the word great page 1 section 1 lines 23 and 24 by deleting the words for a term of not less than amendments submitted by representative styles representative styles do we have any questions for representative styles on the amendment do pass any questions on the amendment see no questions on the amendment i would assume it is the wish of the author to accept this by acclamation to become part of the bill is that correct yes ma'am so moved back on the bill do we have any final questions for representative cleveland we have another amendment clerk 27 31 page 3 section 2 line 8 by deleting the word significant and inserting in luther of the word great amendment submitted by representative styles any questions for representative styles on this amendment see no questions barring no objections we will accept that by acclimation as well do we have another amendment please read madam chair i moved him in house bill 2731 page 2 section 1 line 12 by deleting the entire subsection c from section 1 amendment submitted by representative styles any questions on this amendment seen none we will accept it by acclamation barring any objections we had a question representative inman you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair representative styles i want to make sure i may have a different layout the way this thing printed out so you took out section c which says which defines what significant injury is that right correct because the previous amendment we changed significa significant bodily harm which is already defined any further questions on the amendment seen them we'll accept it by acclimation barring any objections so moved on to the final amendment madam chair i moved him in house bill 2731 page two section one line five by deleting the following language upon another person and an inserting leader of the following pursuant to subsection a of this section and on behalf of the attacker amendment submitted by representative biggs do we have any questions for representative biggs about his amendment see numb will accept it by acclamation barring any objections so moved back on to the bill as amended do we have any final questions for representative cleveland on house bill 2731 on the bill as amended scene none we have a due pass do we have a second do we have any debate debate we have debate against from representative ben shearer can you get in the queue please for the ipad and i assume that representative cleveland will debate in favor yes ma'am two minutes each we will start with representative scheer two minutes against the bill thank you members i'm not sure how we can have a discussion in a committee about putting together a task force about streamlining our entire court system including the criminal code and then immediately consider a bill to address the knockout game and if you'll do some just a little bit of research on that you'll see that it's largely believed that there's a big media hoax over this not to say that these incidents didn't happen but that it was blown up out of proportion and we saw some of that right in here on our in our committee we can't even have a conversation about the knockout game and ask questions about the knockout game without using terms such as assault battery aggravated assault and battery murder felony murder those things all come up in the conversation and guess what those things are all already unlawful in the state of oklahoma so i'm going to ask you to pat the representative on the back for wanting to do something about bad behavior but also vote no on the bill because it's already against the law to do the things that is being complete are being complained of thank you representative cleveland you're recognized to debate your bill thank you madam chairman uh actually it's a it's a misdemeanor this will make it a felony for anyone that's 15 16 or 17 to commit a violent act like this and knock somebody out this is happening throughout the country it's no hoax it's not made up it's it's real and if you recently read the paper in texas i think maybe two months ago it happened in texas so it is a something that's going on and all we're trying to do is deter it and stop it before it gets it to oklahoma thank you we will now commence to vote hmm the chair is preparing to close call the vote we will report this bill out as a due pass thank you madam chairman thank you committee and a special thanks to my good friends the attorneys oh now we're his friends and you voted for his bill we're going to move we're almost ready on one of the blackwell bills but we're going to move to a josh cocroft bill see here yes so we will be moving to house bill 2955. do we have a committee sub on this one no ma'am no you are recognized to present your bill thank you madam chair committee members house bill 2955 is some statute changes that came about from a state task force which included the oklahoma city pd edmond pd norman pd oklahoma county tulsa pd ohp and midwest city pd adds and updates terms and puts clarifying language for penalties for persons who place ignite manufacture cell transport or possess an explosive or incendiary device be happy to answer any questions do we have any questions for representative cockroft see no questions we have a do pass do we have a second second we have a second do we have any debate we'll vote chairs preparing to close call the vote representative callcroft we will report house bill 2955 out as a due pass thank you madam chairman and committee members i believe i just saw representative fisher walk in representative fisher you are recognized to present house bill 2851 is there a committee sub on this bill no no you're recognized thank you madam chair uh chairwoman and all of the committee members um hb 2851 would basically augment the oklahoma and terrorizing anti-terrorism bill of 2002 what this bill would do would be to allow our attorney general and or other law enforcement agencies to seize the property and assets of those who are involved in a terrorist act here in oklahoma be happy to answer questions representative morissette you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair uh representative this this occurrence as fact occurrence of course has not occurred uh in the state of oklahoma yet um so somebody came to you with this bill who requested this bill well actually in visiting uh with the attorney general's office over a period of time they are concerned that there is not a mechanism to act upon these events when they do occur and i would argue that the murrah building certainly would qualify but we're having these events happen more and more as you know this is a relatively new occurrence in our culture but it just happened in texas not long ago at fort hood and we certainly are vulnerable to that kind of thing whether it would be in one of our military installations or or something else and so i would rather not wait until it happens and then say oops we don't have a mechanism i'd rather go ahead and put it in statute and then we have it in the case the the unfortunate case that it might occur brother madam chair yes follow up thank you on page two line six i'll read on subsection c for mature disposition under this section shall not affect the rights of the factually innocent person is the attorney general going then to proceed and determine and go forward with the court to determine the rights he's going to determine or whoever the attorney general is he or her making a determination first that somebody may be factually innocent because that since the forfeiture is being requested by the attorney general clearly that he would be the one determining who's factually innocent that would be the responsibility i would believe so yes representative williams you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair i noticed that in a civil suit for damages in relation to this you're awarding treble damages if a person is injured yes i'm trying to remember where that is trying to find is it page five is that what you're referring to yes i guess it's treble damages or up to ten thousand dollars whichever is greater yes which is greater yeah so so it's a minimum ten thousand dollars and then trouble damages and the two that you had named off the fort hood and and like the murrah building i know that they'd be going against this fund but i mean there would have been zero forfeitures or seizures in those cases right i mean yes we're assuming that the terrorist is rich well no but there are ties in many instances to other groups and this would allow law enforcement to begin to go after those other suppliers those who are aiding and abetting if that indeed is the case we do know that in the holy land foundation case down in texas a number of years ago there was a whole long list of unindicted co-conspirators and the intention was that those people on that list would be prosecuted we changed administrations we changed attorney general at the federal level and there's been no action taken since then so there were a number of groups that were a part of that trial that the court actually said you're unindicted but you're on this list and will probably be indicted they just weren't prosecuted many of them had material involvement in that through supply of assets and money representative moore said i believe you've already asked a question is that correct are you back in the queue are you telling me i can't ask another question i think we had a one question one but i will allow one final question and i'm gonna do you a favor madam chair and i'm gonna withdraw that request i'll save it for another bill you are ever kind thank you see no final uh new no further questions do we have a motion do we have a second do we have any debate see none will vote chairs preparing to close call the vote representative fischer will report house bill 2851 out of zadoo pass thank you madam chair and members of the committee thank you so much representative blackwell is on the phone he is hanging up the phone it's my understanding that we are ready to address the blackwell bills 3169 do we have an amendment ready clerk will read there are two amendments first amendment first amendment represent page two section 1 line 8 by deleting the word conference and inserting in luther of the word judiciary and deleting the words on judiciary on line 9 amendments submitted by representative groth do we have any questions for representative growl on this amendment you have a question thing now see no questions we will accept that amendment by acclamation barring any objections so moved on to the second amendment second amendment madam chair moved to him in house bill 3169 page 1 section 1 line 23 by deleting 13 and inserting in lu there are 14 and on page 2 section 1 line 11 by deleting the word three and inserting in lu thereof the word two and line 15 by inserting after the word association the words and practices primarily criminal defense law and by inserting lines 16 on and a half the words number 10 a district court judge appointed by the chief justice of the supreme court number 11 attorney and attorney employed by the oklahoma indigent defense system appointed by the director of the oklahoma indigent defense system amendment submitted by represent morrison do we have any questions on the morrissette amendment this isn't actually going to pass right representative blackwell do you do you wish to accept this as a friendly amendment barring any objections so moved back on the bill as amended or do you have a question representative um actually as i was if i read or under if i heard representative morissette's amendment correctly i think we need to make another amendment if you get under paragraph eight subsection b when it went from three members to two members currently those three members were supposed to be appointed by the speaker the pro tem and the governor if we're only going to go down to two i'm not sure whether they draw straws among the three of them so what i would do is i would strike the governor from that appointment and just leave it two appointments one from the speaker on line 14 and leave the speaker in the pro tem selecting those two members representative blackwell would you accept that as a friendly amendment okay we're working on the drafting you have any other task force bills you'd like to run i today ideas for several if you'd like not really i had one that i had one that wasn't heard last year on common core we could revive that one if you would like are you ready clerk will read item chair move to amend house bill 3169 page 2 section 1 lines 13-14 by deleting the words and the governor amendment submitted by representative inman any questions for representative inman on the third amendment barring none then we will accept this uh by acclimation so moved back on the bill as amended do we have any final questions before motions for representative blackwell on house bill 3169 see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have debate we'll vote chairs preparing to close call to vote representative blackwell we will report house bill 3169 out as a do pass we are back on house bill 3168. we have a committee sub which we adopted no amendments were offered back on the bill for final questions before a motion do we have any questions for representative backwell on 3168. chair would entertain a motion do we have a second any debate representative williams was that a yes yes okay anyone else we will have two minutes against from representative williams and then two minutes four from representative blackwell representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair and members i won't take the full time i usually don't rise to debate in these and um if this weren't the last week of committee i wouldn't be doing it on this one but members this is a new fee this is another 150 dollars and and the argument has been made that it's a fee for service anytime you file an expungement you pay the court clerk to file a new civil action you have to serve the the prosecuting agency you have to serve the the arresting agencies and you have to serve osbi there are costs incurred in all of those steps and so doing it and there might be a little bit of work typically it's keystrokes that's involved in doing something a few years ago osbi got 150 fee put on every expungement in reality it should have probably been 50 because that's more indicative of the work involved in it but nobody spoke up then but i'm speaking up now i love the sheriffs and i know that they need money but there's no reason that we should be front loading another fee onto our criminal justice system it is abysmal what we do to the administration of justice in this state and is one of the primary reasons we're at 99.5 occupancy and if you want to see another way to keep people from getting to work this is it you're going to make expungements for rich people only people like me can get anything they want taken off the record but socioeconomically speaking most criminals aren't of my socioeconomic statute so what we're end up doing is the group that needs it the most is going to be the ones that are least able to get it now if we want to go back in and tell osbi we're going to give you a fee for your service it's going to be indicative of what you actually get and what you actually do then let's do that i'm all for reallocation of funds let's take the 150 split in half give 75 to the sheriffs i think that makes them fair and let's give 75 to osbi because that's the work they have involved it's keystrokes but putting another hundred and fifty dollar fee is just going to make it another tool for rich people to get their records clean and the people that need it the most the people that can't get to work won't be able to do it representative blackwell you are recognized to debate for your bill thank you i rise to address the equality uh the sheriff's also do work and they should get paid i do agree with representing williams that the fee that is charged is probably too high and would be glad to work with him to set a more equitable fee for everyone involved i just want to make sure that it's equitable for both osbi the sheriffs all those involved would be glad to look at that to make sure that that fee is not as onerous as it uh is presented to keep people from getting an expungement that would need or deserve that expungement and with that i ask you for your yes vote on this to allow those that have done the work with the sheriff's department to also do the same thing as we have already done with osbi and others thank you i appreciate your yes vote on this okay we'll open the queue for voting chairs preparing to close the queue call the vote representative blackwell 3168.18 will remain property of the committee thank you madam chair members appreciate it at this time i believe we have four members left to present that are not on the committee which we will hear quickly and efficiently and then we will have a five minute break and come back for all the members bills so we will now recognize representative o'donnell for house bill 2541 do we have a committee sub on this bill uh no madam chair okay you're recognized to present the bill 2541 uh actually allows district attorneys to prosecute sexting between teenagers as a misdemeanor what's going on right now in the state of oklahoma as our da's are reluctant to prosecute that crime between individuals under the age of 18 because it will label them a sex offender this will allow it to be prosecuted as a misdemeanor and they can have that expunged this will allow for more robust enforcement of the law and for that after that i stand for questions do we have any questions for representative o'donnell representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair my only question is you had some educational programming that was in here do the attendance the successful completion of an educational program are those in existence now or is that something that needs to be created or the the bill actually directs the department of education working in conjunction with the attorney general to establish that educational program that has been done in other states such as texas new jersey and other states it i don't anticipate that's going to take a great deal of effort to create that wheel representative morissette you're recognized uh representative i assume this was a request bill from the da's council the da's council is supportive of this measure but your that assumption is incorrect i came up with this myself follow up okay what kind of prevalent problem is this we're dealing with minors um is this something that is is over prevalent in the tulsa area or something that that that the da's there have found that they have to they've run into a wall where there's something they have to address we are talking about miners here aren't we we're talking about this statute covers individuals that are under the age of 18. minors um i will tell you uh representative morrissette that i have daughters that are 13 and 15 that attend to christian school in tulsa and this uh the solicitation of sexting and the the distribution of that material is uh i'm not going to say it's widespread but it is it's out there it's going on so i can only imagine what's going on in in public schools and i and i'm visiting with the district attorneys about this issue uh it's a challenge because first of all you know sometimes uh kids make mistakes this allows a kid to make a mistake and not be labeled as a sex offender that's what i thought representative moore said do you have a follow-up i wouldn't want to deny you your ability well i understand that i understand that you were offended at church one day and i i just wonder uh of course kids didn't have the phones they wouldn't have to worry about it i guess what are you talking about i guess i don't understand your question well again it's been a long day for richard oh christian school all right what i'm saying is are we over are we trying to kill a mosquito with a shotgun here well i think that's what the law does presently by putting the putting the our law enforcement agencies in the position of prosecuting this crime as a mis as a felony what they're doing is they're not prosecuting it because they don't want to tag juveniles with a felony conviction and label them as sex offenders this allows a knuckleheaded kid a mistake well we'll will the recognize for your third follow-up thank you i had one we'll remember this later yes thank you for i had one in the marker barrel um will all of this then be automatically expunged at the end of the treatment at the end of the uh completion of the educational program would that be fair it is you're asking me what the bill says versus what i think is fair which which which answer do you want okay i can answer that question if we're going to do this and have them successfully complete the educational program then i i submit that there should be language in here that will automatically automatically by law expunge not only the arrest or anything to do with this particular offense representative i'd be happy to work with you when that language however you realize you would be depriving representative williams of that fee i object when it's my fee [Laughter] representative eckles you are recognized for a question see no further questions do we have a motion do we have a second do we have debate seeing them will vote chairs preparing to close you're sexting and driving bills yeah representative morris said i hate to ask why yours is blue i'll ask later okay just thinking about the content of the bill [Laughter] call the vote eleven representative o'donnell we will report this bill out as a due pass and it is my understanding that you're presenting an eccles bill as well that's been transferred to your name which is house bill 3375 correct thank you madam chair yes i am presenting a and do we have a committee sub on 3375 i believe that we do yes okay would you i would assume you would like us to accept by acclamation that is a working draft barring any uh objections so moved you are recognized to present house bill 3375 as amended 3375 members uh modifies the discovery code section 3226 it basically recognizes the use of releases as a form of discovery to provide efficient and relevant records up front in exchange between the parties with that i will stand for questions do we have any questions for representative o'donnell see no questions we have a do pass in a second do we have debate seen them we'll vote preparing to close call the vote representative o'donnell you are two for two this bill will be reported out as a due pass thank you madam chair on to representative turner he is on his way on to representative walker uh representative walker you are recognized to present house bill 2324 which i believe has a committee sub yes ma'am and you would like to use that as the working draft yes ma'am barring any objections so moved please uh explain your bill is amended thank you madam chair members when somebody comes from another state who is lawfully able to possess and carry a firearm when they come to oklahoma we consider them authorized to carry what this bill does is consider them licensed as it relates to the gun-free school zone act i'll be happy to take any questions do we have any questions for representative walker on house bill 23-24 see no questions we have a do pass and a second do we have any debate seen them we'll vote preparing to close call the vote representative walker will report house bill 2324 out as a due pass thank you madam chair representative sean roberts has two bills to be heard we will start with house bill 3013 i believe you have a committee sub is that correct on this bill no we do not go ahead and present your bill please members it's a simple change from a projectile to projectiles the reason behind this is adding the s will also include a rat shot in a 22 shell or self-defense ammo and a taurus judge or sm or what run again sorry changing from from a single word to the s it includes more projectiles it includes like rat shot and a 22 examples so there's more examples if you have any take questions do we have any questions for representative roberts representative williams you're recognized sorry i just have to ask the obvious i mean i assume that this came from somewhere i mean is somebody was somebody able to get out of criminal prosecution because it didn't have the answer i mean it's a preventative measure do we have any further questions for representative roberts seen them we'll entertain a motion do we have a second do we have any debate seen them we'll vote chairs preparing to close call the vote representative sean roberts house bill 3013 reported out as a due pass you are recognized for house bill 3016. i believe this one does have a yes i assume you would like us to adopt that as the working draft yes barring any objections so moved you're recognized to present house bill 3016. thank you chairman members this is trying to close a loophole what we had in our part of the state someone was moving from one location to another to another never technically intending to stay seven days so they were following falling outside of the law i do believe i've asked a member of the committee to offer an amendment to the bill to the committee sub clerk will read madam chair i moved him in house bill 3016 page two section one line eight by replacing the word 30 day with the word 60 day amendment submitted by representative styles do we have any questions for representative styles or roberts on the amendment representative morris said i do not see you in the queue was that a question [Music] you're recognized representative i can take the question i'll defer aren't you the one the author of the amendment i ask them to i am i'm deferring if you want me to i'll answer tell me what it means sean can you come here please i'm just okay all we're doing is changing the word from 30 days to 60 days it makes a little tougher because it 30 days was such a short period of time it covers people who go to grandma's house for christmas both weekends and the week but that's about it we didn't want to expand it much longer so a 60-day period if they're going to be more than 14 days we want them to register okay do we have any further questions on the amendment in a 60-day period seeing none we will accept the amendment by acclimation barring any objections so moved back on the bill as amended do we have any final questions for representative roberts on house bill 3016. see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have debate see none will vote preparing to close call the vote representative roberts 3016 will be reported out as a due pass thank you chairman thank you committee members okay if i am not wrong we only have one person left that is a non-committee member with the bill representative turner are you back yes sorry you had to miss any of the fun and leave for a little bit i think everybody else can benefit from that you are recognized to present house bill 24-59 is there a committee sub on this bill uh there's no shenanigans on this bill okay please present your bill all right this is something where this was actually a request by me has to deal with motorcycle safety i saw a toddler on the back of a motorcycle and i was pretty disturbed by that and then did some research and found that in other states um there's been deaths recently by having um you know two-year-olds three-year-olds on motorcycles and unfortunately the kids fall off or they get in accidents and i find that rather disturbing and then i sat there and realized that in our statutes we don't have a minimum age so i just feel that it's one of those things where yes we're having to legislate common sense but for me it's rather common sense there does need to be a minimum age to be on a motorcycle and i've looked at texas statute and texas has put that at five years of age and so that's what i am modeling after do we have any questions for representative turner representative morrissette you're recognized is it a requirement in texas because i don't see any language here about making sure that anyone over the age a child over the age of five i guess you could have a helmet a motorcycle helmet that i don't think they have the mandate there well what do you think of that man me personally i strongly feel that if you're on that you need to have a helmet if you're a kid you should probably be on that helmet however if you're a parent that's stupid is not giving your kid a helmet i think the parents should be punished on that representative morris said staff is telling me that in oklahoma we're already required under 18 to wear a helmet okay let me answer that for clarification [Music] representative jordan you're recognized for a question thank you madam chairman uh representative turner i'm trying to read through here but um would this prohibit any kind of like a four-wheel gator type uh four-wheeler or you know one of those little gators you can drive around the farm or something oh something like that uh as far as i can tell that this only applies to two wheeled vehicles was there a follow-up representative jordan no i'm just trying to verify that in the bill okay there's nothing about wheels i don't think a quad qualifies as a motorcycle i think it does i mean yeah there's some yamaha raptors you know with you know leaders in them that'll jordan did you wish to offer an amendment or have a follow-up okay do we have any further questions for representative turner see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second and do we have any debate seen them we'll vote down i will not call the vote representative turner you squeaked that one by and we will report that out as a due pass at this time we are two-thirds through every bill left is a member of the committee we're taking a 10-minute break for the restroom or whatever you'd like and we will meet right back here [Music] [Music] [Music] what are we doing here talk to corey is [Music] right now it's two years that's what i said is questions are about to become outlawed we gotta move interpretation of the constitutional interpretation of constitutional things that are not otherwise interpreted i think the legislature probably can set the standards this is nothing more than a standard of reviews so if the legislature could set standards okay is i'll ask him what the purpose is oh we're two thirds done now wait a second if but i don't know is i can't wait for that committee why is there no resistance well in that case maybe i'm for it uh i was paying attention to something else did you call that lady i texted beverage yes i did adrian let me uh let me call you right back with it call her back beverage all right let me call you right back [Music] well let's see our oh absolutely that's absolutely correct i tell him that i have a dinner i know [Laughter] [Laughter] it's blood money style [Laughter] i know about eight minutes ago i don't have a forum here that's pretty good he already wants the gavel okay let's try to get back in here do we have anybody out in the hall in the foyer we need a i think we quorum it okay now sometimes i think we don't appreciate our staff enough who does an exponential amount of work just think of everybody that has done uh amendments late file bills committee subs and in particular today is brad woggamot's birthday [Applause] and since everybody knows that i'm the touchy feely meat and mild type i went out and bought some cupcakes in honor of this and uh we're we're going to sing happy birthday to brad not on your microphones please who wants to start it so is the church of christ guy here the acapella guy where's gra [Music] stardust [Applause] [Music] [Applause] pass one down and that also means we need to remember aaron and grace and quinn and marilyn because we have a fantastic staff in this committee okay and we can eat and work at the same time so no worries thank you so much stick some forks in here brett we didn't ask how old he was we were very nice really what i thought you were a lot younger than that it's good that's a good thing i could have said i thought you were a senior okay i believe that we are ready for representative williams house bill 2608 as we're going to go through an order now well actually okay i'm going to hold that defer i have made a promise to mr collison in the oklahoma farm bureau that i would hear steve martin's two bills which means that eccles no bigs but cory's to the end so i know he votes on mine oh representative biggs is recognized to to present the two martin bills we'll start with house bill 26 just one 26-13 is 26-16 not going to be heard yeah ready on that one oh okay so 2613 steve martin's bill by representative biggs do we have a committee sub we have two subs we want the second sub is the working draft yes barring any objections we'll accept that by acclimation so moved you are recognized to present the bill thank you madam chairman and members i'd also filed an amendment um at this time i'd like to withdraw that amendment okay as members knows representative martin was taking the hospital so i'd been visiting with him quite a bit on this bill because i was offering an amendment to remove part of that that he was unwilling to accept so i know about this bill and be happy to answer any questions do we have any questions for representative biggs we have a question from representative stiles thank you madam chair i'm not quite understanding what the amendment does because in paragraph a it says any person who shall willfully maliciously torture destroy kill and then as a result causes the death severe physical pain it seems like we've just stated the exact same thing twice why are we doing that i mean obviously any person who shall willfully kill something and cause the death of it has if you've killed something you've caused the death of it why is that necessary as you know i am presenting this bill for representative martin because he's in the hospital that's why he wanted that language i do not know i believe the the real motivation of this bill is in paragraph for him is b is a paragraph i'd like to remove but i'll file that on the floor but paragraph c is the real meaning of this bill do we have any further questions for representative biggs representative jordan representative biggs i'm i'm maybe getting confused between the two drafts here so that the issue that we talked about last week is that the same paragraph b that's still in the bill yes however he's in this uh committee sub number two he's definitely he's removed the part about air shelter space okay um this is now just four lines and that part that we talked about and he laid the bill over for has been removed but he still did create a misdemeanor do we have any further questions we have a due pass do we have a second do we have any debate seen them we'll vote yes it's not fair to do that right now that's a big word for you styles norman guy preparing to close get back in the mood call the vote whoop call the vote representative biggs this bill will remain property of the committee 2616 is that representative echols presenting that for martin is that correct yes ma'am do we have a sub on this bill okay you're recognized to explain the bill uh this is a cleanup last year those of us that remember we passed a bill making it a felony to if you uh caused arson while you were manufacturing meth there was a cleanup language we added the word maliciousness malicious to the fire itself um if you're manufacturing meth in your home you're not intending to cause a fire so we have to clean that section up and what we've done is subsection a you see where we struck the language we reinserted it in subsection b um so now it's a felony to cause a house fire while you're manufacturing meth but you don't have to intend to have caused a fire you have to intend to have manufactured meth well you'll yield questions we have any questions on this bill see no questions we have a due pass do we have a second will we have debate seen them we'll vote chairs preparing to close call to vote representative echols if you will tell representative martin we will pass his bill out as a due pass on back to representative williams house bill 2608 do we have a committee sub on this bill i assume you'd like to use that as the working draft barring any objections yes madam chair so moved please present house bill 2608 is amended thank you madam chair members this allows on trafficking current law says that if you've done it twice or more then you are going to serve life without parole which is just a living death sentence what that leads to sometimes is jury nullification because the jury's not willing to hand out that kind of a punishment for this type of a crime uh and so what we're allowing is not less than 20 years up to life in prison or life without parole so we have not stricken life without parole but we've added a couple of options in there for a jury that may be more willing to convict on a trafficking count because op or something else is available be glad to take questions do we have any questions for representative williams representative biggs you're recognized thank you madam chairman represent williams current law is if you've had any prior cds charges um then your third and subsequent could be life without parole yes are you changing that to now you have to have three trafficking convictions no it didn't qualify it'll still be the cds we didn't change anything other than adding in uh the not less than 20 years to life in prison we had previously in previous versions you're right representative we had that in there um we came to a compromise with the district attorney's council and this language is a result of that compromise do we have any further questions for representative williams seen none we have a due past do we have a second okay do we have any debate we'll vote representative williams will report 2608 out as a due pass and you are recognized to present house bill 2609 do you have a committee sub on this bill i do madam chair we will accept that as the working draft barring any objections from the committee so moved please present your bill thank you madam chair this language also is a result of a compromise reach with the district attorney's council two years ago we did a pretty decent overhaul of the expungement statutes and this is more of just kind of housekeeping and we had some unintended consequences that came along with that so these are really just minor tweaks and adjustments if anybody has any real specific questions i'll ask the chair for the latitude to bring in an attorney that practices primarily in the expungement area because it can quickly get over my head but be glad to accept questions do we have any questions for representative williams do pass representative biggs do you have a question yes yes you're recognized thank you madam chairman representative williams you say this is cleanup language but you are now adding an expunge of an opportunity for a felon after 15 years that wasn't in the current law and that wasn't in prior law i mean you're actually making some new law here for felony expungements correct uh we already have some felony expungement that is available that was actually added in a couple years ago the first time we had allowed some soft felonies to be expunged but i'll let if the chair will allow mr ridley explained how that language ended up there and how it ended up being a part of the compromise of the dac if you would introduce yourself before you michael risley expungement attorney the felony expungements were allowed with a partner with a pardon from the governor since the last bill was passed in november 2012 so we haven't added anything new there what we've done here is included if somebody has a misdemeanor conviction along with the felony conviction that's over 15 years old then they can also be expunged the reason we did that was because if one person has a felony conviction and they get a pardon they can get expunged another person with a felony conviction but who paid a public intox ticket when they were 18 years old that person can't be expunged and that seems sort of onerous do we have any further questions for representative williams scene none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second second do we have debate seeing them will vote preparing to close call the vote representative williams we will report this bill out as a due pass that may be a record for you two and oh in this committee two-and-oh in this committee or or just in this body or even to just have it heard right thank you madam chair for pointing out obviously [Laughter] house bill 2662 i believe it's a representative derby bill is being presented by representative biggs is that correct yes do we have a sub on this bill yes uh by acclimation we will accept that as the working draft barring any objections so moved representative biggs you are recognized to present house bill 2662 he just said he wanted to pull that bill no i looked over and i said he wants to pull that bill woofers in it and if represent derby wants to do something different he can but members this bill is essentially some of the amendments last year on the dui bill it's truly a cleanup some of you can see it's very confusing for other members to follow the current dui law so we worked with the house of legal staff and somewhat brought it into current statute and made it easier to read with this bill the second bill was totally something different do we have any questions for representative biggs on house bill 2662 yeah i don't think so representative morrissette was that a yes yes you are recognized 2662 right representative biggs yes sir well let's let's go over some of the changes in the law that it's doing if it's cleanup let's talk about let's just find out what i mean there's a whole would you believe a whole section you rewritten from page three all the way to page 14 you're striking entire sections of law rewritten those sections try to give the committee a summary of what has been added or what's been deleted from those pages last year you know we passed the per se dui drugs we passed some other dui laws and those were just kind of inserted in there this new section of law basically spells out the penalty for dui alcohol dui drugs and then restates the punishment for each follow-up yeah madam chair i may have a series of follow-up questions i have any of the punishments increased from present law for example and maybe i didn't catch it before but on page 19 it's uh let's see manslaughter in the first degree turn it with page 20 let not less than five and not to exceed 20 in a 10 000 fight is that presently existing law yes sir it is okay there was a question i had on one of these pages about assessment costs is anything changed there any additional uh assessment language the bill that had all of the changes was 26.63 however representative derby and has agreed to pull that bill what i had done is convinced him to make the changes in that bill and truly use this as a cleanup bill okay so in essence if i my missed chair this is clearly clean up and there isn't any draconian changes to title 47 that is completely my understanding do we have any other questions for representative biggs representative graw does that mean yes see no further questions do we have a motion we have a second do we have any debate nothing preparing to close call the vote 13 009 representative biggs we will report 2662 out as a due pass representative johnson are you ready to present house bill 2691 i'm as ready as i'll ever be and do you have a committee sub i do not then let's go all right with with permission of the chair i will not offer a committee sub members uh either last year the year before we ran a bill for limit of liability for public gun clubs gun ranges and gun stores limiting a liability for someone who accidentally shoots themselves in one of those places this is a similar bill but it goes to private property owners that have gun clubs and gun ranges and private property owners where they allow somebody to come hunt on their property it limits the liability if somebody has an accident and i'll be glad to take any questions do we have any questions for representative johnson do pass see no questions we have a do pass in a second will we have debate seen them we'll vote preparing to close call the vote representative johnson will report 2691 out as a due pass representative mccall you're up for two bills house bill 2837 do you have a committee sub on this bill i believe we have an amendment we have an amendment okay would you like to explain the bill first or they have the amendment read does not matter we can start with the amendment if you like okay clerk will read madame chair i moved to amend house bill 2837 page 9 section 5 line 11 and a half of the bill by inserting a new subsection d to read as follows d a demand letter or civil action that includes a claim for relief rising under 35 usc section 271 e2 shall not be subject to the requirements of this act amendment submitted by representative mccall does anyone have any questions on the amendment for representative mccall representative stiles thank you madam chair representative mccall can you tell us what 35 usc section 271 e2 says please representative that that address is patents and the pharmaceutical and biological area which really this bill does not pertain to so we're asking the amendment asked to exempt those from the purview of this bill you have a follow-up thank you madam chair uh why are we exempting them specifically from this i'm for your bill but i just need to know why the the bill my bill primarily deals with technology we've had we did have a representative from pharmaceutical industry object to a raised question about pharmaceutical patents being addressed with this legislation i don't see that it has i don't see any problem with exempting them do we have any further questions on the amendment see none barring any objections we'll accept it by acclimation as part of the bill so move back on the bill if you would like to explain it thank you madam chair uh house bill 2837 is a request bill from the oklahoma bankers association uh it addresses uh bad faith patent infringement claims basically just gives courts some direction on why what might be a legitimate infringement claim versus a bad faith infringement claim be happy to answer questions do we have any questions for representative mccall too see no questions we have a do pass in a second while we have debate scene done we'll vote preparing to close call the vote uh representative mccall will report house bill 2837 out as a due pass and you are recognized to present house bill 2840 do you have a sub on this bill i don't believe so okay you're recognized to present it thank you madam chair committee members house bill 2840 is a dac request bill currently only persons who are on felony probation and supervised by doc are prohibited from possessing firearms this amendment would extend that prohibition to offenders whose probation is supervised by third parties as well do we have any questions for representative mccall on house bill 2840 see no questions we have a due pass do we have a second do we have debate we'll open the queue for voting preparing to close call the vote zero representative mccall we will report house bill 2840 out as a due pass thank you madam chairman representative newell you are recognized to present house bill 2873 i believe you have a sub or an amendment a committee sub uh barring any objections we will accept that as our working draft by acclimation so moved you are recognized to present house bill 2873 thank you madam chair colleagues this bill simply uh extends uh protection to religious fluid university student organizations we have to take any questions do we have any questions for representative newell it's a committee it's a new language representative crawl you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair thank you representative newell i want to make sure this doesn't apply to our our private universities just the public institutions of higher education correct i believe that is correct do we have any further questions on the new bill representative moore said is that a yes that's a down representative inman you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair representative newell did you consult with the chancellor's office at all or anybody in in higher ed before you i did not know as you might be aware this committee said was just filed a day we we added the language early this morning and so i have not did you have a follow-up representative inman yeah thank you madam chair so it is has there been an instance recently that's been problematic and so you're trying to reach out and try to protect yes and in 2011 the christian legal society at ou uh the the the campus was going to kind of yank their stewarding session status because they were requiring their members and officers to basically signed a commitment of you know that they were christians and etc so uh that was resolved without any litigation but we just want to prevent those things from happening in the future it's basically a freedom of association type thing i mean you know this is going to be extended to to all religious groups but it would be the same thing if i was uh if i had a humane society or a peta type club we wouldn't want like a michael vick being the president of that so representative sheary are recognized for a question thank you chairman i really haven't read this very closely but this this really means we can get into the same scenario kind of like we have with the satan monument here at the capitol on the that proposal that uh any religious group is going to have some pretty significant protections under this bill is that correct correct you got to take the better with the suite yes do we have any further questions for representative newell see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a second islamic students and do we have any debate seen them we'll vote representative newell we will report house bill 2873 out as a due pass thank you madam chair thank you members representative graw you are recognized to present house bill 2903 i believe it does have a committee sub that's correct uh barring any objections we will by acclimation accept that as the working draft so moved you are you are recognized to present house bill 2903 thank you madam chair thank you committee members house bill 2903 actually provides some definitions for what is prohibited under article 5 section 46 of the constitution and the definitions relate to local and special laws i'd be happy to answer any questions do we have any questions for representative graham representative morrissette you're recognized all right representative what are we doing here what are we trying to prevent or what are we trying to promote we're trying to provide definitions for what is prohibited by the constitution that is the passage of special laws or local laws those are not defined anywhere in statute uh follow-up no thank you thank you madam chair was that a yes yes okay just check him hang on a second and we on the right bill is it 2903 yes it is committee sub for 29.03 i guess representative for the purpose i'm just going to read it because for the purposes of title 75 the open statutes which is the administrative procedures code correct administrative procedures act title 75 of the oklahoma statutes correct right the constitutional provisions found in section 46 of article 5. what is article section 46 dealing with the prohibition of local especially what court case or situation has arisen recently where this has become an issue oh i don't know that there is a a recent court case or situation okay why are we doing it then i mean what what's the need was that a follow-up uh just came out i don't oh mr morris said i'll be hand i'll be happy to answer his question if the chair would like for me too i will give you that latitude thank you so much i don't want it to become an issue and so i think that the more guidance that we provide in statute to the courts regarding the words that we have in law the less issues that we have down the road and so all we are doing is providing definitions for special law as it's contemplated under article 5 section 46 representative styles you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair i try to abide by the separation of powers as much as possible how is it that we can the role of the judicial branch i believe is to interpret our laws how is it that we can by statute define a constitutional term i mean essentially couldn't we say that if the word blue was in the constitution essentially what we're doing if the word blue was in the constitution we could pass a statute that says by blue we mean yellow isn't that essentially what we're doing no it although i do see your point i mean we just passed the patent trolling bill that relates to oklahoma statutes although most if not all patent cases are brought in federal court and controlled by the sherman act so i'm not sure exactly when the statute that we just passed will come into play when we're talking about violations of federal law so i could see kind of what you're saying however the court does look to statute and look to what the legislate what the legislature intends for the purpose of interpreting different areas including constitutional law the oklahoma constitution follow up thank you madam chair well i don't think referring to a law that we passed in here takes away from anything that i've said no i i agree i agree i'm saying that i see your point it's a bit similar to my example do we have any further questions for representative graw see none chair would entertain a motion do we have a motion do we have a second uh do we have any debate see none we'll vote i'm sorry preparing to close call the vote [Music] representative graw we will squeak that one out as a do pass and i believe you have another one further down that's an hjr would you like to present that while you're here yes you would like for me to let's do hjr 1088 do you have a sub on this yes ma'am barn any objections by acclimation we'll accept that as a working draft so moved you're recognized to present htr 108 a thank you madam chair thank you members this actually will be a ballot or a state question relating to the single subject rule it actually adds language to the constitution that says that a single subject is two different items that are within the same title of law if there are things that are not within the same title then there essentially has to be a statement or a finding that the legislature votes on separately that says why these things are related and the purpose is to obviously avoid log rolling or cases alleging violation of the single subject rule be happy to answer any questions do we have any questions we do representative styles you're recognized thank you madam chair i'm a big believer in precedence based on the precedent that you just set in the bill right before this why couldn't we do this by statute why do we have to take this as a constitutional amendment but not the other two it's a great question in fact house bill 2905 started as a statutory provision that i think had pretty close to the same language as what you see in hjr 1088 however what i mean we are actually providing um in my opinion kind of the operative language for the single subject rule which is included in the section right above so that's why i see a constitutional change necessary here as opposed to pure definitions which is what we provided in the in the previous legislation did you have a follow-up representative shira you're recognized for a question thank you chairman and this will go kind of to representative stiles and his question on the last measure just because you get a majority of this legislature to say that a weed is a rose it's not a rose so that legislative statement that gets passed by a majority of the members of this body may in fact i mean it's going to be controlling then even if it is it's presumption it's not controlling it's just a presumption a rebuttable one representative williams you're recognized for a question is that a pass okay representative edwin you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair representative i'm trying to understand why this is even necessary because if fast is prologue um the supreme court has been clear that members of your team have violated the oklahoma state constitution over and over and over again such that they had to finally say we have grown weary of telling you how to run the thing so if we pass this and this now becomes part of the oklahoma constitution is there any guarantee that your team would even listen to this and make sure that we pass constitutional laws since it has been evident according to the supreme court that you have continued to violate the constitution year after year after year i'm almost tempted not to dignify that question with a response but i will actually the court has been inconsistent over the last several several years decades and arguably the last ruling that we've received did not provide much clarification so i have an idea for you why don't we help the court out and we pass legislation that is so simple even a legislature could understand it and we say if they're within the same title of law they're presumed to be the same subject representative morissette do you have a question similar aspects of that whether one would you believe is a democrat or republican as time marches on as as we start playing with the constitutional language thereof i find it i find it problematic and dangerous but one of my specific problems with your language it talks about on page two and it's in your in your proposed title i mean your uh the measure to the the voters it talks about is presumed to contain only one subject presumed is problematic includes a statement or explanation of the logical connection between and among amen i mean this is this is stuff that belongs in a legislative debate not inside the basic fundamental constitution well you may disagree with me but i suggest representative in all due respect that the language that's in the constitution now that the court you claim did not give clarification which i disagree i thought it was very clear i said arguably okay that as we go as time goes by and all of us are no longer here that what's in our basic constitution today gives us safeguards for the future this becomes a political statement incorrect you're incorrect right well i know but i think there was a question in there so i'll attempt to answer it what we what we have right now is several challenges and cases we have close calls practically every year maybe they're not close calls for some but they are for others whether there is a whether there is a single subject violation so instead of wasting our time with these close calls with these challenges why don't we put language out there that actually simplifies it and says if they're within the same title or if we find that say it has to do with trust under section 63 or excuse me title 63 or title 59 that we can find by whatever two-thirds or three-fourths that they're actually related it's a single subject it actually simplifies it down the road for the future and prosperity and everything else that you're concerned with do we still have questions we're going to be here a while pipe now are you being serious representative echols you're recognized for a question thank you uh madam chairman permission for a richard moore set very brief series of follow-ups if i allowed it to richard i'll allow it to you would uh would you believe that prior to the republicans taking uh taking the majority that there were in fact laws that were thrown out under the single subject rule i would believe that in fact i believe that to be a fact it's a shocker um would you agree that the process of the legislature going through and stating what the subject is if it's in multiple titles is probably a good thing we want the legislature to do that absolutely that's a good thing that's why we're proposing it in the bill and i think that addresses some of the concerns not just of the court but what we've heard already here today and and would you believe as i've said on multiple occasions i'm a fan of the court and if you were to actually put the legislative intent inside a bill with multiple subjects well the court would be bound to consider that in their interpretation correct you know i think that they would consider it but to your point there's a presumption and that presumption can absolutely be overcome if for some reason we have a legislature that goes absolutely haywire and is saying that these two totally unrelated things are a single subject that can be overcome if challenged well and and in fact and and so you know i'm for your con i'm for your hjr wouldn't it make sense for those who have said they want to protect the dignity of the court to pass this very common sense legislation that would be the allow the people would you believe i asked for richard morrissette series and that that if you say you want to protect the dignity of the court you should allow the people the opportunity to have the legislature speak and have it be a presumption well at the same time leaving final decision-making authority with the court absolutely and what this does is it avoids litigation and challenges down the road because it provides common sense parameters not just for the legislature but also that citizens can understand and certainly for the court to use in their jurisprudence representative jordan you're recognized for a question thank you madam chairman representative is this essentially just gutting the single subject provision in the constitution no i i don't think so and again this is this is language that i've worked on with our former speaker's office that i've worked with with um judges attorneys outside groups to try and put them our minds together on how do we how do we clarify the single subject rule so that we don't have something that our court says and i know opinion that may have been different 20 years ago follow up follow up i guess my my main concern here is we are we are allowing now if this passes more than one title to be included in a bill we've always operated under the assumption that it all has to be in one title now it says here um that it leads me to believe that you could have more than one title of law in the same bill do you think that this is going to create the problems that the the drafters of the constitution wanted to prevent and that was bartering and horse trading if you will of let's do this and that and add them together so you can't vote no no just just the opposite and in my time here we have not always just had bills that dealt with one title of law we have had bills that have many different titles of law included and in fact there may be times when that's appropriate and that's necessary again there are different types of public trust that can be set up under title 63 and those that can be set up under title 59 they're related they're very similar and it would make sense if we're going to fix one that would fix the other and we could do that in one bill and not have to do do two different pieces of legislation this actually would put the burden on us representative that if we say that we we have to provide a statement that says this is why we're including these two provisions in the same bill and therefore it's clear not just to us it's clear to our citizens it's clear to everyone that these were related there's no question about it and again that's a rebuttable presumption of challenged follow-up one more follow-up in the example on a trust i i can see how that might come differently but the way this is written i think it could be expanded far beyond something that makes sense like that and could really just essentially render that provision of the constitution moot i think i think it has the opposite effect because right now there's nothing that prohibits the legislature this body or the one across the rotunda from passing these bills and and that are arguably related there's no statement that ties them together we trust the author to tell us that they're related i mean there's all sorts of room for interpretation if you will this actually removes the inconsistency in the wiggle room and it says if they're in the same title they're presumed to be if they're not in the same title you vote and you prove it up that they're related and they're a single subject it can still be challenged representative styles you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair several but just stop me please whenever you get and we do have six in the queue i'm hoping if we do one question one follow-up on these that maybe we can just move into debate since we've been here for three hours so go ahead thank you and i have sincere questions about this i think this is a such an important issue we should carefully consider it representative my first question is can you cite to me the supreme court decision that says that simply because it's in multiple titles it's unconstitutional because i've read those opinions and i don't think the supreme court was saying because it's in they're in multiple titles they're unconstitutional is there something that says that or is there more no i i agree with you that there's no bright line test that the courts applied okay okay so thank you ma'am chair um but aren't aren't titles well this basically says if it's in this kind of matter of fiction because we're not i don't i don't know that we're ever obligated to follow what the titles of the statute say for example the paternity statutes are in marriage and family they regard neither marriage nor family but yet paternity is addressed there used to be in the children's code and we moved it so titles essentially are arbitrary and if i wanted to i could create my own title of law call it title aaron and just put miscellaneous things in there isn't that a legal possibility something we could do here this very moment i'm going to pull you back to the bill and put it back to get to it then i will tie it all together it's a rebuttable presumption that's what thank you i knew you were going to say that because that's my next question because that's the answer to that question perfect explain to me how a rebuttable presumption works because i know how it works in a trial courts i am having difficulty understanding how a rebuttable presumption works with the supreme court because number one i think every single bill we pass is a rebuttable as a rebuttable presumption that isn't in fact a law so you're telling me the supreme court is going to sit there and think well i have to take this and i have to presume this is constitutional but if i can come up with something to say this is it this is unconstitutional then i can rebut this presumption are we asking the supreme court to do something that makes no sense whatsoever they're taking everything as a rebuttable presumption right already no the the fact of the matter is if it falls under these parameters it's presumed to be single subject and then it would be the party challenging that with clear and convincing evidence to show that it's not a single subject to show that these are two totally unrelated or that it was essentially log rolling which is what happens in every case representative john singer recognized for a question thank you i'll try not to be so verbose as some of the recent questioners representative graw not being familiar with the law as an attorney would be has any oklahoma statute ever been overturned because of log rolling in the same section has that ever occurred in history that you're aware of in in the same title same title that's a good question and i'm not familiar enough with the case law to answer that that goes to representative stiles point that you could have two different laws within the same title that are so completely different that they're not a single subject and that's why absolutely it could still be challenged and if that's the case it'll be overturned thank you madam chairman representative in many are recognized for a question thank you madam chair so a 9-0 decision with winchester and edmondson on the same side is not close first of all second of all to representative eccles point uh when our team passed laws that were unconstitutional we didn't come back and try to rewrite what the single subject rule was so that's important to note too representative echoes but finally i'll say this if you take the bill that has brought this to the forefront today representative grah the tax cut and the capital repairs under your legislation going back to what representative jordan said a minute ago when all you've got to do is come in and give some sort of logical explanation as to a logical connection between and among the laws could you not come in and say well we are passing a tax cut and therefore we're gonna um and as we cut taxes we're using the bond we have to we have to pass a bond because we don't have the the gr funds and so instead of paying for the for the capital repairs outright uh because of the tax cut we're now required to do the bond and therefore that's the logical connection between the two and in reality we have to put them together because we can't get people to vote for a bond but we're hoping the supreme court will ignore the single subject rule follow your logical connection i can stop it stop you right there in your hypothetical you're asking the supreme court to ignore the log rolling the anti-log rolling provision right so you're saying that the statement that would have to be voted on and approved by a simple majority would absolutely already be in violation of the single subject and so you've already provided the prima facie case the clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption and so that would be challenged just like the bill was challenged this last time around it would be overturned if that's if that's your hypothetical so it had the same result and the unconstitutional law would not stand at this point we would like to see if there's a motion to be made and then move into debate do we have a motion we have a due past we have a second do we have debate yes okay we have representative styles against anyone else you have to get next view we will have two minutes for representatives representative styles against two minutes for representative graf four okay you are recognized representative styles thank you madam chair well i understand what we're trying to do here unfortunately we've not accomplished anything i don't feel we we are defining single subjects by our processes not by the content of the actual bill do you understand that we're saying this is this this is single subject if we do a b and c it's not looking at the actual bill itself and determining whether it violates a single subject and i understand people are frustrated by the supreme court but i'm not sure this is something we can define i can't remember who said it but i don't know what this is but i i i can identify it when i see it we can't plug everything we do up here into a cotton picking equation we have to use our brains just like the supreme court has to use their brains to determine whether or not we have violated the single subject rule and just because we're mad at the supreme court doesn't mean we change our constitution in the process republicans won't we start women's winning some elections why don't we start putting republican judges in seats if we're so upset at the judicial branch of government we're just hacking at the leaves of evil rather than striking at the roots this doesn't do anything i have to stick to my constitutional law class in the separation of powers and not dictate to the supreme court how to do their job because i think if statistically speaking i think we've screwed up here a lot more than the supreme court has representative growl you're recognized for debate if we return to the separation of powers we know that each branch has its own individual role the legislature writes the laws the supreme court or the court system whether that be district court appellate court they interpret the laws well if we don't provide them the definitions or the guidance then it's subject to interpretation we can assist the courts and ultimately assist the parties that have brought something to resolution if we clarify and that means whether we clarify the statutes or in this case we clarify the constitution what i'd like to see is us do a better job here when it comes to single subject and i think we can and i think this helps accomplish that because again if we're looking at two different laws that involve different titles then they're going to provide for greater scrutiny we're going to have to have a majority of this body that's going to have to approve and look at the content of the bills just like you said look at the content now if they're in the same title it's a little bit easier to do but again that's not set in stone it can still be challenged and it can still be overcome and that's the court's job but certainly we'd be remiss and we would not be doing our job if we have something here the single subject rule that has been subject to interpretation one way or the other depending on who those nine people are that sit across the street we're not doing our job unless we answer that question and that's what we have to do today it's very simple it really there is there's nothing hidden here this has nothing to do with punishing or being mad at the court and great friends that sit over there i think they do a great job they're very intelligent people and they work very hard all we're saying is that we can set up some prime parameters that show what a single subject is and so maybe we don't get into these fights down the road and have to take them to the court thank you for your vote we will open the queue for voting who was that are they in representative growl did you uh prepare any clothes call the vote representative this hjr will remain property of the committee at this time we'll go to somebody that always presents easy bills three bills of representative aaron's style after that now i would like everyone to remember how well we've done so far we have done we're going to start with an important bill that really was it was we're going to start with house bill 2998 an open records bill i believe you have a committee committee sub barring any objections we will accept the committee sub as a working draft so moved representative styles you recognized present house bill 2998 thank you madam chair this is the um open records bill when it comes to court records there's two parts basically i'm setting a standard when it comes to when judges seal records and also allowing the supreme court to um promulgate rules so that we have uniform display of all records online i'll be happy to take questions do we have any questions for representative styles representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair i my l.a missed the committee said can you tell me the difference between the committee sub and the original oh well they're they're totally so amazingly different it's not even bothered to go over the original was basically a change that it was a shell bill so okay never mind is that easier way to say it it was a show bill okay representative jordan you're recognized for a question thank you man chairman okay i'm confused here now is the because i don't have a committee sub showing up on the computer does this bill still apply to the judicial nominating committee no it does not it was the show bill because that was the open records and it has nothing to do this is completely separate deal i'll say this there's no objection that i've heard i've worked with the people across the street on this every district judge i've talked to loves it i haven't heard a single person that's against it we worked hard in working with the judicial branch of government on this basically it be honest it somewhat provides them cover from being asked by politics being played to seal records and so what we've done is we've set us a record or a standard and if they seal a record then they need to provide the reason for sealing the record do we have any further questions for representative styles see none do we have a motion do we have a second a second can you second your own bill just did will we have any debate he goes in here this evening see none will chairs preparing to close the queue call to vote representative styles house bill 2998 will be out reported out as a due pass we'll now hear house bill 3000. do you have a committee settlement barring any objections we will utilize the committee sub as the working draft by acclimation so moved you're recognized to present your bill thank you madam chair this allows the mediation program and mediators to simply disclose whether or not a person has participated in mediation not the results this is done because oftentimes in contract cases there is a conditioned precedent to bring in the claim that they've attempted to mediate and so if a party has failed to respond to the attempts to mediate this allows the mediator say they didn't return my calls so that condition precedent has been fulfilled do we have any questions on this bill representative williams you're recognized thank you madam chair i just the only difference i saw between your committee sub and in the as introduced version was and as introduced you said mediator shall and in the in the sub you said mediation program are are you like i go to a private mediator for a lot of my domestic cases yeah basically yeah i know what you're talking about basically i believe that i don't think i believe this particular section of law refers specifically to the the mediation program that's sponsored by the supreme courts i think private mediators are not under those obligation but the mediation program by the supreme court was absolute disclosure of nothing and so this is responding that's the program that we're referring to so early settlement mediation i think is the technical term for it do we have any further questions on this bill seen them we'd entertain a motion do we have a second chair makes a second do we have any debate seen them will vote any further voting call the vote representative styles two for oh let's go to house bill 3001 do we have an amendment on this as well there is an amendment not a committee sub okay would you clerk read the amendment please madam chair i moved to amend house bill 3001 page 5 section 1 lines 10 by striking the words beginning with the non-custodial parent all the way through line 12 and inserting the following the court

amendment submitted by representative stiles representative styles does anyone have any question on this amendment the amendment only seeing them will accept the amendment by acclamation barring any objections so moved you are back on to recognize sir to explain your bill thank you madam chair this bill well basically the amendment explained the bill um this bill allows the court's discretion um a party cannot unilaterally not pay child support but allows the court's discretion where a party has absconded with the child it's basically said i don't need you and the court may relieve a person

in the last four bills representative jordan you're recognized to present house bill 3254 is there a committee sub on this bill no okay go ahead uh members what this bill does is it gives uh the state 90 days to answer a uh an application on this that's regarding ineffective assistance of counsel right now that's a 30-day response period it's just not enough time to go through the files they usually get an extension from the court and this disallows the 90 days so you don't have to go through the extension process do we have any questions for representative jordan on the bill see no questions we have a do pass and a second will we have debate seen them we'll open the queue for voting call the vote representative jordan will report house bill 3254 out as a due pass representative echols 3368 do we have a committee sub we do not feel free to explain your bill thank you madam chairman this bill creates a the ability to do a disclosure form when selling a vehicle as is it's

have a due pass do we have a second and do we have any debate i can't strike we'll open the queue for voting and just so i can tell the committee i forgot i am going to take this i've made a commitment to strike title okay i have a strike title chair's preparing to close the queue call the vote representative echols will report house bill 3368 as the due pass representative biggs house bill 3394 do we have a committee sub we will accept that as the working draft proclamation barring any objections thank you long day uh recognized thank you madam chairman members house bill 3394 deals with a situation that most people believe is already against the law but it is not on the books this would create a misdemeanor for an officer taking cash payments for fines or cost on the side of the road that i'd be happy to answer any questions do we have any questions for representative biggs representative sherry you're recognized for a question thank you chairman i forgot to ask you about this last night or maybe it didn't come up come in my mind but what about a civil penalty or something i mean it or when this happened happens is it a criminal type situation where it's these officers pocketing the money i mean should this be a criminal act i believe it should be a criminal act you know in this situation i know one agency is under investigation for officers taking money and when i was asking around and trying to determine if this was a problem i had two state agencies tell me that they regularly do this in the field and i believe that's an issue that should be addressed representative johnson you're recognized for a question thank you madam chairman there is a a city in my district that allegedly when an officer gives them a speeding ticket when they go in to pay it they are told that if they'll write a second check for an amount of money that the violation will not be reported to their insurance company would this cover that kind of action no no this uh and i know the situation you're talking about this will not cover that this will cover if an officer is on the side of the road and says you can pay me right now 100 civil assessment and i'll take care of that and you hand him 100 cash officers not allowed to take cash payments in the field follow up follow up would you perhaps help me with a future bill with that particular issue that i think you and i know about yes sir thank you thank you madam chair do we have any further questions for representative biggs we have a due pass do we have a second do we have any debate will commence to

voting a quorum is declared before moving on we have a guest with us today she is a bismarck native and she says she's coming back soon sedalia mallam she's a page in the united states senate with united states senator heidi heitkamp she's here with us today and she attends century high school welcome to the [Applause] senate so i'll be on the third order business reference to the journal madam secretary mr president your committee on correction and revision of the journal senator pullman chairman has carefully examined the journal of the 57th day and recommends that it be corrected as follows and when so correct it recommends that it be approved page 988 line 48 replace passed with failed senator pullman move that the report be adopted the question is on the report of the committee on correction and revision of the journal as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the report is adopted switching to the sixth order of business first matter for consideration by the senate this afternoon under the sixth order house bill 1249 senator triplett mr president senate bill 1249 is a bill out of your senate energy and natural resources committee and um i would ask people to listen carefully to the amendments because once you have understood the amendments which are pretty well interspersed with the bill the um the discussion on the bill itself will be quite brief this bill uh regards the missouri river and the um establishment of an advisory council to the governor and the legislature regarding the many issues around the missouri river and i think to help in the discussion i'm just going to take us back to 1944 for just a minute and talk about the flood control act of 1944 which as i hope everyone knows including any students who might be present is the the law which established the system of reservoirs on the missouri river primarily for flood control however in addition to flood control the congress authorized seven additional uses for the river some of which are in conflict with others in addition to flood control the other uses are navigation which we don't do much of up here but it happens elsewhere on the river irrigation which was once a bond dream of many in north dakota and has not come to much fruition so far public parks and recreational facilities conservation of fish wildlife forests and other natural resources individual and domestic use of water and industrial use of water sometimes referred to altogether as water supply electric power generation which as you know is hydropower and water quality in the sense of reducing erosion and sedimentation into the river so we have the federal government through the u.s army corps of engineers that manages the flood control part of it we have the um secretary of agriculture the u.s secretary of agriculture which is in charge of preventing erosion and sedimentation we have the bureau of reclamation which was charged with establishing the irrigation which never happened very much in north dakota we developed the garrison diversion conservancy district to sort of manage the state part of it and of course we have the state of north dakota which has interests in maintaining pre-existing rights to the flow of the river we have cities and counties along the river we have groups of folks who have learned to love the recreation on the river and the fishing we have conservation groups who care about the um conservation of the resources in and around and along the reservoir and the river so um there are a lot of interests and the bill as it came to us as you can see suggested that this advisory group was going to create a unified vision for north dakota and that was the first thing that caught my mind because i think not likely so we in the committee worked to um streamline this bill a little bit and to maybe be a little more realistic about what's possible and i think before you say that i'm just a pessimist in thinking about the ability of any of all of these groups to agree i'm just going to share with you a few of the phrases that actually come from the flood control act of 1944 which helps us to understand that congress understood all those many years ago that these are seriously conflicting interests flood control of course takes priority because that was the reason that congress put all of the money into the dams on the missouri navigation in the act says and i'm going to skip some of the language that doesn't connect here but it says the use for navigation shall only be such use as does not conflict with any beneficial consumptive use present or future so navigation is put somewhere down the list um that one just talks about other people being involved excuse me the public park and recreation usage says specifically no use of any area to which this section applies shall be permitted which is inconsistent with the laws for the protection of fish and game of the state in which such area is situated so game and fish trumps public recreation on the topic of the sale of hydropower that may be produced the law says preference in the sale of such power and energy shall be given to public bodies and cooperatives on the topic of sale of surplus water to the public states and municipalities many of you may know from just paying attention to issues over the last several years that that um the idea of the army corps of engineers selling water to our state or municipalities is in conflict with north dakota's position and and the position of many other states along the river that we have an absolute right to the use of the the annual flow of the water of the river as though the dams were not even there and so so that was kind of the basis for our conversation about this potential advisory committee which is that we don't have any expectation that a group of volunteer advisors is going to get together and get everybody singing kumbaya these are our interests in water which are inherently in conflict and so it's it's the position of the committee in reviewing and and rewriting this um this bill that the most we can expect from an advisory committee is that they would coordinate communication among stakeholders and and hopefully that they would coordinate a respectful and civil conversation so that's the starting point and then as the bill as it came to us had many many many people actually on the committee and we thought you know smaller is probably better in this situation and so we significantly reduced the number of people on the committee and you can see the list that we came up with which really is kind of just a very general statement of each of the authorized uses of the river um with the idea that those people who are appointed to this committee would be able to engage their own stakeholders and and bring anyone to the table really who wanted to be these would of course their meetings would all be public meetings and anyone who wanted to engage could the one area that's not specifically in the flood control act which we added was a representative of historic and cultural values protection and that's because there is uh so much erosion of our cultural history around the edges of the lake that that we thought that was an important topic to add in um we did change the tribal interests to an invitation rather than a directive on the theory that we in the state of north dakota don't really have the right to direct the um uh tribal chairs to be part of our commissions but we certainly want them to be invited to the table if they choose to come and then on in terms of the duties and the responsibilities of the commission um in the testimony that we received there were there was quite a range of of their the perception of people who have an intense interest in the missouri river of what they thought they were going to do and and it ranged from the modest um in terms of coordinating um conversations to the rather grandiose um some suggestion that this committee would be authorized to um negotiate with the corps of engineers on behalf of the state and we thought that was rather more in the in the governor's wheelhouse and um and some suggestion that they would protect and defend the state's interest in the missouri river and we thought that was really in the attorney general's um job description so we did tone down some of the rhetoric in the in the bill and um let's see toward the end there's um when we are looking at what what they're doing um we referred to the authorized purposes defined in the flood control act and then kept the um sort of closing phrase of any other existing or potentially beneficial uses and we thought that between those two phrases we pretty well covered the entire universe and therefore didn't have to have other examples of current hot topics in there so um as i indicated the the amendment is a pretty complete rewrite of the bill the committee um voted in favor of it i believe 7-0 and requests your concurrence any further discussion hearing none the questions on the proposed amendment to house bill 1249 as many senators are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the amendments are adopted senator kline oh mr president may we be on the eighth order without objection will be on the eighth order senator klein mr president i move that house bill 1249 not be re-referred to appropriation but be placed immediately at the top of the 14th order for second reading and final passage questions on the motion of senator klein as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed nay motion carries therefore the senate will shift to the 14th order to consider house bill 1249 now as amended madam secretary in gross house bill 1249 with senate amendments a bill for an act to create and enact chapter 61 of the century code relating to the creation of missouri river advisory council the set bared my pardon i'm going to pass off to rachel senator triplett mr president i'm pleased that this bill has been rolled over to be heard in its entirety today because that means i don't have to repeat everything i just said so i think that the explanation on the sixth order was quite thorough and um i will stand for questions but otherwise i would simply um request that the senate concur in the recommendation of energy and natural resources for a do pass on house bill 1249. further discussion hearing none the questions on the final passage of house bill 1249 with the secretary please open the key each senator record your vote all senators have voted any senator wish to change their vote secretary will close the key final tally on house bill 1249 reveals 42 senators voting yeah four senators voting nay one senator absent not voting the bill is passed back to the sixth order house bill 1358 senator armstrong mr president um house bill 1358 is the pipeline monitoring safety bill it's quite thorough i even took notes it may look familiar to senate bill 2374 which we passed earlier in the session and had similar language dealing with the new requirements for pipeline monitoring and leak detection in addition the house version combined the best parts of fine five land over landowner related bills into the into 1358 we'll discuss those on the 14th order the amendments are section 1 qualifies well everything is underground it also adds language to include the above ground pieces of a pipeline and ensure that they are under the uh purview of the north or ndic in that leaks can leaks can be caused not only from the underground stuff but also from the above ground stuff uh from the parts of the pipeline that are above ground section two clarifies that within 60 days of putting a crude oil and produced water pipeline into service that the company must file with the north north dakota industrial commission final construction and design specifications a certified certificate of hydrostatic and pneumatic testing from an independent inspector and a plan for leak detection and monitoring this is valuable information for the agency to have for any pipeline going into service it also removes the specific requirements for flow meters and over pressure protection devices these aspects are addressed by the study and new rule requirements in section 8 of the bill on page 3 starting on line 11 it this authorizes the commission to use the abandoned well fund to clean up legacy spills from pre-august 1 1983 when the regulations were put in place it also removes removes the adversely affected language and replaces it with impacted defining what land is impacted is easier than determining what is adversely affected removes land that has been willfully and it also removes land that has been willfully degraded by the surface owner from eligibility for restoration section 4 is just clarifying what transferring is section 5 relocates new language at the end of the bill for a better or at the end of the section for a better fit section six changes shall to may and allows for release of the information upon request and makes a technical correction on into section eight is inserting crude oil lines that was just an oversight by the drafter and requires that the erc study include an analysis to determine the feasibility and cost effectiveness of requiring leak detection and monitoring technology on the expansion of existing pipeline systems this is a big issue when trying to determine what to do with existing pipelines that are expanded and to access whether it's possible and effective to add modern monitoring technology to just a new portion of the line or the entire system nobody seems to have an answer for this question that's why we're studying it and then section section 9 re is removing remediating and adding some more inclusive language the amendments and the bill passed 7-0 out of your natural resources committee and we'd ask this body to accept these amendments and move it down to appropriations any further discussion hearing none the questions on the proposed amendments to house bill 1358 as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the amendments are adopted house bill 1358 will be re-referred to senate appropriations continuing on the sixth order house bill 1474. senator nelson mr president this bill started out as a 93-page bill it listed about every election you could possibly have in the state of north dakota and obviously the people of the house didn't like 93 page bills because they sent us a one-page hog house bill and that bill was a study to check the feasibility and desirability of consolidating all political subdivision and school district elections with the state primary and general elections or to perhaps have some some specified dates that would cover any other elections that we needed to have well your gva committee was not too thrilled with that either so we present a second hog house to this bill and this one was rule germain because it deals with elections in that that in order to have a lot most elections you have to have precincts within your districts and in 2013 we did some major updates of what needs to be done because prior to that the state kind of ruled the party and told them they had to do this and they had to do that when they were running their their district elections and so we cleaned it up we thought last session except that we missed two things and so in looking in section 16.103 as to who could participate you realize we had a section that said basically anybody who voted or was affiliated with the party at the last general election could vote or if they intended to vote at the next election well all sorts of people intend to do things they don't necessarily do it but they intended to and if they say so then they could attend your convent your district convention and your caucus meetings well this basically now says that section of the code won't be there so we deleted that section the second one also is from 16.103 and it deals with the vacancies if precinct commitment now i remember several years ago that i didn't even know who the precinct committee when were we could elect like six or seven of them and we're supposed to notify your county auditor as to who they are and they are part of what makes up your district committee and if there's a vacancy in your party that district committee is supposed to choose the next person to be in the house or the senate well what we did in 2013 was we said we gave more rule more instruction to the state party and we told the state parties that by their own bylaws they could figure out a way to choose precinct committee people and so that's basically the change that's in 16.1 or 305 that instead of having the district district committee choose um however you've authorized it in your bylaws will choose now the minority party when when we have our district meetings all districts have bylaws some of those chose to write their own based on a particular structure and some personal needs for within that district if they chose not to we have a set of default bylaws that can be used by the other districts and that's what's been chosen to do but all of our districts have district bylaws and keep in mind if you say to suspend the rules that does not mean you can suspend your bylaws we've had some problems with those types of things but that's nothing that we get involved with here so the met the amendments to this particular bill um 1474 basically a hog house that deletes that intended to vote in the next election section and also authorizes you to use your party bylaws in in picking your replacement precinct committee person your gva committee gave this a 5-0 due pass and we request that you concur with the amendments and then a green light on the bill any further discussion hearing none the question is on the proposed amendments to house bill 1474 as many senators are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the amendments are adopted we'll switch to the 14th order house bill 1474 now as amended madam secretary engrossed house bill 1474 with senate amendments a bill for an act to amend and reenact section 16 of the north dakota century code relating to political organizations senator nelson mr president like i said uh what you just heard is what this bill is please vote green any further discussion hearing none the questions on the final passage of house bill 1474 with the secretary please open the key each senator record your vote all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary will close the key the final tally on house bill 1474 reveals 46 senators voting yeah one senator absent and not voting the bill is passed switching back to the sixth order house bill 1085 senator dever mr president house bill 1085 was introduced to require that executive branch agencies provide information to omb regarding federal money and reductions in federal money so that that can be accounted for in building the budget the amendments were offered by omb and largely in subsection one just kind of changes some of the language and shortens it a little bit but on lines 23 and 24 of page one uh the bill had indicated that if the reduction was more than five percent in the total federal funds the state agency receives and line 24 25 or more and omb pointed out to us that 25 is more than 5 percent so that wasn't real necessary another part of the amendment was that if the reductions in funds were because of a decrease in case loads or a change in uh completion date of a construction project or the completion of one time project funded those are not necessarily because of changes in the way that that uh federal funding flows but because of uh like a turn back and and then finally uh they they said the the original bill said that that those reports would be made in odd-numbered years which would mean after the session so that we changed it to even-numbered years so it would come before the session so with that mr president we would encourage adoption in the amendment any further discussion hearing none the questions on the proposed amendments to house bill 1085 as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed saying nay the amendments are adopted it'll switch to the 14th order house bill 1085 now is amended madam secretary house bill 1085 with senate amendments a bill for an act to create and enact a new section to chapter 54 of the north dakota century code relating to federal funds reporting requirements by state agencies and reports to the legislative management and to amend and reenact section 54 of the north dakota century code relating to federal grant applications reporting requirements by state agency senator deborah mr president i'm sure the appropriators among us have a great appreciation for the kind of information that they're provided by omb and also by legislative council this is important information to us omb came to us with some objection to the bill because they said and they provided us reports that they provide to the budget section those reports are generated actually by legislative council and done through a survey that legislative council does with executive branch agencies so the bill requires those agencies to provide that information to omb and your committee on government veterans affairs felt like that's not necessarily a duplication but but rather a requirement that agencies provide that to omb that they provide voluntarily at this time and we just thought that might be an appropriate way of doing it and we would encourage adoption of the bill for the discussion hearing none the questions on the final passage of house bill 1085 secretary please open the key each senator record your vote all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary will close the key the final tally on house bill 1085 reveals 45 senators voting yea one senator voting nay one senator absent not voting the bill is passed back to the sixth order house bill 1145 senator armstrong mr president house bill 1145 came to us because the office of the state engineer wanted this bill to ensure that water used in hydraulic fracturing industry is pumped under a valid permit and to aid the investigation of unauthorized use the amendments simply narrow the scope of the original bill to fit more narrowly tailor that request the amendment's passed 7-0 and i'll explain the bill on the 14th order further discussion none the questions on the proposed amendment to house bill 1145 as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the amendments are adopted we'll switch to the 14th order house bill 1145 now is amended madam secretary house bill 1145 with senate amendments a bill for an act to create and enact a new section to chapter 61 of the north dakota century code relating to tracking of water used for oil and gas development the fiscal note shows no impact senator armstrong mr president house bill 1145 comes from your natural resources committee with a 5-2 do not pass recommendation and quite frankly mr mr president um the bill is a regulation on the industry uh we only had one person testify in favor of the bill and it requires quite a bit of actually documentation and paperwork to be kept for a long period of time related to the under unauthorized use of water there were several examples given of how this could be a problem however as you all know in this body when serious issues arise in the industry our hearing room is usually packed whether it's with landowners or and if you want to combine oil oil development and water that usually can fill a room pretty quick that didn't happen on this bill and your natural resources committee thinks this would probably be better served as an administrative rule and even though this bill places a requirement in place there is no there's no penalty defined in the bill for what would happen if it's not enforced there's no enforcement provision and your natural resources committee by a vote of five to two felt that without some of that language and um without expressing a serious need for this for this legislation that was a good idea that it either ran through administrative rules so we voted five two do not pass and we'd ask this body to do the same senator triplett mr president i was one of the two who voted against the do not pass as the carrier said there was only one person who testified but it was the one person who um is in charge of managing that part of our state agency that deals with water use and permitting and so it seemed to me that that was an important personage to be hearing from and i think the committee did hear from him that this is an issue and it is a problem and it does need to be dealt with so i just wanted to make that point um obviously it probably could be dealt with in administrative rules it maybe could be dealt with in a way that required only electronic medium um and and not paper copies and such so um you know i'm not going to argue strenuously against the um the do not pass but i just wanted to make the point that that i think the lack of people in the room doesn't always suggest the appropriate answer and maybe maybe the committee should have worked a little harder on this bill in its current form it probably doesn't deserve a yes vote but i'm going to give it one anyway further discussion hearing none the question is on the final passage of house bill 1145 secretary please open the key each senator record your vote all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary will close the key the final tally on house bill 1145 reveals nine senators voting ea 37 senators voting nay one senator absent and not voting the bill has lost senator

questions on the motion of senator klein as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the motion carries house bill 1409 will be laid over one legislative day bringing us to the 14th order next matter for consideration of the 14th order house bill 1459 madam secretary engrossed house bill 1459 a bill for an act to provide for a legislative management study of use of a building authority or other methods to finance public building projects as an alternative to political subdivision bonding senator dodson rod mr president and members of the senate house bill 1439 was heard in the senate political subdivisions committee it deals with building authorities and it really uh it started out as a bill on the house side they changed it to a study he came to the senate side and this in the committee is recommending a do not pass on the study this bill came out of the situation in griggs county where they had a courthouse that got built in uh after the voters had said the the when the measure was put on the ballot they had voted it down and the the it appears from our hearing that we had that there was a determination on the part of the county commissioners that they were going to build this courthouse one way or another they had a a grant a 1.2 million dollar grant that they needed to use or else lose if they hadn't had a building authority there is a statutory provision in 57 15 59 that allows them to enter into a lease for a court corrections and law enforcement with just a two-thirds vote of the board in griggs county they they put this measure on the ballot three times and voted down all three times they did they went ahead the county commissioners then to try to get something going set up this building authority uh it allows the issuing of bonds that are uh it's a federal creation it's an i building authorities are created under the guidance of an irs ruling 6320 and that allows them to issue bonds that are exempt from federal income tax we'd heard in the committee from testimony that the building authorities have been an important tool for communities in the state they do control the amount of debt that they incur by linking it to the ability to pay so the authority's debt is linked to a stream a stream of revenue that's used to pay off the debt um the there there are a lot of rules that apply to building authorities they have bylaws articles of incorporation boards of directors i was surprised to find that that building authorities do not have the ability to tax to raise funds they do a count on having a revenue stream probably the best example that we saw in the committee of a building authority that that really works well is in the west fargo school system in 2004 they opened up the cheney middle school and that left a middle school building vacant that building needed some updating and they were looking for good ways to use the space they found entities who wanted to rent the space in west fargo the public library head start ymca day care apple tree preschool and in addition the school district wanted to use some of the space for community high school and early childhood special education and so the school district each of these entities agreed to rent some space in that building the school district then in west fargo created the west fargo schools building authority which then issued lease agreements to all of these tenants and uh the the lease provided backing for the debt that was issued and then they had a flow of revenue coming in through these leases to pay off the bonds and the building authority set aside a portion of the rents to pay off that debt also we should point out that in the 2013 there were some changes regarding building authorities and under today's rules they would have to submit that to the a public vote since we have in statute now a four million dollar limit so we we heard a lot about building authorities and i i don't want to i don't care consider myself an expert on building authorities maybe somewhere in the senate we have an expert that could could get into the real nuances of building authorities but after the hearing the the committee thought that well is it going to be worth the time and effort to get into a study on building authorities when the rules are laid out pretty clearly by the the irs on what you can and can't do we have demonstrated in the past that we as a legislature can put limits on building authorities if we choose to and we did that in 2013 with the four million dollar limit that we have so uh we had a good discussion on building authorities and just decided that this might be one that if someone wants to introduce a bill on building authorities that option is always open to any legislator but that for us to have this considered one of the studies that we wanted to to do we thought we would rather not so the committee voted i think the vote was unanimous in the committee for a do not pass and we'd encourage the senate also to vote no on 1459. further discussion senator lafine mr president i'd like to just add to that carrier did a great job on this bill and i'd just like to remind this group that there is very appropriate places for the use of building authorities there are some schools in north dakota that have used them very successfully and i will remind everybody that when a building authority builds a building uh it it uh does so in a way that the taxpayer is never responsible for the debt and as far as i'm concerned that's even a better way of building buildings than putting uh the taxpayers on the hook for it so i would also encourage us to defeat this bill i think this is really a group looking to put the kibosh on something that's working very very well further discussion hearing none the questions on the final passage of house bill 1459 with the secretary please open the key each senator record your vote all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote

senate amendments a bill for an act to amend and reenact section 20 of the north dakota century code relating to big game and turkey hunting licenses for youth with a life-threatening illness and to provide for a legislative management study senator armstrong mr president the reading of the title of house bill 1081 essentially tells us what the bill does it gives two spring turkey tags for the outdoor adventure foundation now those tags go to qualified youth and essentially what you have to be to be a qualified youth is um have a cancer or other life-threatening disease and so two of the spring turkeys would go to them for the purpose of taking sick kids hunting which is a good idea we also added a study to this bill which essentially is going to have legislative management study whether gamer fish game and fish can develop a system for giving away these charitable tags with some requirements set by the legislature hunting hunting licenses and hunting tags are a big deal for the citizens of north dakota and while all of these groups seem to be very worthy when they come in individually it might be time for the legislature to look at how many of them we give for different species what the requirements are so we don't keep expanding this and expanding this i know a lot of hunters that get a little frustrated that we give away these free tags so we thought the study was a good idea and we also thought given two spring turkey tags for sick kids was a good day good idea passed the committee unanimously and we'd ask this body to do the same any further discussion

will now go to the top of the 14th order house bill 1186 madam secretary engrossed house bill 1186 a bill for an act to create and enact section 12 of the north dakota century code relating to child resistant packaging for liquid nicotine containers to amend and reenact section 12 27 and 51 of the north dakota century code relating to the sale to minors in use by miners of electronic smoking devices or alternative nicotine products to provide a penalty and to provide an expiration date senator grahamer mr president house bill 1186 is the e-cig bill that your committee decided to support a sister bill 1078 that we'll take up shortly as the committee felt did not go far enough in the effort to keep these these from the younger citizens of our state your committee heard a lot of testimony and efforts to amend this legislation but couldn't decide on any changes that would make the bill any better your committee decided rather than try to fix the bill that really was getting these products out of the reach of the young we should support the present bill this bill will put requirements on electronic smoking products and alternative nicotine products it makes it against the law to have them in an open display accessible to the public and defines these products in code one other very important part of this bill is the requirement to have child resistant packaging your committee heard testimony how small quantities of this liquid nicotine can actually be fatal we heard of the passing of a small child out east from just that it also puts in the code the penalty for violating this section finally this bill sets parameters on the sale of these products through the mail or any other telecommunications method your committee voted unanimously to support this bill as presented to us and would ask this body to vote green with us senator oban mr president when it comes to agriculture issues in the senate i i rely on the expertise of our egg producers here uh when it comes to legal issues i sometimes rely on the expertise of our attorneys when it comes to tribal issues i rely on our tribal member when it comes to the excellence of magic town i often turn to my good friend from district five but when it comes to tobacco prevention issues i sort of end up talking to myself and that's okay this bill didn't start as the best bill to address new and emerging tobacco products but it certainly made some improvements especially with regard to youth prevention if you have not seen the editorial in today's largest daily paper it does a pretty decent job outlining what our goal should be as a legislature with regard to products like electronic cigarettes my concerns with this bill are our two issues number one it's the fact that the tobacco industry moves far more quickly and creatively than we do in our ability to meet only every two years for 80 days and the second is that we're using phrases like alternative nicotine products and creating multiple definitions in code for products that are indeed tobacco products and should be treated as such under the law creating multiple definitions makes enforcement and compliance more difficult and protection for minors less effective in addition uh currently we have no idea who's even selling products like electronic cigarettes and unfortunately this bill doesn't help us to address that concern either however sometimes the good outweighs the flaws and that's precisely how i view this bill it's not the best we could do but it's possibly the best we could do right now given the process i would encourage a green vote as somebody who cares deeply about tobacco prevention on house bill 1186 and your understanding that we may need to make some improvements in the future further discussion

madam secretary engrossed house bill 1078 a bill for an act to amend and reenact section 12 27 and 51 of the north dakota century code relating to the sale and use of nicotine devices by minors and to provide a penalty senator grabinger mr president i rise to carry house bill 1078 to this body house bill 1078 is an e-cig bill that had very good intentions the sponsors of this bill intended to keep nicotine devices out of the hands of our young the bill would have simply included nicotine devices in code your judiciary committee heard testimony from several of the young people who this could affect they were supportive of the effort to further restrict the availability of nicotine devices to them one young person even had pictures in her testimony showing displays of these products in a convenience store right on the counter in front of the customers your committee also heard another sister bill which we just passed 1186. that in the opinion of the committee is far more restrictive and deemed by your committee to be a better bill which we just passed i said therefore we mr president your judiciary committee voted unanimously for a do not pass on this bill and would ask this body to put this bill aside with a do not pass as well any further discussion hearing now the questions on the final passage of house bill 1078 with the secretary please open the key each senator record

program senator rest mr president house bill 1395 calls for a legislative management study on the benefits of a statewide emergency information program on the current 911 and emergency services communication systems in our state testimony presented to the senate transportation committee indicated that an emergency information program is a software platform that would enhance what is currently available and in place in the 911 system it would allow for nine one one call takers and first responders to have instant access to additional pertinent information from the caller on such things as disabilities home layout family size allergies and so forth this information program would rely on the residents to input any and all information they desire to have their profile all information submitted stays confidential and only appears when that person makes a call the study also calls for a review of the gaps in the efficiency and services provided by the current system

assessments for irrigation by the garrison diversion conservancy district senator lafeen mr president the garrison uh garrison diversion conservancy district has the ability to special assess farmers for irrigation projects it works very well because they have to have a 100 percent approval of everybody in the district before the project can go forward house bill 1352 is very simple it just takes the sunsets off of that so that the garrison diversion conservancy district can plan farther ahead and be assured that they will be able to continue to use special assessments that's the bill passed

issuance of game and fish licenses and to provide an effective date the fiscal note for the 15 17 biennium indicates expect expenditures and appropriations of a hundred and eleven thousand two hundred and nine dollars senator armstrong mr president house bill 1158 is essentially removing the county auditors from the game and fish licensing a process game and fish licensing is set by the state it's set by the game and fish department however it is left under current lot is left to the county auditors essentially to deal with um the licensing they essentially be under current law they essentially become middlemen in the process they're required to keep the licenses distribute the licenses to businesses hold the money and do those things this bill will take the county auditors out of that out of that mandated and will allow the game and fish to administer licenses directly from the state game and fish has provided information that shows after year one the agency taking over this service they will expect to see a net revenue increase this and this will eliminate the fees game and fish pays to the county auditors which the fees that the game and fish pays to the county auditors is nowhere near enough to cover the county auditor's time and resources the auditors were in favor of this bill and the game and fish was in favor of the bill your committee on natural resources by voter

please say aye any opposed say nay motion carries house bill 1235 will be placed at the bottom of the legislative calendar back to the top of the 14th order house bill 1194 madam secretary engrossed house bill 1194 a bill for an act to create and enact a new chapter to title 21 of the north dakota century code relating to a political subdivision borrowing funds and to amend and reenact sections 11 and 21 of the north dakota century code relating to exemptions from statutory provisions for bonds and the definition of revenues senator anderson mr president i too have been auditioning with the statler brothers and basically what they told me was to come back to the senate where no singing was required and continue to practice my speaking so here i am bringing the six to zero do pass motion to you on house bill 1194. when we consider this bill we did ask some questions of the political subdivisions about if we'd be in trouble with their voters if they borrowed money and then had trouble paying it back and they all promised that they would try not to do that and get us into any trouble the ones who testified on the bill were those who wanted to borrow the money to the political subdivisions and the political subdivisions who wanted to borrow the money we didn't have anybody against the idea but we did discover that the reason that sometimes political subdivisions need to borrow little money for the short term was because a disaster comes or a big snowstorm comes and the township or the county has to pay the bill for snow removal but as you know disaster funds from department of homeland security probably come 18 months later if they come at all and so in the meantime uh somebody's stuck holding the bill and often the county was ending up being the uh person who borrowed the money out to the political subdivision who was smaller and and needed those funds so in the final analysis your political subdivisions committee said this was a good idea limits it to five years and limits it to 500 thousand dollars and we thought that would be fine so we gave it a new pass and hope you will concur thank you further discussion hearing none the questions on the

for an act to amend and reenact subsections seven and nine of section 19 of the north dakota century code relating to marijuana possession offenses and penalties senator armstrong mr president house bill 1394 attempts to simplify um the misdemeanor dispositions of marijuana possession uh nothing has changed as to what constitutes a felony or how a felony is prosecuted however uh with misdemeanor possess with misdemeanor marijuana we uh the a misdemeanor sub-level is kind of removed and anything over an ounce is a felony anything under an ounce is a class b misdemeanor and what you'll find with marijuana cases mr president is that when you go a lot of times these are enforced by local police departments and we had a companion bill too that made paraphernalia a misdemeanor as well which we passed out earlier and the problem becomes is if a city attorney or if a city city law enforcement officer arrests somebody you get these situations where half the case is in district court half the case is in municipal court so you have two different judges and two different prosecutors and if the defendant is injured quite often two different public defenders working on these k on these misdemeanor cases and it's a it's a very un um efficient or non-efficient way to do these processes so what what this bill does is it leaves all the felony the same but anything under announced will revert to a class b misdemeanor and that that way if these cases originate out of city court they can all stay in city court if it originates in district court it can all stay in district court so it's a streamlined approach or it's a efficient way to do it there's still a crime still mandatory addiction evaluation all of those proceedings are the same it just it just takes anything from under an ounce of marijuana makes it a class b misdemeanor it passed the judiciary committee by a voter 6-0 and we'd ask this body to do the same any further discussion hearing none the questions on the

concurrent resolution directing the legislative management to study the airport authorities act with particular attention to airport finances senator dodson rod thank you mr president members of the senate this resolution calls for a study of the north dakota airport authorities act with a particular attention to airport finances the north dakota law was first enacted in 1959 and the sponsor who introduced this measure to us in political subdivisions who also manages an airport was concerned about two things that she pointed out to us one was rapidly increasing capital costs at airports uh all over and the second one the very rapid growth in passengers on flights at regional north dakota airports and so the the resolution is short and to the point it just calls for a study of airports and as a side the measure i reported to the committee that we in the tax committee have heard from the people that work with the century code that the north dakota airport authorities act is not in very good shape uh we've had some airport authority measures in that in the tax area during the session and that's one of the things that was pointed out out to us in the committee is that that that section of the code where that act is has got some uh some parts of it that don't fit together very well and it appears to be old and and uh probably amended in in various at various times in ways that don't really fit together so it seemed to us on the political subdivisions committee that this was probably a worthwhile study and uh so we voted unanimously to endorse this uh measure house concurrent resolution three zero four zero further discussion hearing none will proceed by way of voice vote the question being the adoption final adoption of house concurrent resolution 3040. as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the resolution is adopted house concurrent resolution 3018 madam secretary engrossed house concurrent resolution 3018 a concurrent resolution urging congress to pursue enactment of the regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny act introduced by senator paul in february 2013 requiring congress to approve every major rule proposed by the executive branch which has an annual economic impact of 100 million dollars or more before it can be enforced on the american people senator debra mr president if congress conducted itself the way that the north dakota legislature conducts itself the world would be a better place our founding fathers put in place a system of checks and balances with one branch having those checks and balances on another so in congress in february 2013 was introduced the act referred to as regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny act and it simply says that that any rule adopted by any executive branch agency that would have an impact of more than 100 million dollars would need to be reviewed by congress and approved we have a similar process in north dakota when we have the administrative rule process so that we create law agencies create regulations and those regulations have to go before the administrative rules committee for approval that's a process that works well for north dakota and unfortunately along with the superior legislature that we have in north dakota to the congress we also have executive branch agencies that are more restrictive in the kinds of regulations that they put forward so this this resolution basically encourages congress to be like us and i think that's a good thing further discussion hearing none the questions on the final adoption of house

3046 madam secretary in grossed house concurrent resolution 3046 a concurrent resolution directing the legislative management to study public higher education in north dakota for the purpose of developing and implementing a governance model that articulates the roles and functions of the state board of higher education the commissioner of higher education and the presidents of each institution of higher education under the control of the board senator flacco mr president last fall the voters spoke and they said they are comfortable with the current organizational structure of higher education in north dakota this bill does not deviate from those general precepts rather it is about working within and between those spaces as it is about how the relationship interface with each other our current model of governance of the university system was born out of political turmoil in the 1930s and it has tried to adapt to changes that have been made over decades those changes include such things as campus enrollment numbers changes in the number of campuses online delivery methods and more layers of reporting and governance within the campuses and within the north dakota university system this resolution is an opportunity to make those things better it provides us with a vehicle to ensure a functional model that best serves the interest of all stakeholders this is an import this is an opportune time with a new chancellor and many new board members coming on board this will help establish maintain clarify and protect the relationship and trust within higher education in the state this will help them define and delegate rather react and ratify it will help the board design their own products and processes will help define the links between the board and the ceo of the board and the ceo and the campus presidents the study was set up an environment where the stakeholders can carry out their work within any reasonable interpretation of the board's policy as they execute and implement the board's objectives seems like a timely and important matter mr president and as such your uh would also note that the prime bill sponsors spoke in support of it the chancellor spoke in support of it and no one spoke in opposition you sent an education gave it a 6-0 unanimous do-pass recommendation and we'd ask this body to voice their support further

land that has been unindated by rising waters in devils lake and stump lake senator murphy mr president devils lake has a lot of water in it at present time it's around 1 452 feet at 1458 it would overflow into the cheyenne river system hcr 3020 as for a study of impacts the lake has had on owners of land flooded for some time now if you look at the sponsors of the bill you will see who testified and implored us to allow those affected to be able to tell us their story should the council choose this study they've been paying property tax on what was once their land at a reduced rate hoping that when the lake level decreases to again practice agriculture it is my observation that all peoples learn large lessons slowly if at all although our law now forbids any structures below to be built below 1460 in that basin however they are hoping to once again be able to use their machinery to farm the land or turn out the animals to graze when the lake does go down again we know that the lake was high when we became a state and it goes up and down often and quickly on the scale of geologic time but that is a little comfort for us who measure these events and their impacts in our relatively short lifetime we ask you to join your committee that unanimously agreed to move this forward and in doing so flood the chamber with your ascent further discussion hearing none will proceed

f3Js1cRzRnA,ND,03-13-2013,foreign you you you you [Music] set will come to order we'll be on the first order of business the prayer by our chaplain for the day our chaplain today is reverend cecil stanton and reverend stanton comes to us from the faith center here in bismarck reverend stanton father we thank you for this day which you have made we also thank you for the state of north dakota which you have abundantly blessed and we pray today that you would give wisdom to the senate as they transact legislation that affects not only north dakota but the entire nation we pray that you would continue to bless this nation as you have done in the past i pray also that you would encourage the senators that have taken a stand for what is right and that right would prevail over politics i also pray for protection for those who have been threatened by evil and that good would prevail over the bad just like you did for king david you prepared a banquet table for him in the presence of his enemies and protected him i pray not only for protection but peace to replace turmoil and worry perfect peace that only you can give you are the same today as you were two thousand years ago when you took out the sting of death and won victory over the grave you have given us the same hope of the resurrection just as you rose from the dead on the third day we will also rise after our death and that one day we will hear well done thou good and faithful servant we ask this prayer in jesus name amen amen senate will be on the second order of business the roll call with the secretary please open the key so that all senators can note their presence secretary close the key roll call reveals there are 45 senators present two senators absent and not voting a quorum is declared that the senate will be on the sixth order of business consideration of amendments first matter for consideration under the sixth order today house bill 1422 senator debra mr president house bill 1422 has to do with uh child care as it was introduced it had a little over 15 million dollars in it 13 million of which was to provide direct subsidies to child care providers in oil patch in the amount of twenty seven hundred dollars in outside the oil patch of fifteen hundred dollars and that's per child uh the house didn't like that so they they took that part of it out reduced the dollars to two point one million dollars then they adjusted upward uh the number of people that could be cared for in a group child care and this this uh might be in somebody's home from 18 to 30 and then they made adjustments in the ratio of the number of children that could be cared for by care providers and their employees we didn't like the the adjustment in the ratio because it puts in code what is already dealt with in administrative rule we thought that's the better place to do it so we took that part of it out of the bill they review that periodically and and they have the ability to make the adjustments by administrative rules that they would need to make but then in section one where the house had changed it to 30 children in order to give the department flexibility we changed that to 24. then we what was left in the bill when it came from the house was 2.1 million dollars and and they had that designated for technical assistance and shared services of 1.6 and for data collection and evaluation of 500 000 those dollars were actually used in support of the other 13 million dollars so we took that out but we left the money in and added uh 500 000 so the the bill now has 2.6 million dollars that will be administered by the the department as grants to child care facilities uh in the same manner in which we provided funding two sessions ago to do that so mr chairman that is the those are the amendments we would encourage adoption of the amendments and then the bill goes to the appropriations and they can give appropriate consideration to the amount of the dollar so mr president we would encourage a positive vote on the amendments is there any further discussion hearing on the question is on the adoption of the amendments to house bill 1422 as many as are in favor please say aye all opposed say nay the eyes have it the amendment is adopted 1422 will be re-referred to senate appropriations next matter house bill 1412 senator city mr president under north dakota law if someone under 21 consumes too much alcohol and another person calls for emergency medical responders the person who called for help is immune from criminal prosecution the amendments on house bill 1412 would add immunity for drug overdose as well at the hearing just prior to this hearing the committee heard the heart-rending story of a young man from the northeastern part of the state who when he most needed help was turned out of the house where he had been and was found dead on the lawn in the morning as we heard from the parents many people were at that house but no one called to get this young man help even though he was obviously in distress in its original form in the house this bill contained immunity for drug overdoses but the committee removed that portion of the bill but after reading about similar legislation that passed in another midwest state just about a month ago the sponsor of this bill met with the attorney general and developed this new amendment note subsection one which defines defines overdose as a life-threatening emergency subsection 2 provides immunity to an individual who seeks emergency medical assistance for someone experiencing an overdose if a possession charge would have been acquired as a result of the call subsection 3 provides immunity immunity to the individual experiencing an overdose if the possession charge would have been acquired and subsection 4 is the key it explains that this immunity is limited and may not be extended if law enforcement had suspicion or cause to search for criminal activity and the information was obtained before or independent of the call for emergency assistance and note the last sentence immunity is not provided for delivery or distribution but only for possession in other words only for a very small amount as the attorney gen assistant attorney general summarized at our committee the bill provides immunity for use but not for transactions the assistant attorney general testified that the attorney general is in support of this amendment and helped to draft it drug overdose deaths are the second leading cause of accidental death in the united states and these deaths have increased significantly in recent years a representative of the north dakota student association provided strong support of including drug overdoses in this legislation saying expanded medical amnesty will increase the number of students who seek medical attention for drug and alcohol-related emergencies due to a removal of the fear of punishment at cornell university when a similar policy was implemented there was a 16 percent decrease in people afraid to contact medical help and more than 90 universities around the nation have implemented medical amnesty on their own preventing medical emergencies from becoming criminal prosecutions this legislation would guarantee that good deeds will not be punished and will send a message to young people not to walk away out of fear of reprisal by passage of this amendment the state is saying the first need is the need to save that life as much as all of us detest the drug culture in which so many young people are immersed each of us can also relate to that father and mother whose son was found the next day on the lawn and we all wish someone had been there to make the call for help your committee encourages do pass of this amendment any further discussion hearing none the question is on the proposed amendment to house bill 1412 as many senators are in favor please say aye all opposed saying nay the amendment is adopted switching to the 14th order house bill 1412 now is amended mr secretary house bill number 1412 a bail for an actor created an act a new section to a chapter of the code relating to immunity from criminal liability medical emergencies involving controlled substances and to amend sections of the code relating to immunity from criminal liability in medical emergencies involving drugs or alcohol senator city mr president in addition to what you've already heard 1412 makes three changes to north dakota's alcohol immunity law section 1 extends immunity to those under age 21 who call for emergency medical services if they remain on the scene until assistance arrives the change also eliminates the provision that a maximum of five people may be immune for any one occurrence section two extends immunity to those age 21 and over if they remain on the scene again that's an addition until the emergency medical responders arrive under current law the immunity has been only for those under age 21. and section 3 extends immunity to those who contributed to the delinquency of the minors if emergency medical services were called and again if the individual stays on the scene until assistance arrives and cooperates with the emergency medical responders we all know that it is of the utmost importance that the emergency medical responders know what was consumed and how much again the attorney general favors this bill it is not about being soft on crime it is about saving lives deaths from alcohol poisoning and drug overdose are tragic usually because those who die are so very young and this bill says first save the life your committee recommends passage by a vote of four to three further discussion senator anderson mr president i'm going to ask you to support this legislation uh you as you all know we're in the drug business and enforcing drug laws but i feel it would be a shame if some young person dies because the people with him were afraid to report that he needed help right away we've had this legislation in place for alcohol it's worked well and i think it will work well for the drug overdoses thank you any further discussion hearing now the question is on the final passage of house bill 1412 is amended secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house bill 14-12 reveals 42 senators voting yea three senators voting nay the bill is passed house bill 10 back to the sixth order house bill 1025 senator hogue mr president house bill 1025 relates to compensation to private property owners when land is commandeered during a declared emergency commandeering is a little different from taking property we all know under our democratic rule of law that when the government takes uh private property for public use that the government must must compensate the private land owner commandeering is a little different mr president and and there are exceptions to the general rule that that that government must compensate uh private land owners um for example mr president during times of war if if the uh if your property is damaged by an act of war or by a declared emergency our common law has held that the the private property owner isn't entitled to uh compensation as a matter of law however there are exceptions to the exceptions and our our government has always seen fit to compensate individuals whose land was damaged during times of war and our state government and our municipal governments have also seen fit to compensate private landowners when land is or property is commandeered during a declared emergency and that's what house bill 1025 relates to it set out initially in the house to to require all political subdivisions to pay for uh private property owners when land is commandeered typically during a a flood or other emergency the bill came over to the uh senate and it was heard by senate judiciary and we put on some amendments that didn't that basically retain the common law which is to say that government will not always be compelled to compensate private landowners when their land is commandeered and we did that you can see mr president on page page one line seven we change that from must to may and we did that after hearing a couple of uh a couple of hearings uh through multiple uh city attorneys and other municipal and political subdivision leaders and basically we decided that that was the best approach um for a number of reasons uh number one is it is it does preserve what the common law is but number two uh is that the cities that are experiencing recurring emergencies like flooding are doing an outstanding job of redressing government takings during these during these emergencies for example the city of fargo has set up a special fund to compensate individuals whose backyards are damaged when they have to put dikes in their backyards during flood preparations and so that's what that's the crux of the amendment mr president is to uh to preserve the common law and to say that uh political subdivisions uh are not going to always be obligated to make reparations during an emergency the balance of the amendments relate to the fact that if you assert a claim against the state of north dakota there's a different procedure than if you're asserting a claim against political subdivisions and we clarified that in the balance of the amendment your judiciary committee thought the the amended version as a sound version and we asked for the full sentence concurrence any further discussion hearing none the question is on the proposed amendment to house bill 1025 as many senators are in favor please say aye all opposed say nay the amendment is adopted to the 14th order house bill 1025 now is amended mr secretary house bill number 1025 a bail for enactment and reenacted sections of the code relating to liability and immunity during disaster response and financing of repairs senator hogue well mr president i think i i explained the the purpose of the bill the amendments weren't a hog house amendment but they were fairly close what we have in front of us now is uh house bill 1025 that says that a political subdivisions if they commandeer private property they they are not legally obligated to uh to reimburse uh private landowners in the event of emergency but our our knowledge is that they always have and in this bill we give them some extra tools to do that we give them the ability to set up a special assessment commission to to assess uh special assessments even if the even if the property is merely putting putting dirt in place and removing dirt we give them that ability to to to defer the costs of a commandeering operation during a declared emergency and mr president we think this is a reasonable compromise and it it protects the interests of the property owners and protects the interests of the municipalities and so we urge its adoption further discussion senator cook mr chairman i got a question for the carrier and the question is uh if the city wants to put a dyke in my backyard to protect my house from flooding and i say yes please do i don't get compensation i assume but if the city wants to put a dyke in my backyard to protect my house and i say no you can't and they do anyway does that then allow me to get compensation are we creating a motive where one would probably say no senator ho do you wish to answer the question mr president i don't think so as i mentioned the cities that are are experiencing uh recurring flood threats they're setting up programs today where the typical the typical expense is the landscaping in the backyard where the dike has to come through your backyard and there's going to be costs associated with re-landscaping your backyard repairing maybe some outdoor sheds and so they they're they're setting up funds and i think the senators from district 34 i think even his uh uh his city as well is is uh is looking into that although they they're on the missouri river they haven't had that recurring flood threat that the city of fargo has had so i think the i think the the strategy of the cities is to develop standard agreements regardless of whether the the landowner consents or not consents if they have to come through and commandeer your backyard you're going to get compensated whether whether you consent or not further discussion hearing none the question is on the final passage of house bill 1025 is amended with the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house bill 1025 reveals 45 senators voting yea two senators absent and not voting the bill is passed back to the sixth order house bill 1451. senator city mr president house bill 1451 deals with the duties of grand juries which are guaranteed in the fifth amendment of the bill of rights and article 1 section 10 of the north dakota constitution a grand jury operates under very different procedures than most of us are familiar with in the regular jury process these are closed proceedings the accused person does not have a right to have an attorney present any evidence that is obtained in violation of the fourth amendment in other words without a search warrant or the fifth amendment um which is forgotten which is with something with trials and the sixth amendment which is the speedy and public trial may be used against the person in most cases grand juries have been replaced with preliminary hearings where the accused has a right to defense counsel so now that you have that background information let's take a look at the amendments in the new section one sponsors and circulators of petitions that call for grand juries would face the same disclosure requirements as are in place for initiated measures and referendums in subsection one it says the petition sponsors would be required to disclose contributions received and expenditures made in excess of one hundred dollars in subsection two it includes those who circulate the petitions or promote its passage would be subject to the same financial disclosure requirements in subsection three any out of state contributions in excess of one hundred dollars must also be disclosed in the available the committee must disclose whether the circulators have been or will be paid and the total amount of money paid or expected to be paid there is another amendment also in section 2 subsection 3 which is found on page 3 line 29 under current law if 10 percent of the electors of the total vote cast in the county for governor in the last election sign a petition a grand jury must be convened in some counties as few as 43 people could sign and then convene a grand jury the house increased that percent of signatures required to 40 percent of the electors in the last gubernatorial election but the judiciary the committee thought that number was too high and so we decreased it to 25 percent but there is a minimum number of signers of 225 and a maximum of 5 000 per county the amendments passed five to two and your judiciary committee urges your approval further discussion hearing none the question is on the proposed amendment to house bill 1451 as many senators are in favor please say aye all opposed say nay the amendment is adopted switching to the 14th order house bill 1451 now is amended mr secretary house bill number 1451 a bill for an act to amend and reenact a section of the code relating to disclosure requirements for petition sponsors and the requirements for calling and the duties of a grand jury senator city mr president the only portions of the bill we haven't yet discussed are in our sections three and four on page four in section three the grand jury is to inquire into the offenses against against offenses in the criminal code that have been committed in that county the offenses may be brought by the court or the state's attorney or his or her designee the state's attorney informs the grand jury of the alleged offense the identity of the offender and the other and the state's recommended action in section 4 the word felonious is added so that a grand jury may inquire into willful and corrupt felonious misconduct in office not be convened for minor charges the sponsors of the bill made the point that a grand jury should be impaneled only when there's broad support from within the county and when there is something of substance to be investigated a grand jury serves as a check on the prosecutor if he fails to act and then the citizens have a recourse but there are other recourses also any individual may bring a case that could go to trial the prosecutor could be recalled there are elections to deal with prosecutors who fail to act while the grand jury process is important and is part of the constitution it needs to be used only in serious cases when proper authorities fail to act and the judiciary committee recommends do pass by a vote of four to three senator schneider uh mr president just for clarification all the protections in the bill of rights are going to adhere if someone becomes a criminal defendant uh just to be absolutely straightforward on that second i have two questions for the carrier mr president the first if i heard the carrier correctly uh that there's a minimum requirement of 225 signatures i'm wondering if the committee gave any consideration to the fact that this could potentially preclude the grand area grand jury statute from being used in some of our smaller population counties i guess that's the first question and i could yield for an answer now center city do you wish to answer that question yes mr president there are always in every county there at least the least number of votes cast was 430 and so 225 would be quite quite a large number but yet we felt that it is a very achievable number senator schneider mr president i would just uh hope for good voter turnout to continue in that case uh the second question with the carrier mr president how many times has an individual been indicted uh by a citizen initiated grand jury in the history of our state center city do you wish to answer that question mr president i don't know any further discussion senator nelson well mr president uh the minority leader just asked one of my questions but one of the concerns i had in one of the reasons i voted no on this in committee was 43 people based on a county size of 4 430 225 is more than half of the county that would have to sign that petition whereas if you lived in my county with a hundred thousand people you're maxed out at five thousand people signing i don't think that's fair this was i think brought to light because of the situation of county west of us uh we had several people in and it almost sounded like we were debating that particular discussion but it really is broader than that we have to look at beyond one suit that's brought we have to look at the whole thing and i just didn't think this this bill was necessary further discussion hearing now the question is on the final passage of house bill ford i'm sorry senator sinner i have a question of the judiciary committee maybe the chairman we're talking about a bill here changes our constitution changes our laws and there wasn't any there wasn't any testimony regarding how many times this has been used in the past none is that correct is there any senator wish to answer the question either the chairman or the carrier mr president we heard that there are six um petitions being circulated currently in the state but we don't know if anyone has actually been indicted in the past that was the first question senator hogue mr president uh this does not amend the constitution further discussion hearing none the question is on the final passage of house bill 1451 the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house bill 1451 reveals 30 senators voting yea 15 senators voting nay two senators absent and not voting the bill is passed back at the sixth order house concurrent resolution 3011. senator hogue mr president we do have a bill here that proposes to amend our constitution house concurrent resolution 3011 relates and affects the initiated measure process and the bill started out in the house mr president with several restrictions uh that the house stripped away one of them would have forbade the paying of of circulators to circulate petitions another provision that was stripped out of this bill would have required that the petitions be gathered in at least the sufficient number of signatures be gathered in at least 50 percent of the counties in north dakota but the one measure uh the one part of this bill that did survive is a requirement that any initiated measure that proposed to spend 20 million dollars or more would have to go on the november general election ballot and that's the way it came over to uh your senate judiciary committee the committee looked at it and and did a couple of amendments one of them was that they changed the 20 million dollars to 40 million dollars and they added a an inflator recognizing that this was going into the constitution and we didn't think it good policy to have a flat dollar amount we changed 20 to 40 million dollars and made it adjust with inflation the the second change mr president that was proposed or is proposed by your judiciary committee relates to a number of bills that we have seen relating to the qualifications of circulators and what we did in the in the last part of the amendments is to make clear that the legislative assembly may define the qualifications of anybody in the state that wishes to circulate petitions mr president you may recall that we we passed a bill in in the senate that would have required that they be residents for two years what this amendment does is just say at some future time if this is adopted the legislature may prescribe what the qualifications of the electors are your judiciary committee recommends adoption of these amendments mr president any further discussion hearing none the question is on the proposed amendment to house concurrent resolution 3011. as many senators are in favor please say aye all opposed say nay the eyes have it the resolution or the amendment is adopted rather down to the 14th order house concurrent resolution 3011 now as amended mr secretary house concurrent resolution number 3011 a concurrent resolution to amend and reenact section 2 and 3 of article 3 of the constitution of north dakota relating to the circulation of petitions and the fiscal impact of initiated measures senator hogue well mr president as the bill now stands uh if if this senate was to pass it and if the people of north dakota were to adopt it any time a future initiated measure wanted to spend 40 million dollars of inflation-adjusted dollars of state's money they would have to put that matter on the general election rather than the primary election and likewise if the if a future legislative assembly decided to define the qualifications of petition circulators they would be explicitly authorized by this measure again mr president your judiciary committee recommends that we adopt this resolution senator schneider mr president just a brief question for the carrier to make sure i'm following things the amendment in section two which would amend the constitution to allow for the legislative assembly to set the requirements for petition circulators with regard to the bill that we previously considered in this body that sets some requirements for petition circulators are we getting ahead of ourselves here do we not have the constitutional authority to pass out the bill that we already passed out senator hoge do you wish to answer that question uh yes mr president well there's another constitutional provision that creates an inherent conflict and basically what it says mr president it recognized when we adopted the initiated and referral process we recognized that there would be a tension between the legislative branch of government and the people's prerogative to pass laws or refer laws through the initiated measure process and so there's a provision in the constitution that says that the legislature may not unduly restrict or impair the right of the people to pass initiated measures and i think uh in answer to my friend from district 42 that's why a lot of these other provisions were voted down both in the house and the senate you know requiring that of that the signatures be gathered from 50 of the counties or restricting the ability to pay circulators i think that was the rationale be behind uh those measures going down in defeat but this last uh last provision that the the senator from district 42 mentioned is just to make clear that in some future point if the legislature wants to describe and define what the qualifications of a circulator are they may do so further discussion hearing none the question is on the final passage of house concurrent resolution 30 11. we'll proceed by way of recorded roll call vote is that this is a constitutional matter again the question being the final passage final adoption of house concurrent resolution 3011 with the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house concurrent resolution 30-11 shows 25 senators voting yeah 20 senators voting nay two senators absent and not voting the resolution is adopted 14th order house bill 1278 mr secretary house bill number 1278 has a fiscal notable for an act to create an accurate chapter of the code relating to north dakota outdoor heritage fund and to amend sections of the code reading to oil and gas gross production tax to provide appropriation and provide for continuing appropriation a fiscal note section two of this bill allocates a portion of the oil and gas gross production tax to the north dakota outdoor heritage fund the amount allocated to this fund is 4 of the first 1 of oil and gas gross production tax limited to 15 million in the fiscal year and 30 million in the biennium senator hogue well mr president as the secretary described this house bill 1278 would create a new fund the fund would be called the north dakota outdoor heritage fund and the purpose of the fund is as described on the on the bottom of page one and top at page two of the bill it essentially is to enhance the outdoor recreational activities like hunting and fishing and to improve air and water quality and other environmental concerns now the bill as the secretary also described contains a funding mechanism and a continuing appropriation and if you're familiar with our our oil extraction and gross production tax you know that we impose a five percent gross production tax and that five percent is imposed on the value of oil and uh oil that comes out of the wellhead and we have a statute that sets aside one percent of that five percent for certain purposes and basically what uh what this bill would do is take and i apologize for all the percentages but if you do the math you you can you can determine the amount it's four percent of the one percent of the five percent of the gross production tax and that's uh that's the amount of money capped at the 30 million that's available to this fund now most of the uh bill mr president is a is a address to the governance structure of this fund and basically what it would be if the the decisions would all be made by the north dakota industrial commission and the industrial commission is comprised of the governor the attorney general and our ag commissioner they would make decisions on how the money is spent out of this fund however uh those those three members of the industrial commission would be advised by an advisory committee and that committee consists of of of 12 members and the 12 members are stakeholders in in in outdoor heritage i guess is the best way to describe them there would be several members from the ag community several members from the conservation groups and specifically naming ducks unlimited pheasants forever among others there would be a couple members from the oil and gas industry and these uh 12 members would form an advisory body and they would advise the uh industrial commission on the best way to use this money the the bill also contains restrictions on how the industrial commission could spend this money and you see that and in pages two and three the commission could not use it to uh to acquire land they could not use it for lobbying activities or litigation activities essentially what it would be would be to to buy up conservation easements and those easements could not exceed 20 years so that's the essence of the bill mr president your uh your senate natural resources recommends a do pass of this bill we heard lots of different amendments on the bill and i have a feeling we're going to hear more mr president but we ultimately rejected all the amendments and recommend that the bill be passed as is senator axnes well thank you mr president and thanks for the carrier for doing a good job explaining the bill ladies and gentlemen uh i'm standing here today a little torn on uh house bill 1278. you know i strongly support the idea of preserving our landscape but in this current form i don't know if i can support this bill as you'll recall i introduced senate concurrent resolution 4027 out of the pure passion many of us have for the north dakota outdoors that we grew up in and that was voted down rather quickly two legislative days after the the introduction and even though i was disappointed with that outcome especially after seeing an estimated over 80 hunters and fishermen and women dressed in camouflage and blaze orange i'm glad that we've at least taken this discussion to a heightened level because it's an important discussion to have you know what are we going to do if anything to preserve the vast outdoors we've grown up in and the landscape that we inherited you know i grew up in rural north dakota and it's a story that many of us share in this chamber you know we began hunting at a very early age walking sloughs and shelter bells before we could legally carry a gun during the summers i would walk the buttes of benson county looking for deersheds and other things right along highway 30. and in fact during crossover this session instead of jumping on a plane and flying south to avoid the cold as i've heard some of us have done i actually went to the country in north dakota the taking the serenity and the peace of it all you know and i went there to focus and humbly embrace the landscape our grandparents have taken care of and left behind for us to inherit and our outdoor experience is partly why i've chosen to keep north dakota as my home and it's something that i hope my kids can experience when that time comes and some of you have noticed that some of our members have pins on and it's a picture of former governor art link and it's a it's a daily reminder of the task before us that we should never lose sight of what has made north dakota legendary and now perhaps more than any other time we are faced with the task of balancing our rapid progress and our previous heritage and governor link's words are as true now as they were then and it's that we don't want to halt progress but we need to make sure that we let those who follow and repopulate the land be able to say that the land is as good and in some cases better than before because when the landscape is quiet again and the last drop of oil is extracted will we be proud and willing to take our grandchildren to show them the legendary north dakota or will it be something of the past only to be found in pictures of our photo albums and our state history books and though we're blessed to have this development occurring in our state and the opportunities it's created we need to be bold in the face of this rapid change another reason i introduced a concurrent resolution 4027 is because of this bill has two components i feel are misguided first is the funding level capped at 30 million in biennium personally i don't feel that this this level of funding is adequately going to address the depleting habitat and quality water and i fear that if we place too little money into this effort now it will be too late when we finally realize that our opportunity has passed and the landscape and wildlife we cherish or diminish and the second shortfall and the one that had me greatly concerned since i first reviewed this bill is the governance 1278 would place the conservation efforts of this state our outdoor heritage under the control of the industrial commission and the industrial commission is the same governing body who reviewed an application to drill next to a historical and culturally culturally sensitive site in the kildier mountains after review they decided to move forward and that decision was misguided to say the least in my opinion further actions the commission has allowed development to creep next to a little missouri state park these are areas that we cherish and this commission is allowing this rapid development to consume some of it and this is the same governing body that will now be riddled with conflict in whether to preserve our landscape or permit the rapid development to move forward unbalanced history shows that consistently it's leaned towards the rapid development and industry so my question is when the same body is inclined to advancing industry with little to no limitations or checks i can't con uh and trust in them the task of conserving our landscape and because of that concern i will ask mr president can we be on the 8th order for the purpose of an amendment without objection the senate will be on the eighth order senator axnes ladies and gentlemen each of you should have a copy of the proposed amendment and mr president i move amendment number 13.0432.04008 are there any senators who do not have a copy of the amendment just referenced by senator axeman senator axeman ladies and gentlemen the the amendment to house bill 1278 would change the governance of this outdoor heritage fund fund from the industrial commission to the board of university and school lands and the land board is not a new governing body and it is made up of the governor the secretary of state the attorney general the department of instruction and the state treasurer and what that means is these are all elected officials who are going to be accountable to the people of the state and that is something that the people lobbying for the passage of this bill in his current form has stated as their uh main reasoning to sticking with the industrial commission is that they're all elected officials and they're accountable the difference is the land board actually deals with and is knowledgeable about our land they deal with it for decades upon decades with this exact thing and its distance from the influence applied to the industrial commission and it seems to me that this is a much more desirable governance and uh for true and honest conservation efforts so members of the senate uh urge the adoption of the amendment to show that the people the state that we are serious about and about preserving our state's legacy and our landscape and mr president i would request a recorded roll call vote on the amendment would eight senators please stand if you were in support of senator access's request very well the senate will proceed by way of recorded roll call vote further discussion on the amendment proposed by senator axnes senator miller mr president i just wasn't going to comment on this bill or the amendment but i rise in opposition to both but i'll tell you why i'm posing this amendment i think there's some kind of problem out there that somehow the agriculture community is against conservation now so far from the truth it's funny almost but the agriculture commissioner and the agriculture commission that department and and farmers in general spent a good portion of their day and their time working on conservation manners because of what farming does today there's more wildlife and and the waters are cleaner than they were before we have no-till operations and and conservation tillage operations we have shelter belts we have a myriad of of things that we do as farmers to try and conserve the top soil and preserve the land because that's where we make our money and removing the agriculture commissioner from this oversight of this board is quite frankly a little bit of a slap in the face towards agriculture the agriculture commissioner is involved daily on matters of conservation they control our chemicals that we put on our crops they make sure that our fertilizers are properly used and and stored they do all kinds of things to help better our environment and that's why i pose these amendments and that's why i post the bill because we do so much already and we're doing more every day and i think this is just unnecessary hogue well mr president i wanted to thank the senator from district 16 for bringing this amendment forward i think it's a genuine effort to make the the bill and the and the fund better but i have to oppose the amendment as well we did talk about this uh down in committee mr president and for the senate's uh benefit the the state land board uh consists of the governor the attorney general the superintendent of public instruction the state treasurer and the secretary of state so that's your land board and where the bill is now is in the industrial commission which also consists of the governor and the attorney general and uh notice mr president how we keep the lawyers on all the boards and commissions and that's that's not a bad thing but also the the ag commissioner and i have to agree with uh with my friend from district 10 the major stakeholder in this bill and in this legislation is the ag community and if we were to adopt the amendment from the senator from 16 from from district 16 what we'd be doing is we'd be putting the state treasurer and the superintendent of public instruction and the secretary of state on and removing the ag commissioner and i just i just think that's the wrong approach because the ag community is a major stakeholder in this legislation and they need to be a decision maker with respect to how these funds are spent so i would urge the senate to reject the amendments senator triplett mr president i'm i'm in favor of the amendments but i don't disagree with either of the previous speakers that the the agriculture commissioner is is an important factor in in lots of processes relating both to production agriculture and to conservation but my reason for favoring putting this fund into the state land board as opposed to the industrial commission is really not so much about who the members are that serve on each board as we've discussed there is a fair amount of overlap but but rather just understanding a little bit about how things really happen in the real world the state land board and the state industrial commission in those capacities as boards those people only meet for a few hours each month and most of what they do they rely on recommendations from staff and the state land board has as the proponent of the amendment has already described has been in existence since statehood managing all of our state lands and so they have on staff many people biologists and such who who understand grazing and agriculture and conservation issues because they've been managing all of the state trust lands and other state lands to the extent they don't include buildings on them i think but all of the lands out there that are are in in grazing or agriculture since statehood and so when when these bodies meet when the land board meets as a board to discuss what to do with state lands they rely heavily on the recommendation of their staff when the industrial commission meets as the industrial commission to consider issues relating to the housing finance agency or the bank of north dakota or the oil and gas division they also rely in very large measure on recommendations from staff the industrial commission i believe meets regularly for about one half day per month and yet they are responsible for all of those very significant areas of economic development in north dakota and simply as a matter of of need they give enormous amounts of responsibility to their staff to bring forward recommendations and so if we leave this with the industrial commission one of two things would happen either it would just become a rubber stamp on the advisory committee or the industrial commission would have to add other staff who would be would have expertise in the areas now of conservation and land management and so i think it just makes sense to put this in inside the board where the staff is already present and already has decades of experience in managing our state lands so it has really nothing to do with keeping the agriculture commissioner off it so much as having having staff people available to to deal with it senator bowman mr president i just wanted to clear one thing that was said about the changing landscape of north dakota yes it's changing but it seems to me like everyone in this body is willing to accept that change when it comes to appropriation but here's the catch i can take people out to western north dakota and we'll sit in a bus and i'll show you where oil sites have been reclaimed and i would be willing to wager you'll never be able to find it we've done that before people are overwhelmed if it gets to be a problem we can correct that problem with proper reclamation laws so that the next two or three generations from now we will have it back to the way it originally was and i've seen it myself so i know it can be done senator unruh mr president um i would just like to stand to say uh that i think we should reject these amendments today and i appreciate and actually share the same concerns as the senator from district 18. technical expertise is necessary in allocating these funds it's very important to know exactly what's how the programs will be implemented and what they will be doing but i believe that that is addressed with the advisory board and the non-voting members that shall be appointed to this advisory board and you can find that on page three in subsection two there will be a member of parks wreck game and fish from the state forestry and then also from the soil conservation district so i believe that technical expertise is provided in the advisory board further discussion hearing none the question is on the proposed amendment to house bill 1278 proceed by way of recorded roll call vote the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on the proposed amendment is 13 senators voting yeah 32 senators voting nay two senators absent and not voting the amendment fails continuing on the 14th order 14th order still on house bill 1278. any further discussion senator erbley well mr president i rise to oppose the bill but i am for conservation and number of years back i switched from being a cattleman to a to a grass manager because i discovered that when i got away looking at at the production of the animal and started looking at the production of the land that became a whole lot more successful i've used a lot of conservation programs just this past fall my family and i received the district soil conservation award a few years back i was named range manager of the year so i i've lived i breathe conservation um it's good for the land especially where i live in uh in a very fragile environment in the katoa i actually stood in this chamber a couple sessions ago as a co-sponsor of a bill that would have allowed perpetual easements for for all rangeland for anyone who wanted to enter those contracts and i would still stand by that because i feel that we shouldn't be destroying any of those properties anymore but i'm against this bill not because i'm against conservation but because of the reason that it's here and it's here because it's a reactionary bill the initiated measure that failed last fall is why it's here we're trying to get out ahead of something that some of us not us that well some have gotten afraid of and you know you look at the folks that ran that initiated major they didn't get enough you know people to really run the signatures they hired people to do that and then it became fraudulent um so we come up with this bill and now we're well into the session and they are a part of the team they're a part of the group that wants this bill to go forward and yet midway through they bail on it so that tells me that that no matter what we do here they're not going to be appeased by it and so like i said i'm against it because of the reason that it's here not for what it does another reason i'm guessed it is as we look at the oil tax and oil production we've all seen the graphs on how the oil wells operate our production is really really high in the first year to 18 months and it almost looks like a capital letter l at start time it it comes to the bottom and then levels off and so right now we're operating in that flush part of the drilling where we're seeing the high production and that will continue a few years but that's going to level out and we need to use the cream of the crop so to speak to deal with the impacts in the oil areas and throughout the state for infrastructure so that when it levels off we we then have a solid base to operate from i sit on the appropriations i in the subcommittee on the human services budget dealing with talking about a dollar wage increase for nursing home people a dollar an hour basic care dds that a dime equals a million dollars we start pulling money away from that we're affecting our grandparents i want nine hundred thousand dollars for my senior meals for the congregate meals we want to do property tax relief we're pulling dollars away from that so i'm willing to let this thing be defeated if an initiated measure comes around i do feel that the people of this state of north dakota are smart enough to see that that these dollars if not won't be available for the very goods and services that they need and really uh one other point i'd like to make just a couple weeks ago our junior senator from washington dc was here and in her speech to us she made a comment she's talking about the farm bill and the necessity of doing that and her quote from that was that we want to make sure or see that conservation won't run over our farmers in the last farm bill it was really known as a conservation bill and now in this farm bill she is saying we want to make sure the conservation won't run over our farmers well if we pass this bill we're not going to run over the farmers but we will run over our grandparents we will run over our children and i would just encourage a no vote on this thank you senator anders mr president and members of the senate as you all know i love the west uh and i want to share with you how some of the folks out there feel i feel quite threatened by by this bill and most of them i think out there felt threatened by the other failed uh opportunity and they're struggling they're trying to figure out they're in the air part or the dry part of our state and they've worked so hard on conservation they used to give awards every year to the best conservation farmers they've developed conservation farming activities the u.s fish and wildlife agency has been almost ruthless in buying up uh water uh easements and they wonder why everybody wants to fix their land because they think they've been really good stewards when we have visitors come west like is not one of their first comments is there's no trees out here and i tell them that's because god didn't plant very many of them go out and see how many of the farmers have planted and it'll seem like a whole lot more to you we do care about our land we do love to have visitors come out to our land but we don't like to have people from afar telling us what we can do with our land i'm really torn between this bill and i'm still not sure how i'm going to vote i know i don't like it but i'm wondering if it's worth paying the ransom so we can buy off the wildlife interests that want to control our land i just want you to know that our farmers and ranchers feel they've been good stewards and that they feel this kind of thing is a slap in their face senator wanzik well mr president uh i honestly can say i'm sitting here right now i'm not even sure i'm going to vote on this yet it's i've got real mixed feelings about it i want to let my urban friends know that i care about conservation care about wildlife and i'd like to exhibit that somehow on the other hand in line with the previous comments and the center from section or legislative district 10 i feel sometimes people don't quite understand how things have changed on the farm we heard from the senator uh from district 33 and how the landscape has changed and how there's reclamation of uh former drilling sites i spent the last 40 years participating on a working farm and ranch milk cows did it all and i look at how things have changed from my personal perspective we used to moldboard plow everything everything was worked black to the point that we had snort storms in the in the spring and then we'd summer follow a third idle a third of it and we'd get heavy rains and a lot of soil would erode but through good programs like the soil conservation service and through the concern and actions of farmers we've dramatically changed that my brother and i farm over ten thousand acres with my dad and my son and my nephew and every single acre right now is has cover from previous year's crop there's food there's shelter you don't see the dirt blowing in the spring anymore like you used to you don't see the water eroding the soil like you used to we just don't seem to get enough credit for it sometimes and i think it's important that people hear that and it's i see it happening not just in our farm but all around us the technology has helped us in that sense as well you know i i understand the concern for our land and our resources and you know the public interest in that but remember besides the public interest from my point of view there's a personal emotional attachment for me why would i want to do anything to hurt that land i'm a fourth generation my great grandfather came from poland grandma and grandfather didn't even speak english my great uh my grandfather and a number of his sons started their own farms there as well there's a connection there beyond what anybody else could understand for me even my wife doesn't completely understand it when i drive by the trees or the water dugout or the waterways grass buffer strips that have been seeded over the years in the trees i remember hand picking the weeds out of the trees that we planted there's a lot of hard back breaking work but anyway i'm still not certain how i'm going to vote on this i know that's not helpful but i want to make sure that all of you understand the lion's share there's always a bad apple out there i know there is that's that's in any walk of life but us farmers and ranchers care more about that land than anybody could ever imagine and we have a true interest in making sure that it's well taken care of and we conserve our resources i want the fifth generation the sixth generation of onesies to have the same opportunity that i had thank you senator center mr president members of the body i grew up in a farm family spent all my early years working hard on the farm and i can tell you that my family's farm goes back to the turn of the century same family working the land i care deeply about the land and i know my friend a senator from district 29 wouldn't do anything ever to harm his land and i know that all the rest of you feel the same way but i can tell you this about my friends that live in the community that i live in i heard time and time again how hard it is to find a place to hunt and how much we have to pay to hunt in the fall of 2011 made six trips west of the missouri river to hunt every time i did that i had to pay money that's what really this bill is about is public access to land just getting opportunity so that people who have that heritage that love to hunt and care about the land can have access and that's why i encourage you to support this bill thank you senator unruh mr president i stand in support of this bill today i believe that it has many facets to it and it can meet many different needs that we have here in our state um to preserve our heritage and preserve our lands for our future generation as the mom of two small children and my family roots and farming and ranching i know that it's very important that we preserve our land for our future generations and i believe that this is a step in the right direction to achieve that goal i'm also a supervisor on our local soil conservation district board and i believe that this bill will allow those successful programs that have been mentioned here on the floor today to continue to thrive and to continue to be utilized by those farmers and ranchers who are already taking care of the land i believe that this will be an extra tool for them to be able to do so and i think that those state agencies who have been implementing those programs and creating those programs can continue to do so can create new programs to allow more opportunities for true conservation on the ground in cooperation with our farmers and ranchers i believe that's the most important part of this bill and that it can serve many different many different needs from many different groups whether it be hunting groups or or farmers or ranchers or conservation that's why the advisory board is set up the way that it is there are there's representation from all walks of life and i think that with that representation on this board with this amount of funding that all of the goals that we have talked about here today can be achieved through this program so i encourage this body to support this bill today for the discussion senator erbley mr president i just want to say one other thing as to the previous speaker mentioning our very fine state agencies of of the soil conservation districts the the game and fish and the parks and rec those agencies all have budgets that come before us and i really would encourage them to bring those requests to us here and and we can sure fund them on a case-by-case basis they already have projects and programs in place um i've used any number of those as well and and we could surely just work with that within the system we currently have they just bring the request to the budget for their budget when they come and see us further discussion hearing none the question is on the final passage of house bill 1278 secretary

may briefly pause the president wishes to announce we got a special guest with us here today former senator ben tollefson if your former colleague would step to the to the uh rail senator tollefson be recognized by your colleagues welcome senator klein mr president uh house bill 1274 deals with electronic prior authorization and almost two years ago to the day we passed house bill 1422 and in that legislation uh looks almost identical to what we're looking at today since then north dakota has received national recognition for renewing the discussion and work to incorporate electronic prior authorization within our electronic prescribing system as providers and pharmacies have moved to electronic prescribing and electronic prior authorization has remained a burdensome paper process requiring providers to fill out forms fax them to payers for review often resulting in delays for patient access to treatment and medication uh during the 1113 interim the health information technology advisory committee studied electronic prior authorization to align north dakota with those national standards being developed and received updates from a national pharmacy service sector organization that indicated the development and implementation of the electronic prior authorization standards but that was going to happen in the next 18 to 24 months so mr president uh the result of that was house bill 1274 which amends the effective date to august 1st 2015 to accommodate this time frame and the other change in it mr president is that worker safety insurance has been exempted from that uh wsi does not currently nor will it likely ever have the capability of providing electronic medication prior authorization services for the uh in uh in lieu of this contemplated statute so

house bill 1464 comes from the finance and tax committee and it just simply allows for an increase in compensation allowance that businesses are granted by the state for the collection of state sales tax from the current amount of 93.75 that's not million or a thousand and to raise it to only 110 a month compensation was increased last session by eight dollars this was the only increase in 20 years while sales tax collections have increased from 717 million in all three to two and a half billion in o13 if prorated fractionally it should be about 350 but they're only requesting 110. for the most part this is the cost of doing business and collecting state taxes and we support this small increase our committee passed it unanimously and i encourage this body to concur further discussion

neurological conditions for the north dakota veterans and their families senator denver mr president lieutenant colonel stood at our podium in our committee room yesterday and talked about the difference between her generation and my generation i didn't think i was that much older than she is but there is a big difference between the way that we treat our veterans now and that the way that we used to treat our veterans one of those differences is that we recognize post-traumatic stress syndrome or ptsd i guess post-traumatic stress disorder and our attempts to treat it with different methods and this bill was introduced with 1.49 million dollars in it to provide services and for outreach services that are non-traditional in nature as as you heard the secretary read in the title so the the house appropriations took the money out of it and said we ought to study it we uh we heard it in human services yesterday and and uh you know we would very much like to see um services expanded for for those areas i think we have an obligation to our veterans who come back from the war to welcome them but to also recognize the changes that have taken place in their life but we also recognize that these non-traditional methods are not proven and that we should study it consider it what it refers to as massage healing touch reflexology stress management yoga hyperbaric chamber treatments some of those things are used in different areas of the country they say with some success [Music] so your human service committee would like to see us study it make some considerations come back next time it has been always my feeling that veterans who become disabled as a result of their service in the military have a right to be compensated for those services and to receive that treatment it's always been a it's also been a consideration of mine that that those services should are the responsibility the federal government that the state government has a responsibility to provide for outreach to bring those people to uh to the services that they deserve and we've made a lot of progress in in those efforts you may see that it's in the bill it says that the legislative management shall consider studying so this is an optional study for them generally when optional studies come to the legislature we pass them over to legislative management and allow them the opportunity to make the decision prioritize those studies this one is one that i think they should consider strongly going forward so we would encourage a yes vote on house bill 1424 further

adopted would prohibit the legislative assembly from considering from considering ratifying or even considering a process to do so any amendment proposed by a runaway constitutional convention the sponsor of this bill said a definition of a runaway in this context would be if the convention were called for a particular issue and then at the same convention the delegates went way beyond their scope and passed something that has nothing to do with the reason the convention was called in the first place a little history if you will your judiciary committee was informed that there has not been a constitutional convention in over 200 years it requires 34 states to ask for a convention and 38 states to ratify any such amendment from a convention so hypothetically if a convention were called for a legitimate reason and at the convention the delegates from the states hypothetically decided to pass a rogue amendment of which they the delegates would be hypothetically overstepping their authority we would not act on this if the resolution were adopted today after hearing the testimony from the sponsor and an individual from out east your judiciary committee decided to leave the hypotheticals where they lie and voted five to two for a do not pass and forward this on to the voters we would ask this chamber to concur and push your red buttons further discussion hearing none will proceed by way of recorded roll call vote the question being the final adoption of house concurrent resolution 3039 with the secretary please open the key all senators all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house concurrent resolution 3039 reveals there are four senators voting yay 41 senators voting made two senators absent not voting the resolution is defeated house concurrent resolution 30 33 mr secretary house concurrent resolution number 3033 a concurrent resolution directing the legislative management to study opportunities to reduce the risk of death and disease among smokers who will not quit smoking by considering tobacco harm reduction strategies that encourage smokers to switch from cigarettes to less risky tobacco products and by accurately informing the public of the health risks posed by smokeless tobacco products vapor products and tobacco derived products relative to cigarettes senator debra mr president house concurrent resolution 3033 is a study resolution sometimes we forget the rules between sessions and somehow this session i've been had to explain to four different legislators the difference between a study and a resolution and a study in a bill three of them were more senior than i am so it was interesting if it says in a study or in a resolution shall study or shall consider study doesn't matter it's an optional study if it says shall study in a bill it's a mandatory study we don't do that very often if it says shall consider studying in a bill then it's an optional study so what we have before us is an optional study to ask the legislative management to consider whether or not there is a benefit to the use of alternative methods not currently being used for nicotine replacement for the purpose of reducing smoking one of the newer products on the market is called an e-cigarette an e-cigarette looks like a cigarette or can look like a cigarette has a little uh piece on the end that when you suck on it will light up like a cigarette has a battery in it you inhale the contents of it what you receive when you inhale that is nicotine when you exhale you exhale water vapor the greatest danger in smoking cigarettes is not from the nicotine it's from the smoke so lung cancer and other diseases that are a problem with smoking are not a problem with e-cigarettes some people think that we should not consider anything that's not fda approved no way know how that what methods were considering in our state as part of tobacco cessation efforts should be the only method so the greatest argument uh in opposition to this resolution was that it's not fda approved well the fda just started regulating cigarettes in march of 2012 so one of the problems with this is that tobacco companies haven't submitted it to the fda for approval so it's not approved it's not disapproved they haven't taken a position on that it's my feeling that whether it's approved or not smoking an e-cigarette is a great benefit to those people who would very dearly love to quit smoking but struggle with that and we've heard some people i received an email earlier that said i haven't smoked a cigarette in some time i'm healthier my doctor's happy and i smell better and i think that's good for all of us as part of the initiated measure that was on the ballot in november e-cigarettes were included as not being approved to be smoked in a in a public building but they really don't provide any uh any problem as far as secondhand smoke so mr president one legitimate concern might be that and we heard from from some high schoolers that um if we study this that we will somehow validate the use of e-cigarettes and they talked about their classmates who go across the street from the high school and in the convenience store and they they purchase e-cigarettes and and they smoke those and and that's not a good thing and i don't disagree with that i i don't know that it's necessarily a gateway to smoking but i'm not sure how the legislature studying this one way or another is going to entice young people to go across the street and buy that you know i'd like to think that they pay attention to what we're doing but i'm not sure that that they do e-cigarettes each one costs about nine or ten dollars and each one lasts about as long as two packs of cigarettes would last with a lot less of a problem mr president earlier in this session we passed a bill that provided for the establishment of a methadone clinic not by the state but by by private interests methadone i attended a conference a few years ago out on the west coast and as part of that we visited a methadone clinic methadone is used as an alternative to heroin heroin and it was interesting to me that one of the people that spoke to us had been attending that methadone clinic every day taking his pill as an alternative to heroin for 30 years and because of that was able to live now a normal life otherwise so mr president there's there can be some benefits to this there might be some downside but i think it's appropriate for the legislature to at least consider studying it and that's what we're asking the body to approve senator heckerman mr president i request a recorded roll call vote on hcr 3033 senator heckman has requested a recorded roll call vote on what otherwise would be a voice vote other eight senators willing to stand in support of senator heckman's request very well we'll proceed by way of recorded roll call vote further discussion on final passage of house concurrent resolution 3033 senator andrist well mr president uh uh i just deserted my libertarian streak here for a few minutes if i may uh the jury has returned on smoking and the news is bad for those that like to smoke smoking is a scourge tobacco's a scourge and nicotine is a scourge in our world it destroys people's health and i think to keep searching for a way to make it safer is a futile effort the best advice i ever heard when i was a much younger state senator was pick your battles uh i picked i've i picked this one as one that we shouldn't fight and i think we need to we need to find a way to white tobacco out of the lives of every american and i think the time will come and we're just forestalling it when we pretend otherwise senator triplett mr president i would um second the remarks um of my good friend from the northwest who just spoke and i would like to add just another concern about the process of of studies that are requested so frequently in our on in this legislature for things that are technical like this process it seems to me that if we don't put a substantial amount of money toward the study so that we can hire consultants who actually have the expertise that we would need to advise an interim committee to be able to make a good decision then all we're doing by approving a study of this sort is offering up a bully pulpit for activists and people who have a particular agenda and we are allowing ourselves to be used um by by particular groups who want some particular result and i i just think that we should be a little more serious and not not take these studies so lightly and and either either fund them so that we can hire professional consultants to advise us or not study them because i think we in this body well collectively we know a lot of things about a lot of things we certainly none of us are experts in in all of these different topics so i would urge a no vote further discussion hearing none the question senator poolman mr president i also have to agree with the senator from district 2 and my students specifically asked me to stand up and speak on this today and we have a lot of students here in the room who are learning through our discussion today that e-cigarettes are okay and that they're a safer alternative and i don't deny that it is absolutely a better alternative to regular tobacco but i'm not sure how we're going to send that message to adults without sending the same message to our kids and so for my students who specifically asked me to speak today i just wanted to throw that out there further discussion senator o'connell would you like to add something looks like there's a little too much smoke or on the other side there mr president i think this is just one more uh tool that we can put in the toolbox a lot of people have tried quit smoking we've all seen the person in the wheelchair with oxygen tank on behind and if we can find out some way to help them get rid of that smoking hab get rid of the cigarettes and some of us got confused on smokeless tobacco the study would also have to tell the general public that this isn't a good source either but i think this is just one tool to help the people who are having trouble trying to quit and maybe make life a little easier for for them and to make their around them a lot better too thanks senator dever mr president i think the students come to see their teacher and i don't know if she got the the vote of the senator from district 45 when she hit him over the head with the microphone that might be one way of doing it mr president i'd just like to point out that that you know with an e-cigarette what we're talking about is providing nicotine to a smoker and that's what they're addicted to they're addicted to the nicotine not the smoke just about everything that we do use for smoking cessation is a nicotine replacement whether it's a gum or a lozenge or a patch that's what their purpose is one of the things that people don't like about this is they're made by tobacco companies instead of drug companies well that's why the fda hasn't weighed in on it but mr president uh i've heard too from people that have had concerns one person spoke to me before the the session about their son who's schizophrenic and smokes continually and how much better and optioned this would be for him than that and mr president i think there's benefits here that that some of us may not realize that we could realize from a study and i'm not sure that it's necessary for us to to hire consultants and by the way if we if we funded it that would be in a bill this is a resolution so mr president uh studies are out there we could pull them together and have conversation during the interim further discussion hearing none we will proceed by way of recorded roll call vote the question being the final adoption of house concurrent resolution 30 33 would the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house concurrent resolution is house concurrent resolution 33 is seven senators voting yay 38 senators voting nay two senators absent and not voting the resolution is defeated next matter how's concurrent resolution 3003 mr secretary house concurrent resolution number 3003 has a fiscal note a concurrent resolution to amend and reenact section 24 of article 10 of the constitution of north dakota relating to allocation of revenue from the oil extract taxes the fiscal note for the o thirteen fifteen by in any revenues general funds it's a deficit of sixteen thousand five hundred under other funds it's a positive amount of sixteen thousand five hundred for the fifteen seventeen biennium under general fund revenues a deficit of two hundred and eighty three thousand under other funds is a positive amount of 283 000 senator nelson mr president couple things today you've seen a number of bills out of judiciary they weren't all 7-0 there were a lot of four threes five twos and a whole lot of discussion however this one does come out seven zero do not pass and part of the reason is that we have house bill 1452 and they're in that there is a study that study deals with the pension plans for public employees what would be the pros and the cons of switching from a defined benefit to a defined contribution that study has not been done but yet this particular resolution which is another thing on the general election ballot and now i think we're at about three pages for that says we're going to amend the constitution to make yet another change in what we do with our oil extraction tax back in 1987 the voters voted that 20 percent of the the revenue from the oil extraction tax would go into a fund to help the common schools trust fund then in 1994 they decided well no they weren't going to put all of that 50 percent into that fund they were going to put excuse me that all of that 20 percent into that that fund they were going to split half and half so now 10 is going to common schools trust fund and 10 is going to a new fund call this the foundation aid stabilization fund now this particular bill is recommending that of that part that's going to the stabilization fund that we take uh 30 and put it into a pension stabilization fund and keep the other 20 in the foundation aid stabilization fund now we had the people from pers come and give us what would happen with the main system keep in mind that there's more pension funds in state pension funds than just the main system there's the teachers fund there's the highway patrol there's the judges there's the national guard there we have a whole lot of political subdivisions which i don't believe would have been included here but this all we got was for the main system and if this plan were used basically we would start putting money away this session or after after the voters voted for it and we would let it sit there until 2046 when the first plan ran out of money and then we would use it now one of the problems that came out was if we do that we're going to have an unfunded liability in that fund at the end of the when it becomes 2046. we would be better off using the recovery plan that is in 1452 that was heard this morning in appropriations and go forward at that and the study that's in that bill and if the study says that something can be done in conjunction with this perhaps next time when there's not as many things on the general election ballot that maybe a change could be made but for now this is not the time and your judiciary committee voted 7-0 do not pass senator city mr president it was actually 6-1 and i'm the one i do believe that this bill is important because the foundation stabilization fund is growing at an unprecedented amounts it's what is it 700 million or something now and i think we only used 5 million out of it about a decade ago meantime when we look at the unfunded liability to our state employees in the six different retirement plans that we were discussing by 2042 it could be six billion dollars yes we have a fix-it plan in another bill that was just referenced but i don't think it would hurt at all to start looking ahead to ensure that our pension funds are rock solid for our state employees and that's why i'm casting a vote in favor of this bill mr president we heard earlier that uh you should probably learn on to pick your fights and i know this fight's over but just you know clarification on this is that the idea behind this fund was that this state i think is interested in looking at changing our retirement plan sometime down the road i think to do that we need to have money put away to to uh to cover our unfunded balances the other thing is to make sure that we notify our employees that whatever we do and however we change our plans that they will be covered if we're going to have discussions on how to change these plans and how we're going to do that money needs to be addressed and and how you're going to fund these unfunded balances this was an attempt to do that maybe it was the wrong fund maybe it's the wrong time but you know as a state if we are going to go down that road these are going to be serious serious things we need to determine and somewhere along the line we have to vote for these senator debra well mr president i learned earlier to pick my fights and this is one that i should be standing up on because this does affect our state employees and i serve as chairman of government and veterans affairs and also chairman of the employee benefits programs committees that deals with retirement program plans and mr president the recovery plan was in 2059 is now in senate bill 1452 which is heard this morning in the house appropriations that recovery plan requires that the members of the plan make the necessary adjustments so that the plan doesn't go broke mr president that's where we need to be not asking the voters to provide funding to bail out a plan that is not otherwise in trouble further discussion hearing none the question is on the final adoption of house concurrent resolution 3003 we'll proceed by way of recorded roll call vote the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house

be recognized the house will continue on the 11th order of business house has before house concurrent resolution 3033 which has been read mr chief clerk mr speaker house concurrent resolution 3033 introduced by representatives thorson and other house and senate sponsors house concurrent resolution 3033 is a concurrent resolution directing the legislative management to study opportunities to reduce the risk of death and disease among smokers who will not quit smoking by considering tobacco harm reduction strategies that encourage smokers to switch from cigarettes to less risky tobacco products and by accurately informing the public of the health risk posed by smokeless tobacco products vapor products and tobacco derived products relative to cigarettes mr speaker the human services committee recommends a do not pass on concurrent resolution 3033 by vote of 12 years 1 a 0 absent and 0 not voting mr speaker representative mooney mr speaker and members of the house your committee on human house human services recommends a do not pass on house concurrent resolution 3033. this resolution asks for legislative management to study smokeless tobacco products vapor e-cigarettes and other tobacco-derived products as alternatives to cigarette smoking the premise being that chew tobacco and vapor products are safer than the inhaled cigarette smoke and that for people unable or unwilling to quit smoking these products would be a better behavior with fewer risks an individual flew in from kentucky to provide testimony in favor of the resolution he spoke of the benefits of swedish snooze the less favorable benefits of the american chews we call snuff and then the the new vapor and tobacco derivative alternative products currently on the market in discussion it was learned that while swedish snooze was used as an example of a tobacco product that safely provides the nicotine hit a nicotine addict requires this product is not available for sale in the united states american snuff while arguably safer than cigarette smoke is not without its health dangers and the new products are still unproven in health risks discussion turned to other points such as what is the actual likelihood of a north dakota sanctioned study or approach to alternative tobacco products having any real impact when you consider that these products plus a whole host of other counter nicotine products and phys and physicians prescribed products are available right now additionally in state sanctioned action to encourage these alternative products and behaviors in the event of early addiction by a teen are we not possibly encouraging an addiction that would very likely lead to cigarette smoking itself worse yet would we not be opening north dakota up to a host of potential liability issues in the case of any of these products ultimately proving to have higher health risks than originally thought and if i may mister speaker i just have to relate to everyone here that once upon a time i was a cigarette smoker i smoked for 15 years i really liked my cigarettes and i can tell you chewing anything was not an alternative it took all my free will and a couple of additional prescribed medicines from doctors to help me actually quit but to be sure it wasn't because there was a lack of product out there it was simply i needed to decide that and so when i look at something like this i just think that uh what we're doing is we're asking for trouble where there is already trouble and we should probably just stay out of it mr speaker members of the assembly with a 13-0 vote your human service committee votes for a do not pass and urges your support with a red vote on house concurrent resolution 3033 thank you is there any discussion representative schatz mr speaker will the bill carrier yield to question representative mooney would you yield to a question yes mr speaker representative schatz representative moody uh how much does the tobacco prevention and cessation advisory spend board spend on advertising against tobacco products mr speaker and representative i don't know the answer to that question as far as how many dollars are actually spent on advertising i know that advertising goes into the schools and and is by and large very widely publicly known perhaps mr chairman gva chairman might know that answer um well i guess if you don't know i guess that's the answer to my question yes and i guess what i i'm reading this bill and i'm looking at it and i'm seeing that this is an alternative to smoking and uh it's a lot cheaper than advertising so i think this bill's got some merit is there any further discussion representative thorson thank you mr speaker and members of the assembly i guess the reason i put this resolution in was to have a conversation about finding other alternatives to smoking we all know that smoking is certainly not good for anyone but there are those people out there who have the nicotine addiction and from the information that i've gathered this may be one way of looking at getting rid of the carcinogens and the other health risks while still helping those people get off the cigarette product i would think that we would want to study all options of doing so you know if people are having health problems from smoking looking at ways of getting them from using that product onto something else and that's why i brought this bill forward i think as we go forward we're going to see a lot more new products coming on the market that we can start to use to break the habit of cigarettes and i think that it would be a wise move for us to study this to come back with answers and not maybe come to conclusions beforehand so again that is why i offered this resolution i would like to see green votes on this i think we can go forward take a look at this during the interim come back and if it truly is harmful by doing this policy and it would encourage smoking then we have in place the knowledge to know that we shouldn't be going forward with this but i would ask the assembly to move this resolution forward thank you mr speaker is there any further discussion seeing not seeing none the house has before it for final consideration house concurrent resolution 30-33 the clerk will open the key and you may record your vote as every member voted does any member wish to change their

reengrossed and amended senate bill 2259 is the bill for an act to create and enact a new subsection of section 55-08-0 1.3 of the north dakota century code relating to historic preservation at state

by vote of 15 years zero and as there are abstinence zero not voting mr speaker representative meyer thank you mr speaker and members of the assembly senate bill 2259 as amended is a very very simple bill it very simply states that prehistoric archaeology archaeological and paleontological values must be preserved if a state park contains a designated historical site the park that this primarily relates to is fort lincoln state park your political subs committee voted a unanimous due pass and we asked the assembly to concur thank you is there any discussion seeing none the house has before

before senate bill 2033 which has been read mr chief clerk mr speaker senate bill 2033 introduced by the legislative management at the request of the information technology committee senate bill 2033 is a bill for knack demand and reenact section 54-35-15.2 on subsection 8 of section 54-59-05 and section 54-59-23 of the north dakota century code relating to the definition of a large information technology project mr speaker your appropriations committee recommends due bass on senate bill 2033 i voted 21 years zero nays and one absent and zero not voting mr speaker representative striley thank you mr speaker mr speaker members assembly this bill is pretty straightforward it changes the definition of a major i.t project from 250 000 to 500 000. a couple reasons for the change and this was discussed thoroughly during the interim as well in the i.t committee uh currently right now there's only two projects under a half a million dollars so there's very few projects anymore that fall below that uh hence was the reason for the change under the current uh 2013 excuse me the next 2013-2015 biennium there's only three projects that would fall below this so your appropriations committee along with the interim i.t committee who moved this forward felt that it was appropriate change being the cost of everything has gone up and there's very few of these projects actually fall below that and furthermore the uh staffing requirements if if itd was to have to over see oversight on every project would be burdensome as well so with that your appropriations committee recommends do pass with a 21-0 vote is there any discussion seeing none the house has before for final consideration senate bill 2033 the clerk will open the key and you may record your vote as every member voted does any member wish to change the vote key will be closed and the clerk will take the record the final votes was 94 years zero names zero absent not voting senate bill 2033 is declared past continuing on the 14th order of business house says before senate bill 2034 which has been read mr chief clerk mr speaker and senate and girls senate bill 2034 introduced by legislative management at the request of the information technology committee and gross senate bill 2034 is a bill for not to create and enact a new section to chapter 54-59 of the north dakota century code relating to information technology projects and the creation of an executive steering committees for information technology projects mr speaker your appropriations committee recommends do pass on senate bill 2034 i voted 28 000 a's two absent and zero not voting mr speaker representative kampanek mr speaker members of the assembly uh 2034 is a new section in uh chapter 59. uh basically what it is is it's it sets up in code a steering committee last summer the governor set up a steering committee but it was felt in the i.t committee that we should uh codify this and so that's basically what this does and it's for major i.t projects is what it is and we've found over the course of the years that uh major projects that do not uh follow a structured path that they usually run into trouble and so this this is this another tool that we got in here of these major i.t projects that we want want the agencies to follow and so that's basically what it does it's an executive steering committee it consists

complicated public utility applications the commission is handling an increasingly increasing number of public utility related cases due to the state's energy boom and the corresponding increase increasing investment in utility plants many of these cases are highly complex and require more and different expertise than the commission has on staff or simply require more time than the staff have available the commission has the philosophy that is most efficient to outsource staff work on specialized cases when necessary rather than add ftes this offers the commission the taxpayers and most importantly the utility rate payers the benefit of vigorous research analysis and legal representation by persons with specific expertise targeted to the specific needs of the particular case without reducing the staff time available for other regulatory work or adding ftes or otherwise impacting the state's general fund the commission provided a number of recent examples of rate cases that exceeded the statutory limit the commission is able to assess therefore requiring the commission to utilize funds from their appropriation any unused application fees are returned to the applicant ensuring that the public service commission is not assessing fees to generate revenue the utility utility shareholders of north dakota testified as neutral on senate bill 2112 and indicated that they appreciate the work that the commission has done in the past related to rate cases and understands that there are increasing costs related to these rate cases members of the assembly your committee on

zero not voting mr speaker representative drubdahl twosonduck mr speaker mr speaker and members of the assembly house senate bill 2217 was brought forward by a couple of representatives that represent the state of north dakota in the streamlined sales tax agreement that we've been a member of a full member of since 2005 and been participating since 2001 when it first started organizing under north dakota century code we have two different chapters to deal with our sale and use tax the first one is the one we've had in place back since back in 1930s when we first put sales tax into effect the second one we created when we joined the streamline sales tax with the language on them is complementary but there was some language we did not take from the one code and put in the other code because we didn't need it we are finding that it's probably important to have some of that on section one of this bill is that does just that it takes a practice that we currently do and that is that the consumer not the not the business is responsible for our sales and use tax and it puts it into the streamline sales tax language the the reason that's important is for like city sales tax in city lodging tax and city tax on automobiles if we don't include that language that the consumer is responsible for the tax then it is considered part of the sale price and north dakota imposes five percent sale tax on it we don't want to do that and this legislative body never wanted to do that so that's why section one is moved in is presented in this bill section two of the bill is uh is adjustment language north dakota has always used point of destination for our sales tax responsibility in other words if you if i order something from any guard from anywhere else in the nation and it's shipped into arnegard the sales tax if it's collected is due for the state of north dakota at five percent and if arnegaard had a sales tax arnegard receive that sales tax that's the way north dakota has always done their business and will continue section two though does give north dakota an option as it does to a number of other states now as i said we belong to this organization where about half 50 percent of the states that collect sales tax currently are members of this organization some of those that are not and and like new york city new york california texas arizona colorado the reason they won't join is because they have point of origin in other words if i order something from any guard from the state of new york and it's shipped from the new york and they charge a sales tax new york gets the sales tax that's why they don't join this section two says that we have an option as we always have had to either have point of origin or point of destination but only intra state shipments in other words anything going out of state we'll still have a liability to send the tax to that state if if our business is voluntary are doing that all of the collection of taxes from from businesses that do not have nexus in the state of north dakota are voluntary and this is just kind of cleanup language uh it has no fiscal in effect at all so the committee boarded i think 11 11-0 do pass and we hope you'll concur thank you is there any discussion representative casper thank you mr speaker with the bill carrier yield 2 question representative druvdel would you yield to a question mr speaker i will representative casper thank you mr speaker representative druvdahl in section one under on the underlined language does is this allowing any out-of-state entity or the streamlined sales tax organization to require north dakota to impose any additional taxes on the taxpayer that this this legislative body has not agreed to or imposed mr speaker and representative casker that's a good question absolutely not the only one that can pose new taxes is the body the legislative body and the governor uh it just put it straightening up language that's currently in there it will have no effect on any taxes whatsoever thank you mr speaker thank you representative is there any further discussion scene none the house has before for final consideration senate bill

it became important that a collection methodology be adopted that will bring parity between the prepaid and postpaid systems current north dakota law contains legal ambiguities that hindered

fees while minimizing the new costs and burdens on their retailers senate bill 2261 is designed to level the playing field plug holes in the one one fee collection system and ensures that prepaid wireless subscribers contribute their proportional share it is not a new tax it is merely everyone paying their fair share the fee will be applied to all prepaid wireless services at the rate of two percent the fee will be collected from the customer by the seller and remitted to the tax department transparency is the name of the game with the seller being required to disclose the amount of fee to the customer this prepaid point of sale method should provide a more stable and predictable source of revenue the seller may piggyback the 911 fees collected with their sales and use tax collections when remitting them to the tax department thus minimizing any additional cost to the realtor the excuse me the retailer a seller may not elect to collect the two percent fee if the prepaid wireless service that accompanies a prepaid wireless device is of a minimal amount and suggested 10 minutes or less or five dollar fee or less the fees are paid to the tax department then given to the state treasurer who then transfers the money to the newly created prepaid wireless emergency nine one one fee fund that's then sent to the joint the governing joint powers entity which was created to administer the emergency communication system initially the seller is compensated for the collection of the fees setting up the system and training their employees by being allowed to keep all fees collected for the first three months after that they can retain three percent the effective date of the bill is delayed until january 1 2014 to allow for the training of personnel and the

mN-BIQtRaA8,MD,03-20-2012,our sponsor only 967 1026 will have a full committee hearing for those who are testifying on those two bills we do have a three-minute uh time role here in the health and government operations committee if you're here to testify on those two bills we ask that you provide your testimony within the three minute time frame if you're part of a panel and a delegate asked a question we ask just one person from the panel respond to the delegate's question if you have a cell phone we'd appreciate if you were if you could turn it either off or one to vibrate again we would appreciate that i see we have delegate miller here so let's take up house bill 1272. house bill 1272 is entitled public health electronic cigarette distribution to miners prohibited delegate miller thank you chairman hammond vice chair pendergrass and members of the hgo committee good afternoon my name is aruna miller and i'm here to testify on behalf of house bill 1272 to prohibit the sale of electronic cigarettes to miners i'd like to thank delegates bobo and frosh for their work previously on the 2010 house bill 720 that it aimed to address the use of non-tobacco nicotine products house bill 1272 focuses only on one non-tobacco product electronic cigarettes or e-cigarette is a battery operated device that mimics the look the feel and the taste of a traditional cigarette there is no tobacco there is no smoke yet e-cigarettes deliver a steady dose of nicotine filled odorless vapor that smokers often crave let me demonstrate here's a real cigarette and here's an e-cigarette this i can smoke here in the h2 hgo committee this i cannot so if it walks like a duck quacks like a duck and looks like a duck then it must be a duck unlike the fda approved smoking cessation products such as nicotine gums and patches e-cigarettes are not marketed as a way to quit smoking but rather as a smoking alternative to continue a lifelong nicotine addiction as they do nothing to interrupt the hand to mouth behavior that is an integral part of the habit the american lung association has urged the fda to act immediately to halt the sale and distribution of all e-cigarettes the fda is appealing a u.s district court ruling that the agency lacks authority to regulate the devices as drugs because they are recreational and not therapeutic six states to date have restricted their sale including new hampshire arizona oregon minnesota colorado and new jersey more than 1.25 million people buy e-cigarette products sales revenues for e-cigarettes have been growing at a rate of two hundred percent annually where it is projected to be a billion dollar industry why well here's a couple of you know facts that are unique to e-cigarettes versus a real cigarette e-cigarettes do not have the added cost of tobacco taxes they do not contain any health warnings such as conventional cigarettes or fda approved nicotine replacement products they can be used virtually anywhere like an airport a restaurant and right here in the hgo committee room and best of all not only does the east cigarette industry continue to keep nicotine addicted adult consumers alive they can target a much bigger consumer group the youth who are likely to become lifelong consumers realizing this new market the e-cigarette industry's clever marketing schemes has added novelty flavors such as bubble gum butter popcorn and cookie dough and trendy packaging colors that appeal to the youth and besides making them look like real cigarettes they're also made to look like cigars pipes and pens they can be purchased online in malls and at convenience stores in maryland there is no age restriction on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors nicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to break and smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death in the united states e-cigarettes are not a safe smoking alternative but rather their cleverly disguised gadgets that lead to the same dangerous health hazards and life-long addiction of of traditional cigarettes with urgency i request the committee's favorable report on house bill 1272 to prohibit the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes to minors i'll be happy to take any questions you may have very good any questions for the sponsor of the bill okay where to begin delegate collison thank you mr chair a real question um this actually delivers nicotine that's right so um so the addictive factors of cigarettes are present in the electronic cigarette absolutely and in some cases delta coulson the amount of nicotine that's actually delivered is like 10 times more than of a regular cigarette thank you are there additional questions delegate frank then delegate ready how does the smoke come out of the cigarette that was actual smoke that came out or what is that that's a great question delegate it's actually vapor and when you do this they call it vaping so you suck in and this odorless vapor comes out that's how it works and when you suck in you actually get a dose of nicotine right okay exactly thank you mr chairman so this all right i'm sorry i walked in late but is this already is not illegal it's not illegal for miners to purchase these now that's correct miners can purchase these and these can be smoked in any um you know office space or any buildings right now okay i just saw somebody on saturday with one so i'm not a miner but yeah an older gentleman but anyway okay thank you are there any additional questions thank you very much thank you concludes the bill hearing on house bill 1272 see delegate james should come going down we have uh delegate james medicaid sustainability commission house bill 1341. mr chairman i know it's sponsor only but could i bring people in case there are questions that's fine i would appreciate that so i'll be doing joined by valerie overton and denise patriciani for answering questions and the likes so house bill 1341 which is cross-filed as senate bill 953 creates a medicaid sustainability commission consisting of of key stakeholders needed to analyze and make recommendations about the future of maryland's medicaid program the commission is to issue an initial report on its findings and recommendations to the governor and the legislature by december 15th with the final report due june 30th 2013. you'll recall that last year we included language in the budget asking the department of health and mental hygiene to convene a work group of experts to address medicaid cost containment and revenue actions and report back to us with recommendations because we knew the hospital's medicaid deficit assessment and other actions were causing pressure on maryland's medicaid waiver the work prescribed in the budget language was assigned to the medicaid advisory committee while that committee does a very excellent job in terms of oversight of the health choice program adding evaluation of a long-term sustainability of the entire medicaid program and evaluation of medicaid expenditures is a lot to put on anyone's plate the report was received recognized that the use of the medicaid deficit assessment isn't sustainable in the long term and that the governor and general assembly should address these issues on an annual basis through the budget process i do not believe annual programmatic cuts and continued deficit assessments are a long-term solution however i also understand it's been suggested that medicaid sustainability is not a medicaid issue but a waiver issue i would argue in the opposite the medicaid deficit assessment has hastened the erosion of our waiver cushion by three percent in fact we learned two weeks ago that the waiver cushion is below one percent not solely but in some large measure due to the medicaid deficit assessments last year the health services cost review commission estimated that maryland would fail the waiver test as early as 2013 which would result in a potentially potentially a loss of 1.6 billion dollars in federal payments now i know there's a lot of negotiations going on i know the state is going as early as april to talk to the at the federal level about a revision to our waiver uh our waiver test quite frankly i think everyone agrees that it is not modern enough and does not capture all the good work we're doing at the state level in terms of cost containment particularly with hospitals but with that said um these tax caps as you know there's a proposal uh before the president right now that's looking at capping these uh these assessments at around four and a half percent in 2015 and going down to three and a half percent by 2017. if you look at our assessments at this point um we're at already 5.6 percent so we start out already ahead of what's before the the president in in the proposal imagine if something like that were passed on what that would do immediately to the state's budget now we have nearly a million people on the medicaid rolls in two more years we're going to have another 240 000 people will be added that's a lot of growth we need to come to terms now and figure out how to sustain this program into the future we've relied on the help that came in the form of federal aid during the recession but that up money is obviously gone and i do not see those kinds of funds coming again from the federal government at this point we have a bit of a patchwork approach but i know maryland i know the way we work and i know that we are in a position to think in in the future in a strategic long-term way and this bill is a start toward that process thank you very much mr chairman and members of the committee for your attention mh do you have any comment on those honestly uh dhmh did not provide me with copies of those amendments and i know the bill's been around for a long time so i'm surprised that no one came by to show them to me it essentially replaces the commission uh with a required report on issues relating to the sustainability of the medicare waiver test that's okay i'll follow up with you okay okay are there any questions for the sponsor of the bill very good thank you very much very much chairman concludes the bill hearing on house bill 1341 we will now turn to delegate walker in house bill 1407. house bill 1407 is entitled dhmh work group on cancer clusters and environmental causes of cancer delegate walker uh thank you mr chair members of the committee before i start testimony because they may have to leave they've got a bus to get on at 1 30. but i like the members of the prince george's county student government association from their respective schools the police stand so they can be acknowledged they've been trailing me today we had some interesting debate uh you would have been proud of them the way that they debated the things like compulsory attendance and tattoo prohibitions and things of that nature so it was very informative um and also you see they've got red bags here those are recyclable bags so we're trying to i know that means a lot to you delegate hover uh welcome to annapolis thank you yes uh house bill 1407 uh you heard the title of the bill but in the state of maryland there are 143 super fund sites uh these are things that the environmental protection agency is named hazardous waste sites and 12 of them are on a national priority list house bill 1407 will require that the department of health and mental hygiene along with the maryland department of environment convene a work group to investigate the existence of cancer clusters in the state also examine the potential environmental causes of cancer and dhmh must report to the governor and the general assembly the work groups findings by december 1 2012 department of health and mental hygiene reports over twenty six thousand cases of cancer on the maryland cancer registry and the scene the center for disease control ranks the district of columbia one and the state of maryland number eight for the mortality rate of breast cancer which can largely be attributed to environmental factors such as chemical agents and toxins in the air water and soil well you all know that maryland ranks eight an incidence of pancreatic cancer as well as other environmental causes such as uh hodgkin's lymphoma pancreatic renal cell and brain cancers myself like many others have been profoundly affected by the misfortune of family friends and colleagues who have been diagnosed with cancer so the beer bill supporters here today will testify uh the impact that cancer not only has on their families but on the survivors of families organize supporters of this bill of the maryland state medical society the american cancer society aquifers health institute and the maryland sierra club i just think that given the devastating impact that cancer's had on individuals and families and communities in the state as a whole we should agree that whenever our constituents suspect that toxins in the air water or soil could be the cause of these cancer clusters in their community the state must be aggressive and we must be taken to this objectively to investigate and consider the environmental factors that might be the culprit issue support house bill 1407 because the bottom line is our lives and the lives of our families and our families families very well depend on it okay very good any questions for the sponsor of the bill thank you very much delegate walker that concludes the bill hearing on 1407. thank you all so much delegate schmiegel house bill 1421 is entitled health youth camps application fees for certification delegate smeagle mr chairman members of the health and government operations committee pleasure to be back amongst you um in a nutshell what happened with uh 1421 is i was contacted by some a local gentleman who has a summer camp uh he runs a dance studio has all kinds of children come from all over the county to the dance studio in the summer he wants to keep some of the kids involved and has them come in and you may do tap hip-hop jazz during the uh year and take these classes maybe you want to try ballet or something else and you'd come in all of a sudden now their fees jumped from 100 uh dollars at the max uh i think it was give me one second one hundred seventy five to a hundred dollars for the fees and all of a sudden the department the hmh moved it up to from two hundred to two thousand dollars you can run i called up to try to find out what's going on and the response was well they took it out of our budget we got to get it somewhere is exactly what i was told i said the problem is a lot of these people who are running these camps for children had sent out their brochures had estimated their cost had told these kids they could come in at this cost had given out scholarships had set it up so kids would have a place to go during the summer and because their budget gets cut they decide they're going to make it up by sticking it to these camp owners which means kids won't get their scholarships kids won't get to go to these things and to say that there's some cost involved when the safety check amounts to making sure you got your shots now there's some larger camps yes where you have um archery and horseback riding and things like that there may be a need for inspections but certainly it should be tied to the cost of doing the inspection not to something that's going to keep kids from being able to go and attend these things um doing and then the whole way they classify what's a camp turns out to be a problem because if you take an activity that you were taking previously and so you may be taking two kinds of dance and you want to try a new one and because you're taking a new one now you're into a camp and not some sort of uh another activity that would not hit this large fee so we put the bill in delegate rudolph and i also had people in his jurisdiction who were requesting it we both put the bills in we've been working with the department we think we have some uh answers that uh we're going to be able to work this out we're trying we i think we're going to get there um i spoke with delegate rudolph this morning the one thing that we're trying to get down to is it looks like the fee they're going to take which now they made for a 40 four years they're going to split the fee over so if you got hit with a 2 000 fee instead of being per year they're going to make it over four years and then five hundred dollars would be applied to each year cutting it down three quarters of what the cost was is going to be a significant help to those uh camps that are trying to provide places for our children to have some place to go so they're not hanging out the streets part of this bill also what we were looking to do is require that they come through this committee instead of setting these regulations and just setting these huge amounts so that they have to come through and you and get approval and show some sort of a need for this it looks like we're going to get things worked out i'm working with delegate uh rudolph on this and i think that we'll be able to work something out but i would like to bring your attention to it keep keep it on your radar so that we don't have our children not having a place to go during the summer times any sponsor oh yeah any questions for the sponsor of the bill any sponsor problems you're saying sorry not at all not at all can you follow up with us uh with regards to most certification with the department thank you very much for your time i appreciate it thank you very much that concludes the bill here on house bill 1421 we will now turn to delegate cost in house bill 1455. house bill 1455 is entitled mortality and quality review committee reporting requirement sunset extension thank you mr chairman members of committee house bill 1455 is a very important bill but very easy bill as in regards to just extending the sunset on the mortality and quality review committee that this committee formed i believe it was in like 1996 or something like that but what it does is it protects the most vulnerable of our population with the dda community mental health association uh in regards to uh these providers and and it requires them to evaluate and and report back to office health care quality any incidences that regard serious injury or death and it helps in regards to the quality of of these providers and it's just the sunset extension i urge the committee's favorable unanimous support any questions for the sponsor of the bill thank you very much that concludes the bill hearing on house bill 1455 we're waiting uh for delegate catch and delegate durant delegate tran is supposed to be testifying for delegate turner on house bill 1026 both are members of the insurance subcommittee uh insurance subcommittee is currently in session so they're fully walking down the steps right now to testify on their bill so if you can be patient give us about two or three minutes if not i'll go ahead and introduce the bills okay so very good okay let's now turn to house bill 967 delegate catch uh hospital 967 is entitled pregnancy outcomes confidential statistical reporting requirements delegate catch yes uh before i begin i i um please take a close look at the bill and notice that uh the very stiff penalties in place for uh if any of the information on doctors on uh persons who have had an abortion or the clinics if the names are divulged the penalties are very very strict because for obvious reasons anyhow as the chairman said this legislation would require that the state of maryland collect abortion statistics we're only one of four states in this nation that does not collect these statistics there is a third party called gutmacher institute which does survey across the country for these statistics and from them we do know that maryland's abortion rate is 48 higher than the national abortion rate we have no way of knowing whether or not the information is accurate the current estimate is that there's 35 000 abortions occurring each year in maryland which is the fourth highest rate in the nation and we need these abortion statistics we need good data in order to take measures to reduce the abortion rate in our state we as a state we should not be relying on a third party statistics we collect statistics on every other surgical procedure and it's time for us to collect these statistics to in order to protect women's health and safety prior to 2008 statistics on abortions in maryland were collected on a voluntary basis and the data collection was terminated as of april 15 2008 simply because the number of doctors and agencies that were reporting continued to diminish so really these statistics didn't have much value at all it's interesting to note that the cdc the centers for disease control says that abortion statistics are very important for maternal health it's important to define characteristics of women at high risk for unintended pregnancy and to evaluate the effectiveness of programs to prevent unintended pregnancies if you remember last year delegate missouri had legislation that increased by several million dollars the amount the money going to prevention of pregnancies this was i believe to raise the medicaid for uh for this by uh to the 200 percent level and um in the bill and the fiscal note the thought was that this would reduce abortions by 2650 a year in the state of maryland but if you think about this reasonably how do we know if this 2 million dollar investment is really going to result in fewer abortions in the state of maryland if we don't have any statistics again only four states in this nation do not collect this data and why wouldn't we as a state want this data so that we can identify those areas of possible problems of you know abortions are increasing in this area decreasing in that area so that we can figure out where it is we can intercede and help people to avoid this surgery what about the number of repeat abortions i mean we certainly don't want women having one abortion after the other we need to identify uh you know what the problem is and uh what strategies the state can uh come up with to avoid this very serio serious procedure what about late-term abortions i mean how many are there in this state do we do we know if there are why are there so many what can we do to try to reduce this number um you know we you know as a state we're very interested in medical statistics i mean that's that's for certain i mean we collect all kinds of statistics and you know again i imagine it's for political reasons that we don't collect this particular statistic which i think is is a big mistake the united states supreme court found that the requirement that quote that abortion facilities follow a report on each abortion is constitutional because it rationally furthers the state's legitimate interest in advancing the state of medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prenatal life in gathering statistical information with respect to patients while keeping the reports completely confidential and again let me just go to the bill itself look at the penalties that i have in place for any of this information getting out regarding doctors patients and clinics because we don't certainly don't want anyone harassed if you look um at the maryland catholic conference their testimony you'll find a copy of the state's last report which was done in 2008 on the number of abortions if you look at that report you'll see no doctors names no patient names no clinic names in this report and if this bill is passed you will see no patient's names no doctor names and no clinic names in the report it'll just be numbers you know i can see no valid reason not to collect the abortion data and i can see many reasons for us to collect it so that we can help as a state help women to avoid this procedure of abortion uh i mean there's just so many ways that through birth control pills etc that women can avoid unwanted pregnancy and i just think for the good of these women and society we need to be able to identify the areas where we're having the problems and come up with strategies to address the issue of unwanted pregnancy so we can avoid abortion as an alternative thank you mr chairman thank you questions let's begin with delegate hubbard then turn to delegate durant yes we do so what we're talking about private clinics and private pay that's exactly right as is the additional numbers to be collected in yes yes exactly exactly right okay so we know what the numbers are in reference to medicaid because that's in the budget that is correct but we don't know what the numbers are what's going on outside in reference to private clinics private hospitals and private pay patients that's exactly right thank you thank you chairman hammond i was i had the same question uh pretty much as uh delegate hubbard had however i didn't see in the bill that it would uh specifically say that it would be private uh physicians offices it just says facilities and hospitals and does it in capture that are we certain that it will pull in yeah i unfortunately i ran out of the uh our subcommittee i don't have the bill in front of me but he didn't but you make sure that i'm going to cover that yeah it covers it will cover any abortion that takes place in the state of maryland yes okay would be reported okay yes and then the other thing just a point of clarification the bill that uh delegate uh mazir and senator pugh sponsored the family planning bill would it's not so much for abortions as much as it is educate young women on their um uh reproductive choices that that they don't have to have a baby by 21 which might be known in their community you'll be an old maid if you don't have a baby by certain time that you can wait for a longer period of time a more mature parent so so actually in that particular uh ability reference it's not so much that we need to keep track of of abortions in that one that was more of making sure that uh people had uh the necessary family planning prior to getting pregnant we were almost doing it the wrong way you you look to address a teenager uh when they're pregnant versus when you should address them when they're not pregnant or they're not sexually active in this way we'd have better outcomes we would save a ton of money that way before they even got active but i do appreciate this legislation i always felt that uh poor people were targeted as far as the numbers and and and be held out there as some single poor mother uh having abortions when actually i know from being in sales uh calling on uh abortion clinics that the people in the wealthier parts of my district uh had the benefit of going to a private position and getting an abortion and never would be recorded in those numbers so i thank you for this legislation and let me just say you you misunderstood my testimony because my point was that the fiscal note for the missouri bill said that we would have 2650 fewer abortions and my point is uh okay how do we know if it's working and if it's not working what strategies can we put in place to help these young women that want to wait until they're 21 or 22 in order to become pregnant and and have a child so the whole purpose behind this bill is what can we do to help the people of the state of maryland to avoid an unwanted pregnancy and avoid abortion so uh it it and this is how are we doing as a state when i look at this scootmarker statistics that show that supposedly we're number four in the country as far as abortions go and uh you know we're 48 percent higher than the national average i would hope to prove they're wrong and i would also hope to show that as each year goes on that the number of abortions are going to go down in the state i appreciate your comments very much thank you mr chairman this bill would some of the statistic would we would be reporting on the racial makeup and the age makeup of the people who received abortion because sitting on a subcommittee like i did with minority health disparities this is one area that um i think is under reported when we talk about abortion right um so would that would this be part of that or would this this would collect those statistics correct right right we're collecting right okay and actually you the the bill you bring up that we voted for i was proud to vote for last year um i that was part of the the testimony i believe was was that it would um maybe help to to stop as many unwanted pregnancies from happening um do is there any insight that you have on on the nature of the practice as far as it being used for but there were there wouldn't be any recordation of reasons for why someone got this though right it would just so it would be completely private so there would no be it wouldn't be this many people did this or that for this reason right so there's no concern on that front no okay thank you thank you it would be uh you know what point of the pregnancy did the abortion take place uh it would be helmet etcetera that's that's what it would be if you take a look at the uh maryland catholic conference there's a a copy of the report from 2008 and what we have in mind is just that same thing same report that the state issued thank you mr chair um delia catch your intent um in gathering these statistics are um to try to to implement cultural and environmental changes that would decrease the number of abortions in the state is that am i characterizing that i would say that okay if we find that there's a particular area where we are not being successful in reducing abortions the number of abortions that as a state that we develop strategies to try to assist women in that that particular group uh so that they don't have to go through this particular procedure uh whether it be cultural changes whatever i mean that may very well be what is decided on in order to to reduce the pregnancy rate in that particular area but the bottom line is to reduce the overall number of your intent yes okay so wouldn't it also work without stigmatizing any of the any women who make this choice to simply identify programs and support young people and people and women at risk of um you know becoming pregnant without wanting to to put those programs in place i don't know that the numbers actually help i guess is what i'm saying if the bottom line is we want to create an environment where this becomes a choice that people don't make more often than not then it seems to me then it's incumbent on us to put the programs that will facilitate the prevention into action much more thoroughly well i and and the concern that i have is any program that's designed to reduce unwanted pregnancies how do we know it's working i mean that that's the question how do we know it's working for instance last year with the uh missouri bill which wrote you know which increased by two million dollars the amount we're going to spend on family planning with those who are up to 200 percent of the poverty rate the the indication was in the fiscal note that we're going to reduce pregnancies or abortions by 2 650 which is a laudable goal and and the question is is it working and if not if it's not work how are we going to know if it's not working unless we have the numbers and if it's not working then what has to be done or what can we do to try to make the program more effective that's in place and so that's that's what is in mind okay i guess i feel like we'd have some of that information just by virtue of the people who are taking advantage of those programs but um it's a um you know a philosophical issue yeah okay thank you thank you mr chairman um a couple of questions uh you have i don't have the bill in front of me i'm sorry i left our subcommittee ran out so i don't have the bill well i just got the bill thank you i thought you had it committed to memory as you have most things that we deal with here um the uh couple questions it looks to me like there's a pretty serious uh penalty to physicians who may terminate the pregnancy report misdemeanor etc is that correct say that again it looks like on page five of the bill you have some pretty serious penalties for physicians who may fail to submit the reports as required i'm using the language here on page five line eight and nine so then they could be subject to disciplinary action by the board and uh some things like that right and then there's other penalties for an individual however that applies maybe the physician staff i suppose who does those things and may not complete the form so you have a number of questions in the bill for example the number of pregnancies marital status all kinds of things that are to be required outlined on page three and four so what if that information is submitted and for one reason or another because of the nature of things that happen in health care it's inaccurate uh the person says um i'm married but they single or they say i'm single but they're actually married for whatever reason then then it looks to me like uh they have not the provider or their staff has not completed the forms required to be subject to pretty serious penalties is that accurate i would not think so because uh it says the word willfully in line 12 uh let's see well that says in line 12 but not in line let me see in line 6 through 11 6 through 11 um see i guess it would be um what you're talking about is the accuracy of the information in other words if someone were to give the doctor saying yes i'm married when when they're not married is that is that what you're getting any number you have a lot of question here so any any part of it yeah could be construed is failing to report submit the report is required by subsections a b or c and that physician is guilty i supposed to apply to others as well we can leave that let me move on to the next question i i certainly uh that was not the intention my goodness if somebody gives the doctor information that's not accurate i mean you can't hold the doctor responsible for that okay um the bill on page two starts with the pregnancy is terminated there are a lot of pregnancies that are terminated that are not uh of necessarily the abortion type that are sense you know cause most people and the anxiety that we deal with here all the time for example there's spontaneous abortions there's threatened abortions there's miscarriages a whole range of things um and and there's inevitable abortions where perhaps the abortion miscarriages started the patient's bleeding the fetus is partially expelled and uh the physician or provider terminates you know finishes the job so to speak that nature has started would looks to me like these are all going to be captured in here is that correct uh it appears that way now uh that sounds like a very friendly amendment too i don't know about that but those uh it's not get carried away i'm just reading the bill trying to understand it there way to me that would be a friendly amendment too there's a lot of definition also there's medicines like plan b and things like that that some folks think block implantation of the uh of embryo i mean just you know one cell early on is that going to be construed as an abortion so every time a physician practitioner nurse practice that certainly sounds like a friendly amendment i have another thought i really appreciate your your efforts to improve the bill i think that i think your ideas are are excellent then i appreciate your support go ahead i think i better stop there i appreciate very much some other approaches to solve this problem you're helping you're helping with the bill i appreciate it yeah well we'll see are there any additional questions of the sponsor though delegate frank delegate i want to revisit something i think you said earlier you said that on april 15 2008 we stopped collecting abortion statistics yes why what was the reason for that again well if you take a look at the report that was issued uh the number of reporting the number of people reporting was going going down so because it was voluntary reporting so you know why collect partial statistics it just didn't seem to be of any value whatsoever so the state gave it up okay and i think you also said that there's no other surgical procedure in the state that we collect no statistics on is that correct abortion is the only one yes i'm not sure if dhmh is going to be testifying but they did submit a letter of concern and i just want to read the third paragraph and ask you to respond to it this is the department of health for the state of maryland and they say that the bill provides for no specified purpose for the collection of these data no proposed use for the data and no actions to be taken based on the data there is no clear public health benefit or application that will result from mandating these registries so this is the department of health saying that there's no public benefit no public health benefit to finding out what is estimated to be 35 000 abortions performed in the state of maryland every year do you want to respond to that well i i i think that's a very regretful uh statement because uh first of all uh with the gut mocker institute saying that we have the fourth highest number of abortions in the united states i mean i would hope that's not true but if we as a state expect to reduce the number of abortions then we need to know how many are occurring and in which particular situation they're occurring so that we can come up with strategies to reduce the number of abortions as i go back to the mazor bill from last year it said that we're by passing this bill by spending the couple million dollars that we're going to reduce abortions by 2650 in the state laudable gold but we don't know if it's that's indeed the situation and so how else are we going to know if what we did last year is working unless we have the statistics so i i really you know don't agree at all with the department's uh concern about the statistics being gathered for no reason because there there is a reason thank you thank you mr chairman um you brought up some good points i hadn't read the dhmh letter but we're already collecting medicaid statistics and the dhmh letter basically said there's going to be a significant fiscal impact on providers and the department i'm not sure how how would you see that if they're already if they're already reporting medicaid data the same many of the same providers and they're already i guess dhm is already collecting data on one subgroup depending on how they're they're paying for it why would it be such a significant i guess i should ask them i don't know if they're testifying physical impact when they're already collecting the data for one we're collecting on one type is stellar terrain set one type of people poor people people that are on medicaid but we're not collecting it on private pay people so what why the discrepancy well i to be honest with you i i suspect that uh you know if an agency doesn't particularly like the bill that one of the ways to discourage the legislature from passing the bill is to state that it's going to have a significant fiscal effect on the state i mean you you've hit the nail on the head though my goodness if they're already collecting statistics for medicaid uh then there's should be no reason why this can't be done and and i can't imagine the cost would be that uh much higher let me ask another question on the actual bill language how does this build language compare to the language to collect the medicaid data is it similar in in scope of what would be collected as what we're collecting now for medicaid the only thing that i've ever seen of the medicaid medicaid data myself is uh the number of medicaid-funded abortions that are done in the state i i really don't know uh beyond that what the requirements are okay and one last question um when i read this dhmh i was sort of surprised too because i supported the um money last year and i think we all did yes i think it's a good idea i don't think anybody disagrees that we should try to reduce unwanted pregnancy i don't think anybody disagrees with that and um they pretty much say there's no specified purpose to collecting data but um we had his health disparities issue with infant mortality last year and there was some possible connection between infant mortality and premature birth and abortion and i don't know if there's any data in other states but would that be a specified purpose just we have a very high infant mortality and premature birth uh rate in maryland and i never heard the statistics that you just talked about being way higher than the other rest of the country but would that be a specific purpose that we could ask them to look at infant mortality and premature birth to see if it's somehow related related and look at other i mean i don't know but it seems like there's a lot of purposes that we could draw conclusions to if we knew that i mean right and you know if we're really interested in women's health then those kinds of issues would i mean that would be something that would be good to to see if there is a correlation and yes that that would be something we could do and and uh if indeed there's a correlation then uh hopefully we'd be able to uh improve the infant mortality rate in the state of maryland okay thank you we wouldn't have any we wouldn't have any control over facilities outside the state of maryland to report this will we no so there's there's an estimate on here that four to six percent of the abortions that are performed privately are performed out of state so we just have to we'd have to just do without those numbers yeah you know i wonder if uh if they're done out of state whether or not they count but with that state's abortion numbers i i don't know you know what i mean i was just wondering because it seems like you're if you're trying to catch the private facilities and the private pay a lot of times people go out of state on private pay and private facilities for right no other reason than the social the social economic issues involved in it and and maybe people come to maryland uh from pennsylvania virginia whatever to utilize our facility so maybe it would end up evening out in the long run i i don't know just to follow up on this question said it was collected in 2008 yes voluntarily okay and do you know if anything was done with that data what if anything was done with those numbers i i think those those numbers really had no you couldn't use them because it was all voluntary how about so if you so in other words let's say you have uh you know 10 clinics and five doctors one year and then the next year uh eight clinics and 12 doctors i mean it's it didn't give a true picture of what's going on in the state of maryland so you really couldn't those statistics really wouldn't be useful in trying to pinpoint any particular area where there's uh an issue do you know for how long was it collected i i if you look um the report you have a copy of the report i left mine in the other room but it has uh the number of years i'll look at it it has it and i'm sorry i just no that's okay i'll look at it i know we're rushing it's a phenomenon day the other question i have if i may mr chairman is regarding medicaid the evidence the numbers were collecting medicaid presently do you know if anything is being done with that data uh no no i i do i do not any programs have come out of that well i i really do not know thank you so much i appreciate it thank you thank you thank you mr chairman thank you very much thank you where would you like to begin please sure thank you mr chairman members of the committee my name is jeffrey meister i'm testifying on behalf of maryland right to life you've heard about the need to measure the abortion rate before how will be helpful in verifying the effectiveness of different programs the state has we heard that in references to seminal legislation last year regarding the family planning works act the sponsor mentioned quite a bit about that but it's important that we verify the effectiveness of that the law could be the most effective we've ever seen the least effective but we just have no way of knowing so we wouldn't be able to adjust it if necessary uh it is an important claim again but we have no way of evaluating this or any other program that we currently have in the state of maryland regarding unplanned pregnancy and preventing unwanted pregnancy similarly the governor's office of children youth and families has publicly admitted that they have no idea what the teen abortion rate is and they're right all that's measured is a team birth rate that's helpful but the number of pregnancies is the sum of the teen birth rate plus miscarriages plus abortion so how can we impact the teen pregnancy rate in trying to lower that uh if we don't know what the teen pregnancy rate actually is if we don't know how many teen abortions occur we're missing that significant piece of the puzzle uh i think that we can all acknowledge that trying to reduce the teen pregnancy rate is a very laudable goal but currently we're working in the dark and trying to figure out an effective approach for doing so uh confidentiality as the sponsor mentioned has always been an important piece of this issue the bill has been revised based on concerns that we heard last year the section uh on why women chose abortion has been completely eliminated from the bill that's not in this bill we still feel that it could be important data to collect but the bill is presented as an important compromise and a reasonable compromise that we should be able to support i encourage each of you to give the bill a careful reading there are numerous places where where it is emphasized that the data is going to be confidential but the name of the patient is prohibited from appearing anywhere on any of the forms as it should be the bill has a five five thousand dollar penalty for anyone who violates confidentiality let it be clear we want to protect patient confidentiality with this bill the bill calls for three different reports the first report contains demographic information about abortion seen only by dhmh it is sent by abortion providers the dhmh and will never be a public record the second report is again information seen only by dhmh and it only deals with information in those instances where there are complications dhmh uses these two confidential reports to compile a statistical summary and is this summary uh that's similar uh to what was included i believe with the maryland catholic conference testimony today if you take a look at that there are no patient names there are no physician names and there are no facility medical facility names either there are only summary statistics that will be available to the public the data is important for women's health because it will help efforts to help women most at risk for unplanned pregnancy that's one of the many reasons why the u s center for disease control recommends collecting the data which i further expand upon in my written testimony taken directly from their statements and it's also why 46 other states currently collect this confidential data we urge a favorable report and thank you thank you mr chairman i'm nancy peltow with the maryland catholic conference and this testimony in support of hb 967 is offered on behalf of the catholic bishops serving maryland we are often asked why do you want this data but i think the more important question is why should you want this data i've known many of you for several years a lot of you know i have a phd in analytical chemistry that's also known as measurement science you need data to solve problems and we need to collect this data this abortion data to solve some of the public policy problems that we're dealing with we don't know how many 12-year-olds had abortions last year we don't know if they were investigative statutory rape abortion erases evidence of this crime so as public policy makers i would hope that you would want to have this data to protect these kids we don't know how many abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy are occurring we do know that leroy carhart flies in once a week to perform abortions estimates are that he's aborting approximately 500 viable babies each year if this is true and that's just for one clinic i think we need to understand how we can help these women understand that they have other choices you've heard reference to the report that the department of health used to publish it is attached to my testimony so as you look at that report one of the things that might jump out is that according to that data 70 percent of abortions in maryland are repeat abortions women having three four or more abortions this is known to damage it can damage the cervix and that can make it difficult to carry a pregnancy to term which can lead to a preterm delivery or low birth weight baby the state wants to prevent these preterm deliveries and these low birth weight babies so we should want to collect this data you can't solve problems if you don't have data infant mortality i'd like to spend my last bit of my testimony talking about that this is an important issue in maryland but you're not looking at all the contributing factors the leading cause of infant mortality is a preterm delivery or low birth weight baby and it's very well documented in the medical literature but having one or more abortions increases your risk of having a preterm delivery or low birth weight baby see the another attachment to my testimony i have summarized 59 studies 59 studies that saw a significant correlation between one or more abortions and having a preterm delivery or low birth weight infants these are not pro-life journals these are the journal of the american medical association the new england journal of medicine this is not pro-life propaganda this is scientific information that you as policymakers can't afford to ignore we need to understand what are the correlations between a late term abortion and infant mortality what's the correlation between repeat abortions and infant mortality we need to analyze the data so why do we want this data i i'm a little appalled at the department's testimony they would say there's no public policy reason for collecting this you don't know what the problems are unless you're collecting the data we should analyze the data and see if some of this data holds the key to the infant mortality rate but first we have to collect the data what is to fear from collecting this data if we're protecting patient confidentiality why would you not want it especially when 46 states use it to promote health i'll just close by saying we need this data to solve public policy issues to understand the public policy issues i think it's a disservice to women to not collect this data and i would urge a favorable report thank you hi my name is stephanie white i live in the 46th district and i'm here today because abortion has ever changed my life my daughter was murdered by her doctor given too much medication and uh the abortion was was complete but afterwards what he had done killed her with the anesthesia anesthesia um i i'm for this bill because would it help my daughter no she's gone but all the women that i talk to about abortions and talk and they tell me their stories if in some way in taking this data would help to stop or lessen or make things more uh possible for women to to not have unwanted pregnancies no my daughter didn't want her child because her first child had a disability so therefore she found herself going to get abortion it was a law that gives her the right to make a choice i couldn't change her mind i didn't know about it but you know if she had had uh the statistics maybe she would have known that there wasn't a place to be maybe she could have known it was another choice she could have taken other than to go into a place that was going to take her our ultimate take her life so i don't know um what else to be done but if you do take the data the data will speak for itself because you won't even have to to do a lot of reports because as you read the data it will let you know exactly where the problem is what the problem is and what you can do i personally know of women that have had nine abortions they are using it as a way of birth control and that's an epidemic and we don't know about it because nobody's taking the information nobody's taking the time to compile the data so that it can speak for itself believe me once you take that data no one of a higher education would have to read anyone could read it and it would tell the story of what is going on with our youth and our women and our older women because abortion has nothing to do with age race or religion anyone who wants to take have an abortion and when those private facilities know that everything that they go there to do will be kept secret so therefore they can continue to do it over and over and over so i just believe that if we get a favor report that we take the statistics let the statistics speak for itself thank you for letting me speak thank you questions for this panel uh let's begin with delegate frank the delegate thank you mr chairman uh nancy you mentioned that um it's estimated that about 70 percent of abortions in maryland are repeat abortions yes sir do we know um for the medicaid funded abortions does dhmh have any statistics on how many of them are repeat abortions from what i've seen of the medicaid data it's very sparse so they're collecting some demographics some basic information but i don't know if they're collecting information whether it's a second third or fourth abortion okay it's going to follow up and if there was any programs in place that dhmh has to i mean obviously someone a woman having three four five abortions over over and over again there's there's definitely a problem there are you familiar with any programs at the hmh that seeks to address this problem i am not familiar with those no thank you for mrs patel miss patel how long has medicaid been collecting the data i'm not sure of the numbers um they collected because it's the only way to reimburse the doctors right but how long has it been done i do not know the answer to that and do you know in maryland we actually collect the data because we have people on medicaid correct correct um do you know if any programs have come out of that data not to my knowledge no thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you i'll go um good afternoon my name is jody finkelstein i'm the executive director of nero pro choice maryland and it's certainly a pleasure to be here today i am testifying in opposition to house bill 967 um house bill 967 it's actually a targeted regulation of abortion providers and it's a bill truly designed to increase the cost and limit the accessibility of abortions in maryland generally these kinds of laws are burdensome restrictions not applied to other health care providers or medical professionals these restrictions can be administrative physical personal or have other kinds of personnel i'm sorry or other kinds of requirements no other physician is compelled to give such a detailed report for any other medical service provided in maryland by not requiring other health care providers to adhere to similar reporting requirements the bill is unjustly placing intrusive reporting conditions solely on abortion providers narrow process maryland obviously excuse me opposes this bill for this reason and several other reasons that my colleagues will address thank you i'm robin elliott i'm here today on behalf of planned parenthood of maryland in opposition to the bill first i wanted to thank delegate catch i think he's maybe gone back to subcommittee but i did want to thank him for including a provision that would place a fairly hefty penalty on revealing confidentiality information and we do appreciate that they're just a couple points i'd like to make first planned parenthood of maryland is very concerned about this bill because we believe asking these questions and knowing that this information will be going to the state can be intimidating to our patients um it's it's not fortunately that the typical medical service our patients often have to go through lines of people protesting it is already an intimidating situation the second main point i'd like to bring up is that this type of reporting we believe can be disruptive to the patient physician relationship that patients when they know this information is going to be reported to the state may be less likely to disclose the real truth to their providers so it could be the question of whether or not they're married their single prior pregnancies all of that information is the most important person to have it is the physician so that the physician can make medical judgments you're also going to hear today from my colleagues to the right about several concerns we have in terms of inadvertently setting up situations where there could be information revealed about providers and as you can imagine we're very sensitive to making sure that our providers are protected our individual physician names are not revealed thank you very much and i i had one i did want to answer delegate um krebs's question i think on medicaid the and i i think delegate pena malnick alluded to it the information that medicaid collects is encounter data so it's its claims data it does not have the the demographic components that um this bill would be collecting so it would be an additional um sort of system that would have to be put in place thank you very much thank you mr chairman my name is stephen whiting representing the aclu of maryland today the aclu of maryland strongly opposes hb 967 as a dangerous attempt to limit women's access to vital reproductive health services and wrongly target abortion providers hb 967 which requires a physician who performs an abortion in the state to report the abortion to the department of health and mental hygiene is an invasion of privacy and places patients and medical professionals at risk of harm while the bill does not require the identification of any patient if a woman knows that her abortion will be reported it will have a chilling effect on women seeking abortions hb 967 also places medical personnel and at risk of harassment and violence as you heard earlier with mention of dr george tiller in the in putting patients at risk while the names of the women are not to be reported providers are to report any abortions they perform as well as any complications or injuries involved in a woman's procedure there is enough information required to be reported that someone could determine the identity of the women putting them at risk of harassment and violence and these are not simply theoretical risks john ashcroft as u s attorney general sought the medical records of women who had abortions indiana's attorney general also attempted to seize medical records of young women seeking abortions from reproductive health clinics phil klein while attorney general of kansas subpoenaed the medical records of women seeking abortions and planned parenthood later sued klein for disclosing material that had been sealed by the court the the department's gathering of this information is an open invitation to abuse and jeopardizes patience and to abuse i'm sorry and jeopardizes patients and doctors and we urge an unfavorable report thank you good afternoon mr chairman members of the committee my name is laurie ruth i'm the legal director at the women's law center of maryland we are a non-profit member-based organization that seeks to protect the rights of women and children in the state of maryland we also oppose this bill an urgent unfavorable report i just want to emphasize what my colleague at the aclu has said about the ability to get this information and you know we talk a lot in life about unintended consequences and uh even if you believe which i don't necessarily that this is not an attempt to chill abortion access in this state the possibility of this information getting out to the grave danger of some of these patients and some of these providers is very real as my colleague from the aclu said and there is an explicit ability in the statute for law enforcement to obtain this information by court order and that concerns us very very much at the women's law center so we urge an unfavorable report thank you thank you mr chairman just uh two quick questions for the representative from aclu why did um it's it's not a it's not um i haven't heard john ashcroft's name in a while uh it's uh you know why did why did he or these other attorney generals subpoena that information and where did they subpoena it from um and i do not have the direct information in front of me unfortunately so i cannot give you uh give you a true answer to that but the um the information was uh directly related to whether or not providers were following the reporting requirements in these states so by by having these bills in place and these laws in place they they were trying to determine on they were trying to enforce the law but some would say a phishing expedition they did try and uh obtain this record these records so they tried to attain the records to see if those providers were complying with the law not because they were trying to find out which women had had an abortion or or am i wrong about that some would say that it would that would that it was a fishing expedition rather okay okay and then um i actually would really be curious if you have that information in all seriousness i'd like to know about it i mean if you could get that to me i would appreciate it see the links in our written testament oh okay great i'll check that out um and then the other question i have is just i guess for me do we anybody can answer this on the panel but i don't understand how i'm confused is how recording medical data with that's faceless and nameless could lead us to a chilling effect i mean do we record a lot of other there's a lot of other medical data that gets reported we just had a whole a whole series of of hearings on legislation about stent overuse now granted that's not as much of a privacy issue as as as someone who has a terminated pregnancy and i recognize that but i'm just i'm hoping maybe somebody can comment i don't really get how how we already i mean what's more likely is for someone who uses who is is poor maybe not as well educated they already we already know the medicaid statistics so we already are finding out about those folks i would think those folks would be more likely to be intimidated than someone who is maybe better off and can afford to go or has a plan that can help them go to get an abortion through private means so how how can we how is this going to chill how is it going to work just so i'm happy to answer that so when we look at issues of health information exchanges it's a very good question um and it comes up a lot in front of this committee what is key is for the patient to be able to opt out of their information being reported to whether it's the health information exchange i think you might be hearing about some other types of initiatives similar to that when looking at patient-centered medical homes and so forth so this is mandatory so all the patient's information would be reported without their consent to the department having their their stent procedure be reported right now i luckily am not familiar with this i'm not trying to push i'm not trying to confront you i just because maybe that's you know maybe that's a compromise i mean you know where if someone would really like to opt out maybe they can i mean um it's not my bill so i'm not in a position to accept or offer memphis but um i mean i i would be curious that's a question i'm curious about and and if someone can't opt out i mean can people opt out of these other reporting requirements so i guess i'm just rhetorically throwing that out there thank you thank you you were talking about the bill and the certain requirements in the bill do other states have lesser requirements or different reporting requirements and are there any states that we could look to that you would be okay with the reporting requirements just to get the information like we're trying to get um the states are really uh varied in terms of their reporting requirements um uh they all report numbers of abortions the ones that collect the information of course but in terms of the different components of this particular bill some of them have same components some of them have less some of them have additional components our our position is that we think that it does have a chilling effect upon women knowing that this data is being reported having having opt-out provisions related to health information exchanges or other similar types of policies has always been the position of planned parenthood so in this case we're being very consistent that we don't want mandatory um reporting we we also do think it um knowing that you're having a conversation with your physician even about fairly mundane things about whether or not you eat too much all of those things i think we all have a tendency a little bit to not report quite as truthfully and in this situation knowing how sensitive this information is and the knowledge that it is going to be sent to the state there are important medical questions that have to be asked about pregnancy history and we are very concerned that women might not be as truthful as they would be had if they knew this information was being reported well in the other states that report it are they all also anonymous they don't have names attached to them i mean that to me is the key i mean if somebody's not just going to report statistics versus i certainly would not want my name attached either but that's not what this is and i don't know if the other states if that makes a difference or not these are clearly just you know i would think a form that's filled out that says these are the items that you have to fill out i don't i would not think of that as being the same but do any other states have to be under anything other than i'm not sure about the names um i'll i can check that would make a huge difference it really it really is it really is varied i think i just read an article today about tennessee that their general assembly was proposing that they wanted to publicize everything and so that's obviously not something that we would understand right right so they do vary but we we're i'm happy to work the panel's happy to work to see if we can get some additional information well here's one of my frustrations with this issue and it's obviously so polarizing you know i even read the testimony you talk about extremists that are you know anti-choice extremists and they would say you know pro-choice extremists and some of us are there for public health and we did talk a little bit about some of the reasons that this could be helpful information on one health disparities or um lots of things and we'll have to go through that and last year's bill planned parenthood the name of planned parenthood is planned parenthood and i guess we're trying to get people to have more of that versus unplanned parenthood or whatever so how do we ever get common ground to do like last year's bill i wish we'd put this bill in last year's bill that we supported to try to help reduce unwanted pregnancies um that we would have the statistics to show if it worked because we as it's been stated by the sponsor we don't have the statistics and if we do think it works we have no way to show it to expand the program and it was done for many reasons with the bill last year we were told economics i mean we're going to save 26 million dollars by spending two when unwounded pregnancy so just from a fiscal point of view we could spend that on something else and i think we all agree that there's many other advantages so how do we ever come to a com a middle ground without having you know this group say oh you're taking away choice and this group say everything you know how do we ever just come to good public policy without having some compromise on what is reasonable to address some of these other issues and they do 46 other states and i don't know what they use it for and if they're using it to help some of the outcomes but how do we ever move forward without being black and white when something as simple as anonymous reporting that that is a very good question i think there's a difference between reporting information and public health research so for instance i know when gupmaker does its surveys of states which they do every two to three years depending on their funding and um they actually as my understanding is sometimes their numbers are a little bit higher than states that are mandated to report um probably because um providers know group marker and are more comfortable talking to them guttmacher also looks at unintended pregnancies they look at how many pregnancies result in birth so they look at the entire package and that is a public health survey data that has i'm not an epidemiologist but it has more of a statistical validity i think pure reporting data well it may be interesting might not necessarily get to some of the real public health questions that this committee has rightfully posed how do they get their information how does guttmacher get their information i mean it's voluntary how do they get it how do we even know if it's good data my understanding is in terms of the the provider part is they survey providers um they ask them questions they also look at the other kind of public health components about how many women have unintended pregnancies because that's a big piece you have you have abortion but you also have i think delegate moreheim raised there could be things that we don't think of as abortion but spontaneous abortions things like that some women don't even necessarily know that they're pregnant early on and there's a spontaneous abortion without them knowing it we have to look at pregnancy rates so it's an entire package of information and so one of the challenges with just picking out one piece of information and reporting it doesn't have the whole picture so i i think in terms of i i do believe that there is common ground in having an interest in looking at this topic and looking at the public health research behind it um where providers are uncomfortable is mandatory reporting and that is very much because it's the report puts the requirement between themselves and the patient and it's not it's not a stent procedure it's not any other type of procedure that we normally talk about it is highly polarized so we think that's uh patients are and providers are more far more sensitive to collecting this type of information than they may be somebody i mean i just i just wish that there could be some medium ground middle ground because collecting data to try to take care of some of these issues i think would be helpful and when i hear the good locker this data and there seems to be there could be some correlation with some of these other issues and it'd be nice to get to the bottom of it i would i would hope all of the groups could get together and agree that there are certain things we agree upon and that is that we want to reduce unwanted pregnancies we spent two million dollars last year we all agreed that that was a good investment so i i just wish that we could get um find some happy medium of weight way to quantify this stuff so that we would feel good about investing more money if we see we're never going to know if that money as wade said delegate uh catch said um if that money has been a good investment if we don't have any data to support it except anecdotally thank you thank you mr chair um i have to start my questions by emphasizing that i don't mean in any way to trivialize this issue so i just you know i'm gonna start that way but um would and i'm gonna i'm gonna start with miss ficklestein um would you agree that uh an abortion is an elective medical procedure i think as an elected medical procedure that's an interesting way of looking at it i think that is a it's a reproductive health option for a woman who is facing an unintended pregnancy but that she has made that choice elected to do it as a person although there are certain circumstances and with the life of the mother that she may not necessarily have that choice right but i'm i'm talking about the the bigger scope which is what i think where the concern lies okay so um would you agree then that in sense it is a personal choice that this woman has made probably with a lot of thinking absolutely and heart and soul-wrenching um you know to to have to make this decision that the stigma you know given the decision that went through it the stigma might be the result of that very difficult decision making in addition to the sociological um conflict that we have here in america absolutely i mean so i'm just verifying and affirming this stigma you know around what the reporting is we don't report other elective kinds of procedures you know i think a stent is um you know that's not elective most of the time i mean it's never elective really they do it only because they need to right um i don't know how many facelifts are done i personally oppose facelifts but you know we don't want to capture that and i bet you a lot of men and women don't want to tell that they've had a face left but um so that's the non-trivial part so i'm going to go to you miss ellie um i mean we heard earlier that there's a lot of data collected already on our medical procedures stents have been mentioned a few times i happen to know that in this context it's been the result of a research study that we've been you know collecting this data so from your your knowledge does dhmh collect any other data like this they do not they have in their statute provisions to collect data on its infectious diseases and i think that dates way back to actually when public health started so they tend to collect data on or they're statutorily required to collect data when there's an infectious disease in which there is an immediate intervention i guess that's needed okay chairman thank you um just following up on delegate krebs excellent question about trying to find common ground i mean you clearly made it very obvious that you opposed the bill i respect that is there any way that the bill could be paired back or scaled back that you would find it to be acceptable for example what if we just collected the numbers of abortions and some basic demographic information and kept in the bill the five thousand dollar penalty for violating the confidentiality of the of the the issue is there any way that you can support a scaled backed version of the bill that would provide to dhmh and others some basic public health information that i think would be beneficial to the citizens of maryland is there any way you could support and scale that bill delegate frank i appreciate the question and i i think that our discomfort is with the idea of mandated reporting even if the number of data fields are less and that's very much because our patients we know are very sensitive about this particular issue and they we do not believe they want to share this information with the state um and so there isn't i would love to be able to tell you there's a compromise and to pass a bill and maybe move on to the next thing but this is something that um we fundamentally have concerns with the the idea of mandated reporting do you think there's any benefit or usefulness to know for example how many abortions are performed in the state every year is that is that something we should know we we think there's definitely a benefit to know the whole entire context of maternal and child health which is looking at rates of unintended pregnancies it's looking at on how many pregnancies actually go forward and happen how many may end not abortions but in for other reasons so we don't think that this is the vehicle to capture that fraud information thank you very much tell afternoon colleagues it was a great pleasure to bring house bill 1026 for delegate veronica turner uh this bill establishes sickle cell disease research program and sickle cell disease research fund a special non-lapsing fund to provide grants and loans to public private entities in state uh for development of cures for sickle cell disease using bone marrow and un umbilical cord blood the bill requires the maryland uh technology development corporation tedco to administer the program in the fund uh tedco must establish competitive application process as well as a criteria and procedures for awarding grants from this fund currently the only cure for sickle cell disease uses stem cells from either the bone marrow or umbilical cords uh hb 1026 will allow the maryland or tetco uh to receive additional money uh and so the thing is this is one of those diseases that costs to stay a whole lot of money and there are some uh cures out there and one of them is amazing is with the umbilical cord as far as being able to find some cures and save the state some money so at this time i could turn over to uh dr patel to let her finish up and we're going to show you a short short video here i know how they feel i really do sickle cell anemia is a very devastating and painful disease it's a disease in which red blood cells are not normal the red blood cells necessary to carry oxygen throughout the body would not provide that care for your body when i first found out that joseph had sickle cell anemia i was like okay it can be the worst so it can be the best case scenario well in his eighth month all of a sudden there was a noticeable change in our son uh we noticed his hands and feet had swollen and he was not the playful baby he just didn't want to be moved so and when you touched him he just screamed in pain [Applause] [Music] you know the doctor came and told us personally he said that joseph may not live very long with the amount of crises he's been having you know he might not even make it to his teenage years the study that i had gone through said there is no cure for sickle cell anemia and but he came and said there was a option a cure which was stem cell transplant so we on a worldwide search for his blood typing to make sure that we can find a match for him but being african-american made that difficult and you know we never did find that match so uh one thing i could do now is pray and i pray don't believe me i pray and then i get pregnant i knew that we would have the umbilical cord blood stem cell that could save joseph's life so the first step is try to find out it was a match i had the faction report to joseph doctor and they called me back within 10 minutes [Music] and they told me it was a perfect match [Music] he said six out of six it's a miracle i said i know so once he did his chemotherapy about 10 days he'll be able to take the cells that we got from his brother they brought the sample back and they just injected it and it was just as simple as can be they just squirted it in and that was it and after then his cells did not reject these cells coming in he just became actually a normal baby his red blood cells now were normal and not sickle cells never ever had a sickle cell crisis again my name is joseph davis adult stem cells from my brothers saved my life [Applause] thank you mr chairman members of the committee i'm nancy peltow with the maryland catholic conference and this testimony in support of hb 1026 suffered on behalf of the catholic bishop serving maryland the reason we're bringing this bill this bill is very important for two main reasons first of all we have been very close to a cure for sickle cell disease for over two decades it's time to put this suffering behind us the second reason is the economic impact that passing this bill will have is going to be a very very large economic impact for the state of maryland when i was um meeting with the staff at saint agnes hospital to encourage them to start a cord blood collection program one of the doctors there said to me why doesn't the public know that a cord blood transplant is a cure for sickle cell disease and then when i went to johns hopkins uh university and i met with dr me to talk about the current clinical trial he's doing using bone marrow transplants transplants to cure sickle cell disease he said something very similar why don't parents know that you have a 90 chance of curing a child with sickle cell disease with a bone marrow transplant this bill seeks to build on research that is already curing patients it's very highly focused on taking what's already working in the experimental phase it's working with some patients and let's figure out how to make sure that it works for all patients the first bone marrow transplant to treat sickle cell disease happened 24 years ago the first cord blood transplant to treat sickle cell disease with an unrelated donor happened 14 years ago why is this still in the experimental stages let me give you some cost examples we have about 1700 children in the state of maryland currently suffering from sickle cell disease the average cost when you average medicaid costs in with private insurance costs is about 13 000 dollars that it costs our health care system each year just to treat the symptoms not a cure but just to treat the pain crises that's 22 million dollars a year this is costing for the children in maryland let's talk about one child with sickle cell disease the medicaid cost to treat the symptoms for one child with sickle cell disease is twelve thousand dollars a year if that person is lucky enough to live as long as fifty years that's over the lifetime it costs us six hundred thousand dollars in medicaid dollars just to treat symptoms if every child who was diagnosed with sickle cell disease could get a transplant we would have no adults with sickle cell disease let me just directly address the fiscal notes i was a little surprised to see the five hundred thousand dollar stickle now excuse me fiscal note because the bill specifically gives the governor discretion to fund this program at the level as he sees fit i do know that delegate trent has started conversations with the governor we were thinking more like two hundred thousand dollars would be good seed money to get the program started but i do understand the five hundred thousand dollars is kind of a default number um to quote-unquote capitalize the funds but let's just take a hypothetical if we spend five hundred thousand dollars in one year to get this program off the ground and we do bone marrow transplants on fifty children the first year there's a ninety percent chance that we're going to cure sickle cell disease in those kids so 45 of them were cured over the short term in one year forty five kids times twelve thousand dollars that's a savings of five hundred and forty thousand dollars for one year that they go without having to have sickle cell disease treatment long term if you look at the lifetime of these 45 people 540 000 times 50 years is 27 million dollars we would save by not having to treat the symptoms of these 50 kids with sickle cell disease that's not even counting with adults lost work time the time of caregivers to take care of these folks i'll just close with um from an economic development standpoint i think this is a huge opportunity for maryland to really jump out in front and be a leader there are pockets of sickle cell disease research going on all over the country but we do have two clinical trials going on right here in maryland right now at nih and at hopkins if maryland would be known for the place where a routine cure for sickle cell disease was developed i think that would be amazing for the state it fits in well with the governor's plan to have maryland be a biotechnology leader and i just want to close by saying i have spoken to mr rob rosenbaum the head of tedco had a conversation with him about a year ago and he said as long as the program would be new money which is what we've asked the governor for we're not going to cannibalize any of tedco's other programs but mr rosenbaum said as long as it's new money that quote we'd be happy to run the program for you and you get the same level of excellent service as the fine ted co programs in existence now i urge a favorable report thank you are there any questions thank you very much if i might make sure thank you uh chairman have to make this comment to the committee uh this is one of the bills that uh actually look to save the state a tremendous amount of money uh i wrote a letter to the governor and said that this is not my bill this is doug ivanka's turn to bill i'm on this bill but the more you read about uh another person's uh efforts they're trying to do the more you become attached so i did write a letter to governor martin o'malley and i ask that if he'd be willing to provide two hundred thousand dollars seed money to get this going as we all know in this room that's less than what we take back in bond bill money i mean to build a rec center or something like that this talking about saving people's lives just to get started this is going to help as far as uh collaborating with outside uh grants and other researchers to be able to get this program off the ground so uh i would urge all of you uh to think hard and deep about this and see what we can do uh to encourage uh the governor and others uh to look for this small seed money of two hundred thousand dollars uh in our general fund but thank you so much for your time thank you very much thank you let's bring up by gladys arrington lachanda green and nikki peterson william forbes um um i'll go first my name is lashanda green and i have sickle cell um had sickle cell you know all my life and i think we shared more money and research because it's not enough people that know about the disease um i had grown up due to hospitalization surgeries and just not being able to do what a normal person does i have two kids and when i have to go in the hospital i have to leave them months at a time which puts a strain on me and them [Music] and my name is nikki peterson i live here in the state of maryland and i also have sickle cell unfortunately my friend william is not here to be with us today because he is in the hospital i have what they call hemoglobin ss and i'm 38 years old and i'm so blessed to be 38 because i never in my life that i would see 38. i'll be 39 in a couple of weeks lord willing i have had four strokes i do not know what it means to be without pain that's a concept i do not understand i wake up in pain i go to bed in pain i live my day in pain a good day for me is to wake up thank god that i saw another day and i know my name i know what today's date is i take my first dosage of pain medication i take oxycontin every 12 hours long acting and i take a short acting every four hours on a good day i can take my my long acting every 12 hours me my short acting once or twice on a normal day i take about i take my short acting every four hours on a day where i need extra help there are only two places in maryland that treat sickle cell pain that we can go and get iv fluids and pain medication we need it that's johns hopkins and a private doctor's office in greenbelt maryland there are days where i have to be hospitalized i don't know what it means to be normal i have a high school diploma and a college degree and i'm not able to work in the field that i love because of my illness i had to retire out of the school system in 2002 because i got sick and had a crisis in my back and cracked four vertebras i have four compression fractures in my back because of my strokes i've had to start all over my life twice i don't have any childhood memories from 11 on down and my last stroke that i had my friend will every day he would introduce himself to me and tell me my name and tell me everybody in the room every 10 minutes he would do that he would say your name is nikki my name is will this is so-and-so and so-and-so the reason why this bill is important is so that other children will not have to struggle the way that we have to every day the hardest thing for us is when we go into the emergency room and deal with doctors and nurses who treat us like second-class citizens because they don't understand what we go through on a normal day sickle cell is an in is an invisible disease you can't see my pain you can't even take a blood test to tell me whether i'm in pain or not you have to take my word for it and if you don't believe me then you won't treat me the way that i need to be treated and we deal with that this bill is important so that children won't have to deal with that and parents won't have to know that their children are suffering that's why this bill is important okay are there any questions for this panel thank you very much for your time and your testimony here today we do appreciate it thank you bring up dan ginsel mr chairman and members of the community uh first i want to make it clear i am not against stem cell research on sickle cell anemia i'm here on a two front basically one is representing tedco and the other one is representing the maryland stem cell research commission just for the record my position is on the director of the maryland stem cell research fund so i want to just say two words on behalf of tedco how pleased we are that the legislators continue to see our organization as the proper administrator of entity for any technology and research based fund and we will continue to do everything in our power through dedication integrity and professionalism to justify this trust now we've heard the testimony before you have the written testimony that basically specified four points why we think that it is not really necessary to create this i can basically summarize them very quickly one is the focus of the bill which is only to research using adult stem cells or blood core stem cells there are other research there is small molecules there is antibody there is a different biologics there are different other treatments that currently in research there is actually a company in rockville maryland called glycomics that have a phase two clinical trial with the fda for a small molecule to treat sickle cell they were devastated that if this fund will create that they won't be able to apply and use some of the money to to bring treatment second is current research funded currently the maryland stencil research fund over the past five years supports nine different research applications on adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells to treat sickle cell anemia if you go into the federal report system you can find another 21 research fund projects funded by the nih to treat and to the symptoms or the actual disease of sickle cell anemia if the boon if the bill will to move forward i think that would bring a lot of other interest groups that would want to see special funds to support parkinson to support alzheimer to support cancer to support any disease that is devastating and needs more money for research and we do need more money for research and the problem is that that would bring the cost to administer so many different funds and i think that was what was smart about creating one centralized stem cell fund that can support all different diseases all different conditions and provide the best cost to administer all those program the other one is that we might be in a situation when we dedicate a certain amount of money that we're actually going to fund poor scientifically merit research because now we are dedicated to submit one and we might not receive good applications now those are the points but i actually want to address the issues that were here before and and sickle cell is a devastating disease but what i heard is two major problem that i don't think this fund is going to solve one is the diagnostic of the disease and the other one is the awareness that's what we need to solve and i offered in many conversations some with legislators here and some with people who testified i think that the state needs to have some kind of a diagnostic pre-marital diagnostic for free to allow people to see whether they're carrying the mutation maybe they carry it to make them to let them make an educated decision if they want to if they choose to bring children maybe to identify and let them see if they can store their stencil when they choose to have kids i think that is what the state needs to do to help us solve this problem not to create another fund that basically gonna duplicate what we're already doing thank you five years how many grants have you given for sickle cell anemia nine grants nine grants and uh and and uh for what amounts would you say they were they vary from uh fellow postdoc fellowship grants for a hundred thousand dollars up to uh investigate initiated grants that went up to a million and more do those grants go to institutions here in maryland they went to institutions in maryland from university of maryland johns hopkins and private companies were they um adult stem cell grants or what were they some were adult and some were embryonic and if i'm not mistaken there is one which isn't on core blood stem cells how much in the way of embryonic grants are you giving a lot i'm not sure i i i i'm not sure i don't want to speculate on how many of those were embryonic versus adults well well maybe i'll put a little different how many uh based on uh embryonic and adults stem cells what is the how many do you normally give it's a ratio of how many that you give out in either one of those uh either embryonic or stem or adult and grants those nine grands no overall a bro overall about 25 of the maryland stencil research fund went to research that was dealing with embryonic stem cell research all the rest are for different types not embryonic what percentage adult of the 25 is embryonic you can tell me that what percent is uh ago so here comes the definition of what is adult stem cell dull stem cell defined by tissue specific stem cell bone marrow stem cell bone mirror can be divided to hematopoietic stem cell mesenchymal everything that's not embryonic those type of stem cells that could be transitioned into something those are right now in the clinic in experiments are bone marrow and cord blood stem cells i don't know the percentage of bone marrow but i i i assume it was it is probably close to close to 40 50 percent 40 50 percent adult 25 embryonic and the rest are usefully important using the different technique cancer stem cells and and so on thank you thank you mr chairman i'm trying to figure out because um i've heard some conflicting stories from ted cohen from others and from the governor's uh office as well uh when i first started getting onto this bill and looking to be supported with with funds from the general fund i was told by the governor's office that tedco through step to the stem cell research you had existing money uh that could be used so there'd be no need for my bill i said well i mean that's nice to hear but i have this bill i want to make sure that's the case and then you come forward and you say well you don't want the money to be used for sick or sell because it'll open the door for other folks to come in with other diseases like parkinson's disease and so there'll be a piling on effect uh no no that's not what i said i said we don't need to create new funds for every disease not that i don't want to use the money to fund stickers up we do and and we continue to review and secure is one of the actually preferred disease that was funded by the commission okay so how much money have you given you've mentioned to doug elliott as far as uh how many grants you have given what's the total amount of those grants you've given for sickle cell research i i did not count the total amount of money but i as i said we had given nine grants that vary from a hundred thousand dollars to to over a million dollars in in in money per grant so for sick a cell for sickle cell for sick yourself so if we're looking for and and i i guess you're a scientist i am a scientist by training yes okay i'm a businessman by training okay but somebody told me that i could invest two hundred thousand dollars and save lives and save the state millions of dollars a year i would say that'd be a safe bet and we're betting state because we have gambling in maryland now so i'm i'm wondering from you why wouldn't you come here with amendments to make it work since you said you've given sick a cell over a million dollars this legislation is only looking to enable us to go and get more money this the two hundred thousand dollars and then and if you go back to five hundred thousand dollars in the fiscal note that's just seed money it's seed money it's not saying that they're looking to read what tech goes doing and that other people are gonna ask for money and don't start a whole new program this is simply looking to jump start the program and so i'm i'm i'm really confused on how you go about issuing grants if you're willing to issue out over a million dollars for uh this particular issue or that particular issue it relates to sicker cell however we want to put it all under one tent and get started with maybe turn thousand miles per year why would you be opposed to something like that so let me start from the beginning a i am not opposed to stem cell to stem cell research or sickle cell research at all i am actually all for research and i think the state needs to provide more money for research that's one two i disagree with the economic assumption that two hundred thousand dollars would save life because i do not think that the limitation right now on bone marrow transplantation to people with sickle cell is funding the limitation is regulation and regulation is being done in this country by the fda and not by the state and no matter how much money you're going to put that's not going to push the chains of the fda to approve the medical treatment that's something that they do in their own pace and there's nothing that we can do to make it faster do you realize that our secretary dr josh shofstein just left there yes so we do have relationships the fda absolutely okay and so if maryland was to get a leg up and get this program in place i would think we have a pretty good lobbyist uh to help us out as far as pushing the federal government to be able to uh be more forward thinking and it's uh cure or at least more medications to help people with sickle cell disease i mean if the only uh resistance is saying is because the federal government is not moving fast enough or or they haven't approved the certain types of um cures or advances we're looking for uh i just don't see that as a good rationale when we we've already seen that on umbilical cord uh so with the uh the video that we showed it actually it it works and when we're not doing it i agree with you so a i agree with you i wish that the fda was an organization that you can actually lobby it is not but i agree with you that this is the toughest regulatory agency in the world that there is a lot of criticism that sometimes they're too concerned about uh safety and they're not moving progress fast enough i agree with you and i wish that there was a way and and and i wish that uh dr sharpton would be able to to move them fast i don't know if he can i wish he was able to in this disease and many others uh the other issue is again whether we're doing something or not so actually we talked about and you've seen the video the problem was the match of sickle cell to the bone marrow donation right the only institute in the world right now that actually is doing experiment research with non-matching bone marrow treatment for sickle cell is johns hopkins and they've already treated 10 patients with non-matching bone marrow so they're moving in this direction absolutely i i just i wish there is something that i can tell you that we're not doing that we can do more but i i believe that we're doing everything in our power thank you thank you mr chairman it's a follow-up on delegate delegate elliott and delegate to questions you mentioned that there were nine grants that uh you have put forward that have dealt with sickle cell anemia and that um the um the grants have been between a hundred thousand and a million dollars roughly i think that's what you said um can you tell us how many patients have been helped with these grants a number the number of patients helped if i'm not mistaken none of those grant were for clinical trials all those grants were for basic research to find the next treatment so not the treatment that right now is used by bone marrow transplantation but basically for the future treatment that will be available okay thank you i guess hello i know several years ago um doctor i put in a similar bill sickle cell yes and um at the time there was no funding going out to six cell but since that the last two years or more i hear you saying that you put out about nine different rfps out uh award awards so you have nine award because two years ago when we had the bill here we made we probably had one or two yes he had one okay so now you've done it almost 80 percent up from the time that we had the bill um i just the reason i'm asking you this question is because i have been working on sickle cell issues for the last 10 years almost and have worked with um hopkins very closely and i'm a co-sponsor of this bill how and and wants sickle cell to move in a very positive light and um but in doing my research for this legislation and i did address um conversation with dr patel i called dr landscroll at johns hopkins to get a feel as to what is happening in that environment since we set up the the the center for um sickle cell and she informed me that it is um many of those um research is moving in the right direction and um therefore i could not get her to come down to to support this bill okay so um can you elaborate any more about what you've been doing with hopkins so i can't elaborate these awards that have been going to hopkins some of them were to hopkins some of them are for the university of maryland medical school and and as i mentioned some of them are with companies and collaboration between those academic institutes and companies it takes a lot of time to develop a treatment what we're looking are is on treatment that would be new treatment not duplicating what already is done not enough and i admit that's not enough but right now the limitation for bone marrow transplantation in maryland is the number of beds that are available in johns hopkins and umb and the match of the donor to to the uh recipient that's what i get from the two head of the transplant unit it is not the research money it's the regulatory agencies what limits the number of physicians who can provide this service but it's not the lack of of science what we are funding is different science different approach again not using cold blood stem cells or or adult stem cells but using non-matching stem cells using maybe embryonic who knows maybe they're going to be better maybe they're not going to have the immune problems that the adult stem cells have those kind of research is what we found and finally um you may have said it before i walked in the room um how about your stem cell budget has it been cut over the period of time it has been cut drastically yes as your overall stem cell budget remains the same no it has been cut drastically from the peak in 2008 who that was 23 million dollars with the tough economic times we've been cut that we're talking in fiscal year 2013 on 10.4 million dollar okay thank you very much i'm glad we're having this discussion on uh approaches to treating horrible pain a sickle cell in the emergency room where i worked for many years we called it stickered in hell anemia because the patients were so uh such discomfort and having so many complications like strokes and infarctions and i'm i'm wondering uh if you've done any research into the use of marijuana for relieving pain because there's quite a few studies actually that deal with this and i know this committee is very interested in pain relief for patients and i'm wondering if there have been any applications uh for for you for that first i want to say that no i have not done any experiment just for direct i didn't mean you i we did not fund that type of research because we only fund research using human stem cells okay so no we have not okay because it's interesting that all the studies have been done in britain and other countries none of those studies to relieve sickle cell i don't know if we just want to know if you're aware the fact that none of the studies all the extensive studies both in humans and animals have been done in other countries because we aren't able to do that research here unfortunately you're aware of that i'm not aware okay thank you now you can be aware thanks and i got a just a clarifying question for you so are you saying that the 200 000 that we would need to get this program uh off the ground to seed money the 200 000 is not available through tedco at this time that you would not support us being able to have two hundred thousand dollars uh to be used to get this program started because original fiscal notes at five hundred thousand in my letter to the governor i say two hundred thousand so what i'm looking for be straightforward so we don't have anybody being confused can't be being confused i need 200 000 dollars can i have 200 000 a year so first of all i want to be clear we did not write the five hundred thousand dollars fiscal note i know that's a mystery hole back there i know that it is not a number that's coming from us and uh the maryland stem cell research commission opposed very strongly on dedicated amount of money for specific disease type they would like to see the scientific merit of all the applications and see who knows well right now actually you pulled me off to come to this meeting we're right now closed in a room for the next five days to review all the applications to give and who knows maybe we're going to come up with recommendation to fund for 2 million but we refuse or the commission refused to dedicate a certain amount of money for specific disease so so you refuse to do that they refuse to dedicate a certain amount of money for a specific disease they would like to review the application on a scientific merit of each application it might be more it might be less than one year it might be three four times the the amount in another year but they're not willing to dedicate a certain amount of money and if you actually gonna look over the years and let's say that we would have dedicated over the past five years two hundred thousand dollars you would be on the short side because they actually funded much more they funded much more but it wasn't consistent sometimes you go for consistency as old saying a burden a hand is better than two in the bush you you've given me a whole lot of bushes out there i'm i'm a bird in the hand kind of brother so so what i want to say to you is you said you've given uh non-grants before to sick a cell i i would imagine that some of the grants that you've given have been related to this issue have some of the grants the reasons why those grants were actually uh given i would imagine deal with the bill itself as far as with uh stem cell on an umbilical cord a blood cord i can't imagine that somehow some of that money didn't already go to some of the things i have in my legislation is that is that correct you are correct but as i said the commission refused to dedicate a certain amount of money for a specific disease they refused to give a consistent amount to allow us to get maybe 10 times that amount of money consistently you would rather give us that money i disagree with the return on investment number but again they've refused to do it for diabetic research they refused to do it for heart disease they refused to do it for cancer they refused to do it for parkinson we support so many diseases i think when we counted last time we made close to 50 disease and if we start to dedicate each disease specific amount of money we're going to come to a situation where we're now funding poor research instead of funding the best research however you do have history with funding sick a cell research and i assure you that we're going to continue to be committed to fund such important research but we're not going to dedicate amount of money up front before we see the scientific merits but you've already seen the the scientific measure because you've already funded it we fund new applications every year we don't refund the same people we fund new applications every year the applications of people doing similar work we try not to fund the same type of work we try to find innovative new work we're going to meet some more offline i'm not going to take the time of the committee but i thank you for the for your time uh i do appreciate that but we have more work to be done thank you sir i think what's important to understand is when the stem cell bill went in the idea was let the best science prevail let the best science be funded and if you started to dedicate funds for particular diseases you would not have that and as you had in as mr kinsell indicated nine grants have been or applications have been funded for stem cell over the last few years if we were to go down the road of dedicating resources limited resources i would doubt that all nine of those um applications uh or proposals would have been funded and i think that's the point that you're trying to make that should happen yeah okay any additional questions thank you very much for your time and your testimony here today we're going to vote i'm going to say in about five minutes if you want to stretch your legs thank you
-vvEplyvNlI,IN,04-01-2015,if i could have everybody's attention thank you um we're hearing only one bill today but i would definitely plan on uh committee members for a busy week next week we could meet two to three times since we're not meeting money bless you meaning tuesday wednesday potentially thursday we've got a lot of bills to vote on and keep that in mind especially as we talked about in 515 many of you have shared concerns um so i would re-read that bill and pass on your thoughts this week but please plan on next week spending some time in public policy and representative layman has been kind enough not to have insurance so i think we have the room for as long as we need it and i appreciate that so with that dr brown who is the sponsor of senate bill 463 has a very busy schedule today so we want to get right to it and we'll turn it over to dr representative brown welcome thank you chairman dermody i appreciate your indulgence as i running just a little bit late coming from a couple different meetings senate bill 463 comes from senator miller and is regulation of e-cigarettes is the the title uh it also has to do a lot with the attorney general and the tobacco master settlement and some issues related to that i'm just going to go through the summary of the legislation on the fiscal note and again it talks about the qualified escrow fund for tobacco manufacturers and this is to say that cigarettes are exempt from state excise tax if they're sold on federal military installations we have a couple of those in the state the armed the reserve at grissom crane and there's one other i believe it defines the rules of state revenue department to adopt rules to look at the number of units sold by a tobacco product manufacturer and this is related again to the uh to adherence to the tobacco master settlement fund data provision so that there be a clearinghouse for uh quartz arbitrators for the purpose of making calculations for the tobacco master settlement agreement then we get into some of the new uh technology and the new products out there and it will have a provision related to the sale of and distribution of liquid or gel nicotine so it has to be in child resistant packaging and it also requires civil penalties for to destroy products sold distributed in violation of the prohibition of child packaging and also regulates these so that they have a valid tobacco sales certificate related to e-cigarettes and liquid nicotine and gel nicotine and again there's penalties if you don't comply with that that are part of the bill so again that's the essence of the bill i know the attorney general's office is here to to talk about specifics but i'll be happy to entertain questions but it may be the attorney general's office that has much more valuable information than myself and representative brown i know you've got to be on your way with other media other meetings so i appreciate you being here but are there any questions i guess one the child resistant packaging i assume that's where we're getting back into the vape with the liquid or gel yes okay yes again i'm sure you've all heard antidotal accounts of how these things are packaged to where they look like just flavoring to be put on anything and also internet sales where they come in all sorts of packaging they can come in small packages to where you can actually get large gallons of nicotine sold on the internet thank you other questions representative brown for representative brown thank you mr chairman um representative brown do you think you and senator miller miller would be amenable to amending this bill to say that if the riverboats go on land they would have to go smoke free i haven't talked to senator miller about that specific issue i know you have brought it back up to me a couple different times but it is an interesting public policy discussion absolutely so what is your position on that um i had we had the smoke free bill in the public health committee and it was originally drafted that the riverboats and racinos were to be included and i took them out because of the fiscal note implication i think the the fiscal note implication is that it would decrease the revenues from those entities still even though i know illinois has their ban so i'm willing to do that if personally i abhor smoking and we need to control smoking i guess i'm concerned that our revenues in our state are under some stress and pressure but has there been any studies to show that it would be balanced out by the health diminishing of health issues as a result of no smoking excellent point i mean i think the studies are out there definitely on less absenteeism less use of health insurance lower costs to cover health to insure a non-smoker versus a smoker those are dynamic issues and our lsa does not do dynamic scoring as you know and so that has not been calculated into and you did not anticipate this question for me this morning not this one i thought you would ask me about another topic that's kind of circulating around related to this bill why don't you deal with it then thank you representative brown and representative brown you know what i've learned that it's never a a never a good thing when you start out a statement i respect both of you very much but i'm going to say i respect you both very much but uh putting the gaming facilities on land um and making them go non-smoking i think would be a good debate in battle but one i couldn't support um and probably needs to be debated on it on it by itself as opposed to the important issue in this bill i agree thank you um other questions representative brown i know you have to go but thank you and we'll kind of while i have a little bit of time i appreciate it okay um i'd like to hear from some of the vape people first if that's okay and then we'll kind of save the attorney general as well brad kloppenstein vaping community welcome good to see you brad thank you mr kloppenstein one question i mean is this something that is different than the vape bill that there were concerns about uh because i thought there were some concerns in that bill about from the packaging perspective the concerns in the other bill on packaging largely concern the clean room right now as that bill stands thank you any other questions thank you sir sean anderson craven vapes thank you chairman germany is your blue mic on by chance if we could leave that on thank you any questions thank you sir [Music] john mccullough vapor bank thank you chairman members of the committee my name is john mccullough i'm vapor bank in evansville indiana i also own seven liquor stores in evansville indiana also so i'm not a stranger to government regulations in my industry i believe that carefully crafted regulations can protect the consumer while also furthering my industry so i do support the use of child proof caps and i have been using them for over three years i also support the use of tobacco sales certificate i've had those for all three of my retail locations since we opened thank you for hearing my testimony thank you any questions thank you sir and again don't feel the need to repeat uh any of these other people we understand the vape communities in support of it sandy brown and please say your name and where you're from and who you represent okay my name is sandy brown i'm from evansville indiana i own cool breeze vapor we have six stores we have been using the child resistant caps for over two years now so we do support this bill thank you questions thank you sandy then brian mcmahon is it brian i'm sorry uh good morning it's evan mcmahon sorry you must be left-handed my mom said i should have been a doctor with my handwriting um my name is evan mcmahon i'm the owner of liberation vape i'm also the spokesperson for the hoosier vapors council uh the one of the largest advocacy groups for vaping consumers and business owners in the industry we support this bill and i know we've repeated this a couple of times but i'd like to state that the reason why we're supportive of this bill is because these are sensible regulations child proof caps not selling to minors having a certificate from the atc all of these things are very reasonable they're all things that we've all been pushing for the past couple of years to be done adopted anyway you representative germany chairman germany you asked what differences there were with packaging specifically with packaging that we had issues with on the other side most of that actually was on the labeling there were some labeling issues an encryption code that had to be added things like that but as far as the the cap um you know having the tobacco certificate things like that we are 100 in favor of that and encouraging all of our our vape stores that we're in contact with to do that thank you evan any questions amber logdon office of the attorney general hi my name is amber logsdon i do tobacco enforcement for the ag's office this might be the shortest hearing that's happened with regards to the e-cigs but i just want to make myself available for any questions both either on the e-cig piece you know in relation to the other bill or on the msa enforcement pieces so unless no one has questions representative layman thank you mr chairman um sorry i'm fighting a cold here uh two two questions i have one is can you give me an example of where an e-cigarette would be sold today that's not under the tobacco or the the retail licensing um the tobacco sales certificate right now only applies to locations that are selling tobacco products so you know convenience stores um as it stands now if a vape store does not sell any other tobacco products they're not required to obtain a tobacco sales certificate okay i'm just what i'm looking at says that you you cannot sell e-cigarettes unless you have a valid tobacco sales certificate is that correct and that's what this is now that's what we're trying to do yes so my question was where are they being are there somewhere they're being sold now that does not require them to have it yes the vape shops that don't sell any other tobacco okay so they're selling vape and e-cigarettes if i think there's a terminology issue that we run into this that's what i'm after i think there's a we're starting to blur some lines there is an existing definition of electronic cigarette that i think covers the various types that the other bill is you know trying to differentiate a little more between the e-liquid and the you know electronic cigarette as they define it but right now anyone selling an electronics whether it's the e-liquid whether it's you know the vapor pins the ciga-like products if they're only selling those products and not a traditional cigarette or pipe or cigar they don't have they they could probably apply for one but generally they do not have a tobacco sales certificate okay and then one other question just because it was it's referenced in here and that is the master settlement agreement is is there and this doesn't do this filled necessarily but just said my own curiosity is is there an update on where that's continually at is there a report put out every year or i'm just curious where indiana is at on the amount of money that's still in that um well we're i know they put out updates on the money that comes in every april 15th that's something we're still getting information on as soon as we have those firm numbers you know i know our office usually submits something with updates on what those dollars are all right thank you i have one question it seems pretty straightforward but i noticed there were seven votes and i know you've been involved in this the whole way through any reason why the the reason he had seven nay votes on this are coming out of the senate what their reasoning is or if you don't mind sharing please come to the mic if don't both rush some in the senate do not want any regulation at all and so that's the few votes for those that are against any regulation and since there is some even the regulation that they suggest there were some on that that grounds partly so it was that okay thank you uh representative houston for questions um that is and i think that has alarmed some people that is currently already what we're doing is the way we count cigarettes in indiana for the ag's office is by units sold those sales on military installations are already excluded from both the sc this state excise tax and escrow collection when we joined the settlement last year we did broaden the group of cigarettes that we will need to enforce on but we're just maintaining that carve out for those sales so there's no change it's just made more explicit in that definition other questions thank you committee discussion or go ahead representative brown would you like to close because well no i i actually i i can answer representative layman's question if you go to the state board of accounts website under in.gov you can pull up the master tobacco settlement and you can look at how much money has come in and where it's distributed at this time and probably what you're wondering and there's been discussions in representative clare's committee about this over the last couple of years there was a year where the payments were substantially reduced because of non-compliance related to the arbitration hearing uh this summer there was a settlement reached so that those payments weren't restored to the levels prior but the payments were were markedly adjusted up from what the arbitration settlement was the example was for fy14 we only received 67 million as compared to receiving about 129 to 130 million but for 15 were estimated to get 124 million from the tobacco masters on my phone okay other representative layman doc how long is that settlement structured it's structured forever right now is it okay yeah any other questions uh representative brown while we have you on the mic are there any interesting amendments you might be considering thinking about that you and i have maybe talked about that'll stir the pot um there's there's starting to be a little bit more of a grassroots effort to look at cigarette excise tax i think out there the cancer society state medical association hospital association and different people are looking at that one of the things we know as a health care provider if we want indiana to be healthier you know we have to reduce our incidence percentage of cigarette smoking see this is i thought the question you were going to ask representative c brandt and we know that pregnant women especially since the initiative in the house by all house members look at infant mortality and pregnancy pregnant women and teenage smokers are most price sensitive and so you need to continue to look at excise taxes a mechanism to decrease smoking as well as to have smoking bans in place that public policy as well as to have cessation programs available for people to have a healthy healthy citizenry because when you look at states that are healthy and score very high in health indices they have very vigorous programs to make the incidence of smoking much much lower the controversial issue is is you know raising attacks and what that will mean what has happened it was last raised in 2007 representative c brown and myself were involved in a bill it uh related to the initiation of the hip program uh raising the cigarette tax is also much more favorably looked at if it goes to programs goes to cessation goes to mental health goes to addiction services but since 2007 you know as anything you know an eight year time period that increase has been now price desensitized because of the economy and everything else so i think that's why the coalition is looking at that to impact our incidence of smoking and how how does that well number one let me say i'm very interested from the mental health perspective the more money going there i think that's something that i'm interested in but from the second perspective do you know where we are compared to other states with our tax high lows in our surrounding states and we're still below and even uh at 50 cents or even a dollar we still would be below all except kentucky i mean i think it was important to talk about it because we have some strong non-tax increase individuals respectfully and you know to kind of begin thinking about that between now and next week representative houston wow next week okay thank you mr chairman uh chairman brown is uh what's more what's the research show us what's more um of a detriment the cost or the succession programs and actually there probably are some people here that might be more able to answer that question intelligently i mean i think the programs as far as the bands are probably the most most impactful in society and we've done that except for racinos and casinos in certain places if we did a total ban in every public building and some people would like to band you know at public lands i think i guess i don't agree with that approach but bands probably have the most public perception then it's the economics and the cessation is kind of the last part of the whole three-legged stool i'm not sure how we keep going back to bands but uh we're trying to focus on the tax representative lucas thank you mr chairman uh chairman brown if bans are the most effective did i hear you is that correct again i i don't know that in the percentage but i think in the public perception about what you're doing to decrease smoking bans have the most public awareness if pregnant women are one of the biggest problems instead of punishing everybody that smokes through attacks why don't we just make it illegal for pregnant women to smoke good good point i guess uh when i was back in my job of delivering babies i wish i could do that you know because every pregnant woman you know i looked them in the face and you know why are you smoking and do you understand what this does to your baby and you know one of the things they hear out in the public and this is all antidotal is smoking women have smaller babies and you know to a teenage person pregnant you know don't want to have a large baby so they smoke intentionally well i'm not saying smoke intentionally but it's a reason not to quit thank you representative lucas uh representative houston with another question mr chairman i'll steer away from the ban i wouldn't intend to go there anyway but if you if you increase the tax where would you use where would you place that money to not to accelerate the desired intent which you've noted uh you know i think that's a great discussion and i personally don't have any uh predetermination where it has to go and that's always the issue when there's quote a revenue source being looked at there are probably of 150 legislators maybe 350 different ideas where it could go and i certainly could give probably 5 or 10 right off the top of my head our present formula has about 50 going to the state general fund and then the rest divvied up into mental health and community health services and we also have a very small percent going to clean water and things like that i think one of the things chairman dermody would be most interested in is addiction services and i think as we look at what's happened to this state related to scott county you know an addiction being a a focal point of a transmission of a very serious problem in scott county i would say that would need to be on the forefront representative brown thank you mr chairman are our funds still being held up by that arbitration panel that said we didn't pursue the second-tier tobacco companies aggressively enough no again we that was back to the question on tobacco master settlement fund we had a much reduced payment for one year and then over this summer there was a second agreement made between the attorney general's office and the administration and the uh tobacco manufacturers and so we're we're back up we're not back up above where we were or at the level we were before but we are not reduced because that arbitration hearing but are they still auditing the various years there still is in the new agreement the the the enforcement issues we have to enforce those manufacturers who aren't part of the tobacco master settlement fund we have to do that for that i think we we don't have arbitration up until years 2015 or 2014 so the the tobacco manufacturers can start arbitrating going forward with kind of the new agreements in the settlement other questions thank you representative brown i think i'm going to open it up because i'm sure we have some people that would like to speak in this regards anybody like to raise their hand to come speak about this potential consideration i know there's somebody that wants to speak in regards to this i hate to call you out and please state your name and who you represent uh good morning my name is danielle patterson i'm with the american heart association and also with hoosiers for a healthier indiana with regards to the tax the tobacco tax and we do support raising the tax by one dollar what we find is that the tax is one of the most effective ways we can reduce tobacco use in the state people are as you mentioned price sensitive and when you raise the tax by a dollar that helps to change behaviors 25 is not enough because people will will absorb 25 cent in their budget but when you start to look at attack a dollar that's significant enough for people to start changing their behaviors regarding tobacco use and so uh who just for a healthier indiana will support that we also support that if the tax is raised and we do encourage it you're looking at a potential of 240 to 280 million dollars of new revenue coming into the state and we would like a significant share of those dollars to be spent on health programs um indiana has not made a significant investment in public health and this is an opportunity for us to do so and again that is something that hoosiers for a healthier indiana will support we also will support an increase in tobacco prevention and cessation funds at one point the tobacco prevention cessation program was funded at 32 million dollars it is now funded at 5 million dollars well we certainly understand we probably will never get back to the 32 million we certainly would like to see a significant increase in those dollars for cessation and tobacco prevention funds throughout the state and so yes we would be very supportive of increasing the tax thank you danielle any questions representative giaquinta thanks mr chairman where does i know the question i think was asked earlier but where where then does the dollar put us so the dollar will still put us below i mean the dollar will put us above national averages but we will still be low be below our midwest states except for kentucky as you know the governor of ohio already proposed a dollar tax increase for his session this current session um and if that passed that they will still be significantly higher than us we will uh still be below the surrounding states except for kentucky and what's kentucky you know like 60 representative houston thank you mr chairman so i i wasn't kind of prepared to talk about this interesting discussion um we have nothing but time oh good uh in honor i'm asking you as the right person on this but i am struggling a little bit philosophically i'm not a is that you know non-smoker not an advocate for smoking whatsoever but i am stuck on this so we're gonna take 240 280 million dollars in the private sector move it to the governmental sector and then believe that we're going to somehow disburse that so wisely that we're going to get the benefit of of discouraging people from smoking by raising the price and then take money out and bring more money to the government and then we're going to be so smart that we're going to develop these programs they're going to help more people quit smoking too right that's i mean it's largely the arguments being made so why is the public policy why would we raise a tax to bring more money into the government without taking more draconian actions like you know representative lucas said not allowing people to you know pregnant women to smoke or expanding smoking bans i guess i'm wondering why is this just the practical political implication that you're trying to move towards because i will admit i am i give pause to using an economic driver that empowers more government to be the the engine that diminishes anything that we decide that we consider to be a public health issue sure so the cdc has outlined a plan if you want to effectively reduce tobacco control you really should do three things and not just raise the tax although let's just start the tax because we find that it's the best way to reduce tobacco use again when the price raise of when the price of tobacco is increased people will start to you know change their behaviors we saw an increase in 2006 even when we raised the tobacco tax by uh 44 we saw an increase in the cessation quit line program with people deciding you know what it's time for me to start quitting so it's a public health implication that it helps to change the behavior now the second problem we should do is what representative brown said is you know pass a stronger smoke-free law right now we have a great one it's a good start i'm not saying we were totally happy about it but we need to go even a couple of steps further and cover bars and casinos and private clubs i know it's hard for people to swallow but it's the truth then the third thing that we need to do is to invest in robust tobacco prevention cessation programs the tax is not going to solve all the answers but it will help us to start to drive those numbers down when you look at the fact that less than 25 percent of indiana residents smoke you know you and i are not going to feel the burden of it because you know we don't smoke but this will help those people who do smoke help to pay for the costs that their pay for the health care costs that you and i are showing us shouldering the burden of right now we're paying 570 dollars per household to treat tobacco users in this state and that's unfair to the rest of uh indiana residents and i i wouldn't disagree with that at all matter of fact that's why i largely support the and we have pretty selfishly why i would support the uh i'm not interested in doing anything that would encourage smoking um i i guess i'm i'm gonna go back and and say this is the most regressive of taxes is it not well i think if we look at that 25 percent it's it's arguably uh made up of of folks in in the uh um closer to the to the poverty line is that not correct exactly but these are also people that are costing us the most money in terms of what we're paying for health care costs so i would agree with you on that point so shouldn't all the money go into that it would be potentially raised shouldn't all that money go in to reimbursing those of us non-smokers in helping to pay for their health care costs in terms of reducing medicaid costs or something that can be a potential for the dollars as you remember you were not here when we raised the tax back in 2006 like dr brown mentioned that part of the dollars did go to establish the healthy insurance plan and so we have no problems with the dollars going to the healthy indiana plan 2.0 because again people are paying for people that are costing us money are helping to pay those costs or shouldering the burden of those costs in the state for my clarification could you repeat what you said of what it cost every family in indiana and repeat that whole 570 dollars per household based on um oh so it's a calculation that we get from the campaign from for tobacco free kids as well as the american cancer society cancer action network and i don't know the exact formula but i could get that for you hold on bri do you have that related to medicaid related to correct it comes from the american cancer society she can answer that one okay but that related that number comes to what we provide related to medicaid for these individuals that have health related problems due to smoking yes okay representative brown thank you mr chairman and and representative houston i'm falling in love with you aye aye since we have so much time i'd like to hear more about that some some have thrown out suggestions that we not allow pregnant women to smoke i i'd like to know how in the world is that possible i mean do we put a gun to each one of them's head how do we stop pregnant women from smoking well i think that's the interesting point i don't know how you can do that but well go ahead and finish your i would say to representative brown's point while that's a great idea representative houston well that's a separate matter we could discuss that let's stay focused on the bill please but um it would be unfair just to um hold pregnant women accountable i mean because a lot of them live in households where you know maybe the spouse or their partner may also smoke or other family members so if you're gonna pass a law that says you know we want to uh you know find pregnant women guilty or you know something like that then you know just make it for the household because again she has a husband she may have a partner she may live in a household with other people that smoke that also impacts the baby but on the opposite side it would be very hard to unfortunately enforce that how will you afford something like that well i'm interested to just watch representative brown have to decide that of 10 women coming in and we could take a bet how many times he gets slapped uh for deciding who's pregnant and who's not so that might be interesting um representative lucas thank you mr chair i just threw that out there i mean if we're going to have this discussion we have to consider all options and it'll be a relatively easy fix you give them a nicotine test they come in they're pregnant if they're getting taxpayer dollars to pay for their health care you know we have to start protecting the taxpayer on this a little bit because that 560 dollars per household not every household is a net payer of taxes exactly you know that that's a great number to take out and you distribute amongst the large base but when you stop and look at it if you've only got half or less than half of those households are actually paying taxes that number doubles right per taxpayer right now if you've got pregnant women coming in knowing they're pregnant that take the conscientious decision to smoke okay and with all the information that's out there knowing that that is dangerous or they're risking their the lives of their or the health their baby okay you have to look at what cost that is to the people that are actually paying for these services so and you know it's not the health of the mother now we're dealing with with babies that are born prematurely or with greater health needs that are going to be an even greater financial cost to to those few that are paying taxes sure so i mean these are just things that we're discussing and this is part of the discussion that that as members of this committee we have an obligation to consider exactly and i'm not i'm not disappointed and i don't mean to be defensive but i mean yeah if we're going to talk about it let's let's get all of our cards out on the table exactly and actually look at the facts and you know i'm sure it's uncomfortable to have these discussions for some people but uh we're getting to the point of when we're talking hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars uh we have to talk about this thank you representative lucas and as a sidebar representative charlie brown not to put you on the spot but you're intrigued with this and that's an interesting concept that if we are supporting with medicaid dollars and these individuals are having health related issues to smoking and are receiving government support how do you feel i mean is that something that's of interest a nicotine test and i don't think you should hold it just to pregnant women but to anybody that might have a health issue without just hearing other thoughts is that mr chairman this has been a subject matter that i have been involved in for the last 20 or more years that's why i'm a strong advocate for eliminating smoking in public places i think all things should be on the table as it relates to the fact that we the public ultimately pays for much of this uh the health uh needs of these persons that are doing harm to themselves or to their loved ones i can also it's an interesting concept i mean i've we've always talked about the drug testing but it's an interesting concept but i guess representative houston please what i mean your problem is you go down a rat hole are you gonna then alcohol test are you gonna go i mean what what you know somebody does a prescription drug i mean i feel like this is so i i mean i'm gonna lose my i appreciate uh representative brown's comments you know lose his love here because i'm not a i'm not a i i respect the private interest too much to support a smoking ban in you know in private entities i guess i'm i you know to me the problem that you have is i feel like this is we're trying to manipulate behavior through taxation which i mean this is not the first instance in which we're trying to manipulate behavior through taxation but i guess i'm i'm i'm just again struggling with the aspect of you mentioned a three-pronged approach and if we've been dealing with this issue for i'm sure represent brown could give me the history here for a long time i don't think any any young kid is uh is shocked to learn that smoking isn't good for their health right they all began at at some point so how would you in you you mentioned earlier price could be a price sensitive to stop people from starting do we have you know i mean do we have other programs i guess again i've put my hesitancy into believing programs are the right way to go but tell me how you begin to narrowly besides just a a taxation which again i'm going to put on my libertarian small government street gets me very nervous about where does this money go to taking out private sector putting the public give me the the best program that you can think of that doesn't include a ban that doesn't include you know taxation that drives specifically towards getting young people to start i mean stop before they ever or not do it before they ever get started well when you look at community programs when you know you have our coordinators going into the schools and educating young people about the ills of smoking that helps i mean that's one of the things that we do lack in the state too we have programs in 92 counties and now we have them in less than 70 counties tobacco prevention cessation took a huge hit in this state when you look at the fact that we used to run the white lies advertising campaign on tv and now we have to really rely on what the cdc is putting out in terms of the um i can't think of that uh campaign where there's tips the tip the tips campaign uh we're not making that significant investment in tobacco prevention success i mean have we seen i mean when that investment dropped what happened to the percentage of smokers is there a correlation and a strong correlation that we could use to justify the investment so when we first when the program was first funded tobacco prevention cessation youth numbers significantly dropped now do i have the numbers right in front of me no but i'll get them for you the number significantly dropped because we made that investment when we stopped investing in those programs we've been tapering off we haven't continued to see that decline that we once saw when we were funded but again uh one of the things that we did see is that and what we know is that when we do pass a tax and i am going to go back to that um we could we could see a 13 reduction in smoking just among youth i mean when you look at the fact that you know uh youth are still being targeted for tobacco products we still have people that are selling you know tobacco products and gas stations where youth are right there products are right there in front and they're targeting their great flavor and orange flavor and purple flavor or whatever these are methods that they're using to target our youth and we have to continue to fight against those with enforcement programs and other programs thank you and maybe we shouldn't let them buy on sunday okay let's start there no tobacco sunday trying to reverse that actually i know i understand and i would like to hear i don't know if anybody from the vape community would like to also from a business perspective because i think we're all supportive of business in indiana and i want to make sure they have an opportunity are there any other questions for danielle representative brown no not for her mr chairman but perhaps the public policy committee as a whole would be interested in submitting a resolution to legislative council about this issue being studied this year because we need to get back to that in in in particular looking at the health aspect of how it's we may be spending less money on on health related issues but on the other hand we have to produce more for those folks that do not have health care coverage so uh i i presented a motion that we as a committee asked for a specific study this summer i think that's something we should consider for next week i don't uh argue that point representative lucas thank you mr chair i just want to point out the fact that state of indiana already recognizes different classifications of smoke or non-smoker for those of us um that are in their insurance we have to sign a waiver determining if we're going to smoke or not smoke and our rates are determined upon that if if we say we're not smokers and we get caught smoking not only do we lose our insurance but we can get fired so already that standard exists for that determination i'm very intrigued about the responsibility from the taxpayer money with the medicaid and how we reduce that and uh very interesting representative gia quinta um i i'll get some data because it's been a while but you know the city of fort wayne's had a comprehensive just real quick on this too the comprehensive smoking ban for quite some time at least 15 years with regards to bars and restaurants and i'll i'll circle back with them to see what impact of health is here and those sorts of things i know there's been some but i haven't seen it recently and then regarding the nicotine test we've discussed tests before and be kind of interesting to see what kind of economic impact of administering the tests versus the results of of actually how many pregnant women we actually do find that that are smoking and then third i'm just kind of curious what the new referee law could someone say i'm a smoker under my religion and therefore wouldn't have to be subject to a nicotine test all right um i do appreciate representative gia quinta bringing up fort wayne and he's a big supporter of allowing locals to decide and individual businesses decide what to do versus being mandated so i by the state level so i i appreciate that um thank you danielle for that and please send us all information that you have that you would like to share from this discussion and would anybody from the vape community like to speak up regarding their concerns or we appreciate the opportunity to talk thank you evan from a business perspective what are your thoughts here that directly could affect your situation well one of the interesting things um that we've seen in the vaping community and there are several studies that are either coming out or have come out in the past month is that vaping actually has the highest rate of success for taking a smoker and turning them into an ex-smoker we've seen several studies that have come out including the university of london that have said that people who switch from smoking to vaping have reparative function that their lung capacity improves um there are a multitude of benefits one of the statistics for you is that someone who uses vaping to stop smoking is a there's a 25 success rate for medication for smoke for a smoking cessation is 19 percent cutting cold turkey is 11 so vaping actually has the highest success rate for getting someone to become an ex-smoker and that's actually what we all got into this to do that's how it all started when somebody comes into our shop and says you know i want to start vaping the first thing we ask them is how much did you smoke what did you smoke we want to find the right method for you to make you an ex smoker that's we are we're rabidly anti-smoking we believe it's a personal choice for the individual but we don't like it we're an ex-smoker so that's it's a we support smoking smoking cessation programs we would like vaping to be included more in those programs to help people have a better alternative that's a more successful alternative to stop smoking evan and of the vaping product how much is used that has nicotine actually in it um it varies somebody who is coming into vaping at the very start typically uses a high nicotine level when i first started vaping i was at about 18 milligrams per milliliter over the period of about a month i started to drop that down faster and faster and faster to where now i'm at zero to three milligrams i mean it just depends um but so it's it's you see people rapidly drop their nicotine levels you know pretty pretty quickly but so most people start at a higher level but is the use of vaping the percentage use of those that vape have non-nicotine is that a large number or have zero nicotine zero that that most most people um uh largely people who have been vaping for a longer period of time let's say a year or more are on the lower level of between zero and three and that's the largest portion of the community so most people are at that lower threshold or at zero thank you evan any questions of representative houston so first of all is that like was that song like a hurricane okay name that band yeah uh neil young i believe scorpions i think scorpions who's in the 80s from here man i'm sorry uh so i mean i i just i have to ask aren't i just exchanging i mean chairman durham mentioned earlier you know um addiction um putting money towards addiction programs uh am i not just changing one form of addiction to another and and that the just to the benefit of those that are surrounding that person instead of smoking and there being a uh ancillary effect other people uh the advantage this rudimentary comments here i just want to be fair is that you know the that only one person is being impacted by the addiction within the vaping is that where would you agree and disagree with that broad-based statement um i would agree in a couple respects but i would largely disagree first nicotine as itself is actually being used in studies right now to help treat alzheimer's it's actually uh the there was a large national institution that actually showed that nicotine itself did not affect uh vascular function that it was the other points of smoking traditional cigarettes or traditional tobacco products that did that nicotine in small doses you know toxicity is related to dosage in any regard so caffeine is addictive sugar is addictive high fructose corn syrup is highly addictive um you know there are many things that we consume on a regular basis that actually are very addictive if you ever go a day without a cup of coffee you get a headache if you go a day without a sugary soda you get more than a headache you know so is nicotine in that realm sure but when we're talking about tobacco harm reduction the significant impact that vaping can have on somebody that switching from smoking traditional or using traditional tobacco products to something that is less impactful such as vaping is significant it's not just about combating addiction and within our community we encourage people to rapidly drop nicotine levels and the reason for that is because there is a a benefit um to um trying different technologies you know you've heard several different terms for devices here such as an e-cigarette and a vape pen and a personal vaporizing device and those things the the more you get involved with the technology the less nicotine you want in those products so we actually encourage people to drop nicotine as as quickly as possible um so i hope that answered the question thank you evan representative smalls evan thanks for being here i'm just wondering about just a piece of the bill on page four it talks about a person may not manufacture sell or distribute a liquid or gel substance containing nicotine or a nicotine liquid container unless it's in a child resistant package is that current standard procedure for most vape shops to put them in child tamper proof bottles or are they non-tamper-proof i would say probably at least 90 percent of the industry within indiana is probably on that level of using those child resistant packaging there are some people mostly what we see is some of the smaller shops may not have all of their product within that line but even national distributors are moving that direction of having child resistant packaging across the board so you would not see that as a substantial burden for the vaping community to have that that component in the law actually if i can if i can speak to that for this one bill um the only thing that actually gives us pause is the july 5th the july 1st of this year just for the tobacco license because we're dealing with we have over 150 shops that we talk to there are significantly other many there are many other shops that we are not um part of or communicate with probably an additional hundred shops that may not know about it they're not already talking to atc so they're not going to get notification now on as of july 1st you could have your entire inventory and your store destroyed that's our only real concern with the bill right now is that and we're going to try to help to get that information out to people we just hope that no business ends up having their inventory seized because they didn't have a permit on july 1st thank you evan representative brown thank you mr chairman so are you all recommending that that date be moved to what point would would be reasonable for those that may have a stock and may not get the word uh um it's it's less of this the stock it's it's the the permit is the bit is the big issue for us um just that timeline i honestly i don't know how you would communicate with the stores that that aren't part of our association there are a lot of like we actually don't work with any any quote unquote head shops we don't talk to them they're not part of our association but they do some of them sell vaping related products how they would find out about it that's that's a a question we have so i don't know what that timeline would be um you know is it an additional three months an additional six months i'm just not i don't know um but we're not willing to throw out the regulation like that we would like to work to maybe have that or some sort of notification process something in there would be would be beneficial and helpful or keep the july first date and move the descript destruction portion back or have something that wouldn't immediate on that day representative lucas thank you mr chairman that's what i was thinking like first time's a warning and next time we come back and check out your shop you better have an application receipt that would be that would be great because because then it's now you're being served with the notification if you didn't find out here's your we came in here's your notification you have to have this it doesn't take 30 days to get the the certificate you can do it online we'll be back in 30 days if you don't have it or a receipt proving that you filed for it then then we take your stuff that's good job all right the first time he's heard that this week on any other any other committee questions thank you evan thank you is there anybody else that'd like to yes please come up and uh state your name and who you represent thank you mr chairman uh members of the committee my name is joe lackey i'm president of the indiana grocery and convenience store association um and we sell a lot of these products also represent the indiana wholesale dealers association who are the tobacco candy wholesalers for indiana you would think that that would automatically make me opposed to what you're proposing here that's not necessarily true but a couple of cautions since you're looking at all these different aspects that i think have potential to impact when you raise tobacco taxes you do not necessarily lose all of those people you show a decrease in tobacco sales that doesn't necessarily mean you've got a decrease in smoking immediately you transfer sales to other locations you mentioned kentucky we're not going to get below kentucky kentucky has basically no tax on cigarettes our retailers in southern indiana don't sell a lot of tobacco because they're going across the border to buy it that will continue you raise the tax here you're just going to push more of them across a lot of them will probably go on sunday so they can get sunday alcoholic beverage sales and cold beer at the same time but that's that's another issue the other thing you've got to be concerned about if you raise taxes is an increase in black market it always happens you get what we call trunk slammers coming in selling them out of the back of trucks and vans and things like that that are completely illegal that means you need to look at maybe taking some of these funds and increasing your enforcement level you're asking atc here to take on a lot of new areas that they've not had before like the vape shops that's not been part of their venue in the past they're going to probably need some of that some of that money for increased funding question i have which wasn't addressed here really are you intending to include e-cigarettes and vapes in this tax are they going to be taxed that's never been addressed if that's going to happen you've got to define them are they an otp they're obviously not a tobacco product i would say they're probably an otp other tobacco product and if that's the case then they're going to need a tax level if you do that then the whole system kind of fits into your tobacco program that you spent a lot of money in years developing that means that in other words if it's a tobacco product by your definition then it has to be sold to a tobacco wholesaler and from a tobacco hostator it can only be sold to a licensed tobacco retailer which is what you already have in this bill you're licensing the vape shop as tobacco retailers so it would make sense to put it all in there that then gives revenue a audit trail where they can make sure that you're getting these tax dollars and all this falls into place i would highly recommend you talk to revenue a little bit revenue has got some real strong ideas about these taxes and how they should be structured but they're they've not been allowed to talk about taxes and it might be something you might want to ask them about it's one of those things they won't talk to you unless you ask them with regard to nicotine it was pointed out that nicotine is not all together bad and i think we've had this discussion with some of you in the past but uh for example the the cure to ebola uh was developed by r.j reynolds and it was nicotine that they were using as the basis for that cure for art for ebola and it still is and it's taking place down in kentucky uh where that's being being developed would strongly urge you to do the the uh the wholesale mandate where it has to go through a wholesaler to a retailer that will that will dramatically help the black market in the counterfeit issues um with that i'll quit if you have any questions i'll attempt to trust you one other question do you mind sharing you and i have talked about some of the language and i think it's you say non-controversial about you'd want to add to this bill we might as well put that on the table as well uh we we would like to well well there's two there's two areas since it's going to go back to i assume go back to ways and means since it's going to be taxed is it going to be recommitted if that's considered um one there is a tax that needs to be gotten rid of that revenue has asked us to help get rid of um which is that we have a tax now on tobacco rolling papers and tubes it was not enforced until this last year as a result of the tobacco settlement where indiana was cited and re and the ag can address this better than i but one of the things we were slammed for and lost some funds on was not enforcing all of the tobacco laws that are on the books this was one that was on the books that we were not enforcing because the law actually requires us to stamp the same thing that are on cigarettes to stamp tobacco rolling papers now if that doesn't make sense to you you're you're with us it makes no sense to us either it makes no sense to revenue what's actually taking place at this point in time is revenue is is when we pay the tax this very minor tax because we just don't sell tobacco papers anymore through our host sailors but if we if we sell any at all we go to revenue give them the money they mail us the tobacco stamps to go on the paper with instructions do not affix these stamps mail them back to us and they keep rotating them in and out of the building so they don't have to have them where stamps printed and they say they're really getting the smell really bad from going back and forth and back and forth regardless they want to take that off the books they'd like to get rid of that and i'll get you more detailed information on that another issue is display of cigarettes there was a mistake made in 2011 where we banned all tobacco from display from self-service all of it that was never the intention that goes beyond the fda regulations and what we would like to do is is allow pipe tobacco and cigars and we've got all these big boxes of cigars we've got these big cans of pipe tobacco and a lot of our stores we just simply don't have enough room to put them behind the counter and fda agrees with that and says that they can be self-service we would like to correct that uh right now that is not being enforced uh atc is giving us until the end of this session to to try to fix it because frankly they don't want they they would like to have the fda and the indiana laws the same for enforcement purposes they get the best compliance that way and they get the best enforcement from their atc officers but that was and you believe that was a fix that wasn't supposed to happen or i mean this would be a fix it was two of those that it wasn't supposed to happen the sponsor of the bill actually uh at the conclusion that was a short session he got very involved it couldn't be amended it was kicked out of the policy committee and you were not the chairman at that time it was kicked out of the policy committee um it was a mistake that's why there was a mistake we didn't intend to do that they can fix it in the senate it got over in the senate if it was amended in the senate it was going to be a dead bill it wasn't going to get out so they didn't amend it and but the but the sponsor of the bill sent a letter to the governor and to the atc asking them not to enforce that portion of it because they were going to fix it and one thing led to another and it never got fixed so it's still not being enforced uh but that's going to that's going to stop at the end of the session representative clare thank you mr chairman and thank you mr lackey i just wanted to clarify something because we've had a lot of confusion about the issue of defining e-cigarettes and what they really are and you made the statement i think a minute ago that e-cigarettes are not tobacco products no right now they're not defined as tobacco products but they're not being taxed right well one of the documents that i've used as i've worked on this e-cig legislation comes from the faq section of the views e-cig website so views v-usc is a type of e-cigarette correct yes and it's manufactured by who uh i can't answer that reynolds right rjr right rjr so i just so on on uh rjr's website for the vieux product one of the faqs is our views digital vapor cigarettes considered tobacco products and the answer is yes because views products contain tobacco-derived nicotine they meet the definition of tobacco products under the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act so i just want to clarify for everybody that even the manufacturers are regarding at least this major manufacturers regarding uh e-cigarettes as a tobacco product i i have no basis for disagreeing with that i i think you you look at the just as a citizen of the state if you look at if you look at the manufacturers of the e-cigarettes the major manufacturers they're tobacco companies right and it's not unusual it's being done in other states and understand i wasn't encourage you to tax e-cigarettes i'm just asking you if you intend to do that then you've got to consider what the definition is and i think one of the definitions that was put forward by revenue before was that that it includes e-cigarettes and anything that can be used in an e-cigarette you don't want to you stay away from the nicotine definition i would be the recommendation because that's going to get very confusing and how do you expect an excise officer to look at that when he goes into a vape shop is there nicotine in it or is there not he's going to have to depend on the label but what difference does it make i mean if you're going to if you're going to control it you control it and if it has the capability of going into an e-cigarette or is a vape whatever however you want to do it and then i think that that's you make it uniform across the board at that point you get the best enforcement and the best compliance thank you um any other questions thank you thank you mr le not a question i just think we should text thank you e-cigarettes like we do regular cigarettes thank you representative brown is there anybody else that would like to debate argue from the attorney general's office yes thank you mr chairman my name is larry hopkins with the attorney general's office i wanted to maybe just answer some of the questions that have come up first of all as it relates to this particular bill on the july 1st deadline for the retail certificate we'd like to keep that in place if if you want to allow just a warning on the first appearance i don't think that's a problem i think that's what we would expect atc to do anyway but one of the big issues is we just don't know where these shops are and i think the sooner we can figure out where they're all at and get somebody out there that'll be helpful i think that also will help the other bill that's going through and that a lot of those provisions don't kick in until the following year but it would be nice to know where all those shops are before those provisions kick in so we definitely like to keep the july 1st deadline if at all possible as it relates to extending the current excise tax not increasing it just extending it to e-cigarettes obviously our office has been in favor of that we sent you all a letter a couple weeks ago about that and i would just point out that you know one of the the recent studies that has caught everybody's attention is the rate of e-cigarette use among teenagers it's doubled in three years and so this is a product that has captured the fancy of teenagers and they are being drawn to it in droves and especially with teenagers one of the ways to deter them from smoking is to increase the price point and so i think that is a major focus for our office in the tobacco-free community is making sure we don't start a whole new generation of smokers whether they're vaping and nicotine is regardless of anything else it's still very addictive and so we don't want teenagers to start becoming vapers and then lead to becoming regular tobacco smokers so just extending the excise tax to e-cigarettes is one way to do it without increasing the tax but as other folks have testified obviously increasing the tax you can do that and still be the lowest in surrounding states and get back maybe some of the money that the state lost to the tobacco companies in the arbitration and keep in mind the arbitration money that money is being paid to the state to cover past health care costs so if and i you know our medicaid budget is uh what is it six billion dollars now so the tobacco companies since the inception of this agreement uh a little over 15 years ago have paid the state over a billion dollars just to recoup past costs so if you just think back in the 50s and 60s if this could have been foreseen and you could have been paying those costs as you go rather than recouping them now in arrears as we're forced to do be much better deal for the taxpayers so just a word that i think any tax whether it's extended or increased i think would be help offset the cost to the taxpayers for those medicaid expenses thank you what would you guess or estimate that the extension of the excise tax to the e-cigarettes how much would that generate well we did some analysis based on the state of minnesota who has had the tax in place for over a year now and we came up with estimates depending upon smoking rates in indiana versus minnesota that it could raise anywhere between 8 million on the low side and probably about 24 million on the high side per year 24 million thank you any other questions representative smalls um i'm curious about you talked about the effective date of the bill and it's important to you to remain july 1st would it would it be would it have a negative impact if we amended the bill to make the effective date july 1st but for the issuance of the certificates the tobacco certificates to people who do not have them now would we be able to do something that would say for businesses that are in place on july 1st 2015 they would have a 90-day window to get their permit would that somehow well i i think we would as i indicated we'd be supportive that if somebody didn't get their certificate which just to remind you getting the certificate is very easy you just get onto the website you pay your fee and you get your certificate so but if they didn't have it by july 1st i'd like to keep the the requirement there but be in favor of giving them a warning later a warning letter or something that they had to get it within the next 90 days or something thank you can i follow up representative smalls so what i see happening here is if i'm a shop and i don't have that certificate and i know that i don't have to get that certificate and i don't have to pay that expense until you catch me without it and i know that you're gonna warn me so i would just i think people would generally just wait until they got caught that one that one time and then be compelled so they don't lose the products in their store and that would put a burden on the atc to go around and seek compliance with these businesses that don't have that certificate i don't see there there's no motivation other than to do the right thing which is a good motivation but it's not enough to motivate everybody well practically i don't think atc is going to show up on everybody's doorstep on july 1st and be checking to see if they have their certificate it's going to take them a while to do that so i don't think there's going to be kind of the drastic effect that that maybe was discussed and i think normally they wouldn't be somewhat lenient on a law that's just taking effect so i i don't think you really need to do anything i guess i'm just suggesting i would like to keep the july 1st deadline if all possible with one brief question i'll be very brief but if i was in business and the law said that you could you could seize and destroy my inventory um i would base my concern on what the law says and not the the generosity and kindness of a governmental agency not disparaging any governmental agencies i don't disagree with you on that i can take my stuff and throw it away that's a problem i i i don't disagree thank you and we'll start wrapping up we have one brief question from representative lucas thank you mr chairman um representative smalls brings up a good point so to address his issue perhaps a fine the first time instead of somebody losing their entire inventory there has to be a happy medium a small fine if you get caught oh i agree i don't practically i don't think they would be taking anybody's inventory on july 1st i don't want to leave that up the discretion of a government agent though thank you representative lucas well i appreciate everybody's involvement um with this discussion brings up some interesting points to think about over the next week and uh with that just again a reminder please be prepared tuesday wednesday possibly thursday we got a couple of bills left to hear and then many to vote and i would ask you to re-look at the senate bill 515 and address your concerns with that so thank you with that we're adjourned oh
YARgpGabwLo,ID,03-25-2012,the hour of nine o'clock having arrived the house health and welfare committee is called to order first order business is roll call we'll ask the secretary secretary to take a silent role we do have a quorum present and we are ready for business next order of business is minutes we have business we have minutes for february the 11th the 17th and the 18th representative packer thank you mr chairman having read the minutes for february 11th 17th and 18th i move that we approve them as written thank you it's been moved to approve the minutes of february the 11th 17th and 18th as written are there any requests for changes any discussion further motions hearing none all those in favor the original motion say aye those opposed no the chair votes i and the minutes for february the 11th 17th and 18th are approved as written next uh our announcements committee we will not work tomorrow we will not work on monday we do have now five senate bills we will take those up next week probably a couple each day depending upon what length we have we are also going to go on the floor tomorrow at 10 30 and on the floor on monday at 10 30 and i suspect if we don't get the calendar cleared out to some extent the majority leader will will uh have us on the floor 10 30 through next week until we pair that down be my guest anyway next uh to the agenda the first agenda item is rs24575 social work recognition month representative rushi representative if you come forward and state your name and who you represent sir the podium is yours thank you mr chairman committee i'm john rushi representative in district six rs24575 is a very similar to a recognition resolution we did last year recognizing social work and social workers for for the uh work that they do helping our communities and declares along with the national organization that march is social work month and i think the important thing we all know the role that social work has in our child protective elder protective social welfare system but there have have an increasingly important role in health care including the grease that makes the cogs of the medical homework assisting the patients getting from place to place including the non-medical aspects of medical home transportation communication education etc in idaho we have a little less than 4 000 licensed social workers and that work hard to make their communities better and make lives easier for idahoans therefore mr chain mr chairman and good committee i ask that um you adopt this resolution um thank you are there any questions representative rushi representative romero for a motion mr chairman motion's always in order i would move to send rs 24575 to print and directly to the house floor to the second reading calendar it's been moved to introduce rs24575 and the second and to send it directly to the second reading calendar are there any further questions of rep cindy rushi hearing none is there any discussion of the motion hearing none all those in favor of the motion say aye those opposed no the chair votes i and rs24575 will be introduced and sent directly to the second reading calendar uh next agenda item is house bill 498 electronic cigarettes sales permits representative rushi again your name and who you represent sir and the podium is yours thank you mr chairman i'm still john rushi from district six um this bill house bill 498 adds the e-cigarettes to uh existing registration system for distributors and vendors of tobacco products this bill does nothing more than ad distributors and retailers it does not cause rep at the does not require reporting does not require taxing does not limit the sales other than to what's currently in law it uses the existing tobacco sales registry run through the department of health and welfare this registry is free and it's online and i guess the question is why do we do this well as i was investigating vaping and e-cigarettes neither health and welfare nor the tax commission had any idea who was selling these uh nicotine delivery devices we currently have laws on the book in the same chapter that that we're meant proposed to amend that makes it illegal to sell these devices and solutions to miners but we don't know who sells them or who distributes them the tobacco industry has already begun marketing e-cigarettes using the same techniques and processes that were used before and in your folder there should be some examples both of the old cigarette advertising and the new e-cigarette advertising as you can see it was fairly easy to reproduce the marketing plan from before and one of the outcomes of the marketing plan was the youth taking up tobacco youth uptake of e-cigarettes and vaping now outpaces traditional tobacco more start on e-cigarettes and flavored nicotine solutions than on combustible or chewable tobacco and while there's some evidence that e-cigarettes like other nicotine delivery systems patches gums etc may have a role in tobacco cessation programs there is no evidence that non-smokers are benefited by vaping the yet the flavored vape whether it's strawberry or bubble gum butterscotch or whatever is an attractive hazard it took decades to identify the heart full effects of smoking we all remember now probably laughing at the advertisements of physicians advertising cigarettes because they were smooth and cooling to the lungs well but subsequent to that time and science has shown that that was dangerous and harmful vaping and e-cigarettes are new there's not enough time to know what the long-term effects is but there is laboratory evidence of cellular damage to the respiratory epithelium the cells that line the respiratory tract and of the alveoli of the lungs from the uh chemicals that are in flavored vape so it's entirely appropriate i believe that the to use this existing registry uh to track the vendors and distributors of a product that is it currently illegal and may well prove to be harmful mr chairman i'd be happy to answer questions thank you representative are there any questions representing varushi representing vanuatu thank you mr chairman and representative hershey uh the people most of it is probably gone already through the convenience stores that already have the permit uh there are some you know strictly vape stores and stuff like that they are don't they have to have a sales permit in order to be in operations uh representative um mr chairman and representative they may have to have a local business permit but they do not have to have a register if there's not sell if they are not selling tobacco they do not have to have a registration with the idaho tobacco project the idaho tobacco project also provides a list of the vendors that local law enforcement and others can do monitoring of sales to minors if they don't appear on the list they can't be monitored follow-up follow-up um but don't these uh mr chairman of representative russi don't these businesses need a resale permit from this from the government so the government already knows that these businesses are out there in other words in order to collect sales tax you have to have a resale permit and so if they're collecting sales taxes they the government already knows these businesses are are out there they're not you know hidden in the back closet somewhere representative mr chairman and representative and woody according to the tax commission on my conversations with them and i had several they cannot tell whether you're selling apples or selling vape they just get a dollar amount on the sales okay thank you further questions of representative roushi representative redmond i think a chairman would i had a question now some of these vapes are not tobacco is that correct are they on tobacco mr chairman and representative yes some of them do not contain nicotine they contain flavoring uh they contain coloring but um there's two two ways to my mind that uh that vaping has a potential for harm first is a lot of them do contain nicotine and nicotine is an addictive substance and frankly there's evidence that if you can't get your nicotine from vaping you people buy cigarettes so yes you can use nicotine delivery systems to get off of smoking but if you get addicted to nicotine you go see searching the nicotine so that's one way that they're harmful the second is the volatilization of some of the flavor and coloring chemicals there's a study from harvard that talks about three flavoring chemicals in particular that are associated with a disease called bronchiolitis obliterans now bronchioles are the very tiniest air tubes before you get down to the air sacs or the alveoli and these chemicals are known hazards in the workplace uh this the coffee roasting uh painful if these chemicals are in the air they can cause this lung disease nobody knows if you're inhaling them directly from a vape apparatus how much how long but this is the the evidence is that these chemicals cause the epithelial cells to separate from each other and round up and in at least other mammals cause inflammation of those small bronchioles so the suspicion is that they do cause damage that the damage could be serious and permanent but again it'll take probably 30 to 40 years before we see it vaping is not is not a long-standing or old phenomenon it's a new phenomenon for the questions of representative rushi thank you mr chairman thank you representative apparently we do have um and aaron bennett uh that wishes to testify if you'd come forward and uh please state your name and who you represent ma'am the podium shores good morning mr chairman and members of committee my name is aaron bennett i serve as government relations director for the american heart association american stroke association in idaho and i'm here today in support of house spell 498. the aha is a non-profit nonpartisan organization working to prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke as leading causes of death through the support of research and evidence-based policy electronic cigarettes are still relatively new technology with frequent revisions and updates and relatively little regulation these factors among others have delayed the ability to obtain accurate data about the use characteristics and long-term effects of e-cigarette products on public health however preliminary studies indicate e-cigarette usage can lead to increases in heart rate and blood pressure atherosclerosis and coronary restriction there is also a potential to renormalize smoking behaviors promoting nicotine addiction and serving as a gateway to the use of other harmful tobacco products idaho statute already prohibits e-cigarette sales to minors however we're seeing the use of these products increasing year over year particularly in the youth market according to the 2015 idaho youth risk behavior survey 24.8 percent of idaho students in grades 9 through 12 had used an electronic vapor product in the past 30 days with 45.2 percent of idaho students having tried these products at least once as availability and diversity of these products increases we've seen more advertising focused on youth using the same appeals tobacco companies in previous decades as you've seen in your handout from representative rushi house bill 498 requiring individuals or businesses selling electronic cigarettes to register with the state will improve the ability to collect data regarding product sales and distribution which will help us understand the ability or understand and analyze the youth focused markets influence and help prevent youth access to these products before we have a comprehensive understanding of the public health impacts they might have we must work to reduce youth access to these products and as we learn more about the long-term health consequences of using e-cigarettes house bill 498 will help get us there the aha supports house bill 498 and urge you send it to the floor with a do pass recommendation might stand for any questions thank you are there any questions of miss bennett thank you thank you appreciate it very much is there anyone else in the audience that wishes to come forward to testify therefore against house bill 498 let the record reflect that no one else came forward committee house bill 498 is properly before the committee represented hixon mr chairman i would make a motion to send house bill 498 to the floor they do pass a recommendation and i may speak to my motion mr chairman go ahead thank you i think this is a probably a level-headed piece of legislation i mean these are relatively new in the marketplace it would be a good idea just in case we do have problems down the road to uh to have some sort of a paper paper trail leading back to the sources of these i'd like to see where it goes from there so mr chairman i would i would hope for a yes vote on this piece of legislation any further comments discussion for the motions hearing none all those in favor of the original motion say aye aye those opposed no you wish to be recorded uh record representative vander water's no chair votes i and house bill 498 will be sent to the florida do-pass recommendation representative rushi would you uh sponsor both of uh those on the floor yes sir i'd be happy to thank you next is uh house bill 453 medical lab science practice act representative king if you come forward state your name and who you represent ma'am the podium is yours uh thank you mr chairman and committee uh for the record i am representative phyllis king i represent district 18 in boise today i'm asking you to hold house bill 453 uh we have uh found some people that uh that uh we'd like to we'd we have come to a resolution let's put it that way with some of the folks and we're gonna rewrite re-draft this and uh bring it back to you so hold on to your all your your your packet of information we'll be back to fight another day thank you representative we'll have a motion to formally hold that representative packer thank you mr chairman and representative king thank you very much for your willingness to work on this i appreciate the hard work and the diligence that you've put in and in out of respect for her request i would move that we hold house bill 453 in committee thank you been moved to hold house bill 453 in committee for their discussion of the motion further motions hearing done all those in favor of the original motion say aye aye those opposed no chair votes eye and house bill 453 will be held representative king thank you so much for uh working and together with everybody and and we look forward to seeing your new rs and your new bill and we commend you on on working together and a collaborative effort and trying to get something that we can all go forward with thank you very much um next agenda item is house bill 500 medicare reimbursement rate jeff morrell intermountain hospital mr morrell if you'd come forward state your name and who you represent sir the podium is yours thank you mr chairman committee members my name is jeff morell i'm the ceo of intermountain hospital located in boise idaho we treat mental health patients uh adolescents and adults and uh this bill is a technical correction from house bill 298 that was passed in last legislative session this correction has to do with the reimbursement rate for adolescent patients specifically for free-standing hospital the previous bill identified the state portion of reimbursement only and not the matching federal funds for the general funding of all adolescent what this bill original language would do is actually reduce reimbursement to intermountain household by approximately two-thirds so i'm here today to correct that and the department is here to answer questions in regards to that methodology and reimbursement for our facility thank you mr morela now as i remember last year there was some significant discussion about whether or not the the rate seemed to be strange and and it was it was reported that that's the way that it was supposed to be to reflect only the general fund portion when in fact all of the budget work always includes both general fund and federal portion or dedicated fund portion of any monies that go in so this is just a technical fix to a bill last year that passed thinking that would be full reimbursement is that correct chairman thank you uh absolutely i'm relatively naive in regards to reimbursement through the medicaid reimbursement structure and with the help of the department of health and welfare we were able to identify the exact reimbursement methodology thank you are there any questions of mr morale representative thank you mr chair and mr morill so this will improve your ability to accept medicaid adolescent patients in your facility mr morell chairman representative rushi absolutely in fact we were able to open beds last year prior to this legislation being passed in april and we had approximately 54 days between april and june 30th that we would have been at capacity by opening up these extra 17 beds we were able to admit these vulnerable adolescents we had approximately 130 patients that we were able to treat during this time 62 of those 62 percent of those patients were medicaid um beneficiaries further questions of mr morrell for follow-up representative um mr chairman i'm going to move that we uh send whatever numbered oh bill 500 to the floor with the duke pass um the uh having still fairly good connections to the pediatric community in the state adolescent beds are a premium and anything that opens the capacity is is going to be a benefit thank you it's been moved to enter or it's been moved to send house bill 500 to the floor of the do pass recommendation are there any further questions of mr morrell is there anyone in the audience that wished to come forward to testify for or against house bill 500 but the record reflect that no one else came forward committee is there any further discussion of the motion any further emotions hearing on all those in favor of the original motion say i i those opposed no the chair votes eye on house bill 500 will be sent to the floor the do pass recommendation representative ramrell would you carry this on the floor sir thank you mr morrell committee is there anything else that needs to come before the committee before we uh adjourn mr chairman i would note ask that the attendants show that representative perry is present [Laughter] committee's

w6lvIoVVVE8,ID,03-13-2015,get a little ranches here i'm going to call the meeting to order and carroll if you please take a silent role today we are have a pretty long agenda but actually it looks a lot worse than it is and i want to thank the committee and all of you for being here early so that we could get through this and and let people who have to get on the road have that opportunity at a decent time we are we will go with the first approval of the minutes for february 16th senator tibbetts could you take that i sure could madam chairman i reviewed the minutes and found them to be in order and move that we approve the minutes of february 16. it's been moved by senator tibbetts second by senator johnson that the minutes of february 16th be approved is there any discussion see none those in favor signify by saying i'm all right those opposed minutes will be approved minutes of march 2nd senator johnson thank you madam chair i've reviewed the minutes of march 2nd 2015 and i would recommend approval been moved by senator johnson second by senator hagendorn that the the minutes of march 2nd be approved is there any discussion on those minutes cnn those in favor signify by saying i'm all right those opposed minutes will be approved i do not see senator heider so we will go on down to rs two three eight one one chairman senator david is it uh just a unanimous question on all three of those i would move we print for rs uh two three seven nine two twenty three eight one one twenty three eight forty two three seven five four c one been moved by senator davis second by senator hagedorn madam madam chair i think uh rs 2375 one is before the committee for introduction or print and it's not a unanimous consent request okay that would be the last two so we have two that we i apologize i'll just do the first two twenty three seven ninety two and eight one one thank you for correcting me said senator berdoran i appreciate that so those in favor of of the unanimous consent please signify by saying i i those opposed then we'll be i messed that one up too sorry about that someday i'll get this down uh those will be sent back to those committee senate health and welfare to be heard rs 23840 senator rice senator rice i was trying to give you a quick print hearing thank you madam chairman members of the committee this this is the redraft that has incorporated suggestions from senator burgoyne on making sure that we're covering arrests we're covering prosecutions that resulted in dismissals we're covering prosecutions that will resulted in acquittals as well as convictions also in addition it does provide being enslaved is one of those ultimate forms of coercion and so what it does is it allows these actions to be brought by a victim of human trafficking if they were coerced so they use the it anything that would that a defense of coercion would be a defense for is added in um it actually provides a much more it's i think more direct easier to understand there's guidance on exactly what needs to be in the petition um and so i would ask for a print of this so that we can move forward with it madam chairman senator tibbetts madam chairman i move we print rs23840 been moved by senator tibbetts second by senator souza that the rs23840b printed is there any further discussion see none those in favor signify by saying i'm i'm those opposed the irs will be printed and come back to our committee thank you senator wright all right rs 23754c1 senator going thank you madam chair may i do it from here to me thank you um this rs provides for an interim legislative committee to study the appointment of administrative hearing officers for contested cases held by state agencies to study contested case procedures and to study the processes for appealing from contested cases decisions in the courts these contested cases are quasi-judicial proceedings in which the rights of citizens are adjudicated by the agencies often with the use of contract hearing officers and in some cases the deciding officials in the agencies are full-time employees such as the directors of the agencies themselves they can be over issues of pollution and pollution fines it can be over whether to suspend a liquor license they can be over a variety of different things having to do with professional licensing boards and the ability to practice one's professions they have real impacts on people now there have been problems with contested cases and the one that i thought i'd just use as an example is not too long ago the federal government came into the department of health and welfare and essentially questioned the impartial impartiality of contracted hearing officers who are dependent for income and reappointment as hearing officers and whether they are truly unbiased in that situation or not and threatened federal funding for medicaid and as a result those hearing officers are now being transitioned to work under the auspices of the attorney general so we know we have problems and representative luker and i have been working on this issue for quite a long time the issues are highly complex and we think an interim committee would be appropriate to study these issues we could be bringing you bills and getting this piece and that piece and would it all fit together when we're done and we think a more comprehensive approach is a better approach and just want to highlight one other example of a problem when you are litigating with an agency in an administrative hearing often it's the agency that has all the documents that you need in order to to resist the allegations against you the current rules of the attorney general which govern contested cases don't give a citizen a right to discovery to obtain these documents if they're relevant and that's left to the agencies to decide whether they will give you discovery or not and the agency is a party to the proceeding in many cases and is not just a neutral arbitrator and so to give one party the right to decide seems somewhat unfair and this is another issue that needs to be looked at and that's why this is before you today for introduction we'd like to have an interim committee to discuss and to look into and study the issue thank you thank you senator other questions or comments senator hagedorn madam chairman i would move rs 2375 to print their second second jordan um it's been moved by senator hagedorn second by senator jordan that rs 237 five four c one be sent to print is there any further discussion chairman senator just an inquiry would it be the intention of the sponsor and or the the chairman that we request this be returned to the committee for hearing or would we assume that it's just going to go to the 10th order for consideration on the floor what what is what is the proper thing senator davis madam chairman i think he would go directly to the floor unless we made a request to come back and so i was just wondering if that request was was understood or not what are your wishes senator madam chair i confess having been almost all the way through one full session as a senator i really don't know what that protocol is on this side of the rotunda and so i would i would yield to the to the judgment of the committee on that and senator davis always helps me out on this senator davis well uh thank you madam chairman senator tippett's understanding of processes is absolutely right and because it is just a concurrent resolution it would go after print to the tenth order of business and be held for a legislative day in the event however that is the desire the committee to have further review and if the floor does not have a problem the matter can be returned to committee i would just add however that for interim committees it is going to be a senate concurrent resolution once it makes its way to the body across the rotunda it will be held there by the chairman of that committee until majority and minority leadership from both bodies have the proverbial annual lunch to decide which ones will be funded and then the committee on that side will look in their drawers in advance just those so in the event that it went straight to the 10th and it cleared the floor of the senate that doesn't necessarily mean it would get a hearing on the house side until leadership meet and make that decision sam davis do you meet more than once a week this particular lunch is just an annual lunch and it's normally held about now and if the 27th was more realistic it probably would be set for the first of the week and so in fairness at least to the issue the sooner it gets off one side the greater the likelihood that it would be advanced i do think that senator going and representative luke or bring us a very serious issue i don't practice as much administrative law as senator mcgoing does but i've had hearing officers that have been as professional frankly as anybody could hope for and then we've had other experiences as well so um and and agency loyalty is a challenge and it's this is something that we have talked about doing in the past but there's a price tag associated with this and it's not likely to be small but what i understand the resolution is asking for is the right to have the conversation and and so i i'm going to vote to print if the committee wants to have another hearing on it i certainly can support the desire of the committee either way okay committee what are your desires about a hearing senate hacker madam chairman um i i would just prefer to print and send it to the senate to the floor that was your motion that was my motion [Music] okay any other thoughts see none um senator's motion was to print and send to the floor those in if there isn't any further discussion those in favor signify by saying aye aye those opposed it will be printed and sent to the floor thank you senator for going senate bill 1136 sandy jones um before sandy starts i'd just like to say committee this is really actually a part of justice reinvestment that some of the cleanup work that that we needed to we knew we would have to do a few and a few different things and this is one of the things that we discovered that needed to be addressed sandy welcome to the committee please please state your name and who you represent good afternoon members committee my name is sandy jones i'm with the commission for pardons and parole and this bill just represents as senator elijah said an adjustment to the original language in senate bill 1357 now 2229 the justice reinvestment act currently the bill requires the parole commission to impose sanctions of up to 90 or up to 90 days for a first major parole violation for a technical violation up to 180 days for a second violation of parole the bill also allows the commission to reduce the number of days by 30 days for appropriate behavior while in custody as it's written the commission would have to impose these sanctions directly the actual five-member commission this would significantly lengthen the time before the sanction can be imposed leading to more time in custody beyond the intended 90 or 180 days as the commission is only in session certain times a month they serve part-time they might serve for two weeks out of a month so by delegating this authority to a hearing officer these sanctions can be imposed in a timely manner leading to faster turnaround of intermediate sanctions for parole violators this supports the spirit in the intent with within the criminal justice i'm sorry the justice reinvestment initiative for swift and certain responses to violations i believe this is the way it was intended to work in the first place the language just doesn't give us the authority to have the commission delegate that responsibility to a hearing officer the bill would also delegate or allow delegation of the ability to shorten the sanction time to that same hearing officer this is the essence of this bill and with that i would stand for any questions are there any questions for sandy see none of that sam johnson for a motion motion's always in order thank you uh madam chairman i would move senate bill 1136 to the floor with a due pass recommendation been moved by senator johnson second by senator we're going the senate bill 1136 be sent to the floor with the due pass recommendation is there discussion see none those in favor signify by saying aye aye those opposed motion carries thank you thank you very much all right thank you committee you're doing very well all right now we're going to be visiting with representative luker we'll see if we can keep him on on the straight narrow path so that you can get on your journeys today welcome to the committee thank you thank you for being here today uh thank you madam chairman members of the committee it is friday and so i will try and be brief afternoon as it is on friday just as a preface these four bills uh have to do with a couple of different uh reviews first the criminal justice commission has been in the process for some time of reviewing our current statutes for reclassification from misdemeanor to infractions and otherwise bringing our statutes in line with making the penalties commensurate with the crime and so couple that with the defense or the defense public defense reform interim committee which is trying to reduce our load on public defenders and improve our system that way and so these suggestions originate with the criminal justice commission and then were adopted by the public defense reform committee as a method of reducing load on the public defenders and in the process of that brings us to house bill 101 in the process of the criminal justice commission's review they identified a couple of statutes that they didn't think we needed at all anymore and the first one and so this repeals those two sections the first one is 18707 uh which deals i guess in a manner of speaking with the the idea of impressment you remember back in the origins of the war of 1812 where the british were impressing our sailors into duty well what this does it deals with the posse comitas and it allows the sheriff under threat of criminal sanction to impress citizens to join the posse and it hasn't been used for a while and it's probably time to to to to remove that policy oops okay here we go to remove that policy from our books and at least the commission felt so so that's the first one uh the second one they're all in the same bill okay oh the second part so there's two two portions to this a section two repeals section 49 230 and that's that deals with tampering with vehicles however it's covered under other aspects of the criminal law breaking and entry malicious destruction of property and other things and this actually resides in the in the motor vehicle code and so it was felt by the commission that this wasn't necessary it hasn't been used again for some time and so those are the two uh bills that are statutes that would be repealed in in house bill 101. i always like repeals like taking taking laws off committee questions senator souza madam chairman for a motion motion's always in order thank you madam chairman i move that we send house bill 101 to the floor with a due pass recommendation it's been moved by senator susan seconded by senator bear that house bill 101 be sent floor with the due pass recommendation is there any discussion senator hagedorn thank you madam chairman just a question i know oahe county sheriff still has an active posse and i'm wondering if this has any impact on people who volunteer for that posse representative madam chairman senator hagedorn i don't believe so i'm sure in today's society he will have plenty of volunteers to join his posse all right thank you senator davids thank you madam chairman and representative luca i know this conjures up images of the bank robbery and the sheriff deputizing some people and they get on their horses and right away to go try to find the bank robber but as i look at this this was actually added in 1972. and i i've known that we've had laws on the books that say for example if if a law enforcement officer is trying to apprehend somebody who's being difficult that they could say hey you guys come help me and and is that this section of the code or is there somewhere else a requirement that says that in that moment that a sheriff can ask somebody come help and they're required to do that i'm not sure that this is that but so i'm not good yeah madam chairman uh senator tibbetts i'm i'm not sure that that is the provision either and this has gone through again the criminal justice commission where the sheriff representative prosecutors all of our law enforcement folks so i trust their judgment on that okay thank you madam chairman thank you representative hooker thank you for going yes thank you madam chairman and representative luker i don't know if you have any information about this but it it strikes me that in this day and age to essentially commandeer a human being for a law enforcement activity might raise some interest at places like i crimp and and the civil liability issues and i just wondered if that in any way um uh if if these notions of modern civil liability uh impact uh the viability of actually commandeering a posse representative madam chairman senator bergoin those are great questions i did not delve into it that deeply so i whether that was part of the discussion at the criminal justice commission i'm not sure any senator tibbets thank you madam chairman so representative luke are now now on the other code section that we're repealing i think the statement of purpose indicated that this is covered elsewhere in the law but frankly when i look at the section we're repealing it sounds to me like a pretty reasonable loss says you don't climb into somebody else's car and start fiddling around put it in gear or that sort of thing if you if you do that you've committed a crime if you don't have their permission so can you tell me if there are other provisions that would prevent that kind of behavior representative chairman senator tippets again i i don't have all the specific code sections there are there are uh whether it whether it deals with specifically starting somebody else's car uh it may not be that specific but the prosecutors seem to be fine with this i haven't heard anything from them in this journey and of course they have representation on the on the commission as well so again the main thing it hasn't been used in years is the information that that i was given madam chairman senator follow up so madam chairman representative luke if it hasn't been used in years then it certainly isn't a burden on the prosecutors and we're not lightening their workload by getting rid of this but it just seems to me that at some point in time you know this is something that i think ought to be if if not a misdemeanor an infraction at least but it seems like it ought to be illegal but frankly it's compelling to me that you say the prosecutors think that we ought to do away with it so i guess i'm likely to support it but i'm just wondering frankly i'm curious why we're eliminating it thank you representative holly cool is here and so we can we can get a prosecutor's opinion holly welcome to the committee holly thank you chairman members of the committee um i don't have that code section in front of me but i can say that we did have representatives on the misdemeanor reclassification committee we do have a representative on idaho criminal justice commission so while i don't have that code section in front of me and i apologize for that i don't know exactly the wording of that but i can safely say that we have had members on those subcommittees and at this point i have not heard any opposition from a prosecutor in striking that code section senator coin thank you madam chair holly um even though you don't have those provisions in front of you i think in the statement of purpose on this bill it makes reference to 49 230 on tampering with a vehicle being addressed by other laws and and representative luker made comment about breaking and entering malicious destruction of property can you help us at all to understand maybe just a little bit better what what other laws besides tampering with a vehicle would be covered by that kind of behavior holly uh senator lodge representative or senator going excuse me um i can try um there there are it just all depends on the facts i know i say that a lot in this committee but um if the day if there was damage to the vehicle then we could charge much into property um if somebody actually moved the vehicle then that's ground for grounds for ground theft if they stole something inside the vehicle that's also grounds for grand theft there's a joyriding section that if somebody doesn't have the intent to permanently deprive but drives it down the street um then we have a joy writing section i think there are other sections in in the code that would address most of the behavior but again that's all driven by the facts management chair just just one holly if somebody was to just get into the vehicle and kind of play with the knobs and you know or the screen or or whatever just kind of play with the vehicle and be in the vehicle is there any notion of trespass that would attach or interference with shadows or you know any of those kind of civil or criminal concepts that you know maybe there's no damage maybe the vehicle isn't moved but you don't you don't want somebody doing that holly uh chairman senator we're going there's unlawful entry um i'd have to look at that code section again to see if that extend to a vehicle um again i don't have these in front of me so you're really challenging my my brain here but there is an unlawful entry code section um trespass would not fit um but unlawful entry may okay all right holly thank you for letting me put you on the spot like that i appreciate it representative are there any further questions representative luker see none committee what are your wishes for house bill 101 oh i'm sorry emotions been made i well no i need all the help i can get the um motion's been made those in favor signify by saying i'm i those opposed bill will be sent to the floor representing luker house bill 102. thank you madam chairman uh this is a change to uh curfew violation uh currently it's misdemeanor for juvenile to be out after curfew this would make it a infraction 150 fine that's it oh my gosh committee any discussion senator jordan thank you madam chairman i'm sorry you were so close um i do have one question i've gotten some communication on this and there's just been one concern expressed that i've heard and that is that this strikes the provision for any detention and while i understand that we certainly don't want to be um detaining juveniles in in a formal way um the communication i've received indicates a concern on the part of law enforcement that sometimes all they need is a couple of hours to maybe track down a parent or a guardian and return the child to where they need to be and that might require holding them for just a little while so has there been any discussion about including some language that might allow for just a temporary detention while that effort is made representative madam chairman senator jordan um typically if you have you don't have a rest authority with the infraction now section title 20 deals with juveniles in section 520 and 522 whether that could be used in conjunction in conjunction with an infraction i'm not sure and i don't know if miss cool has you don't have it you can't yeah because it's a yeah it has to be a right that's that was my thought so that's why it's being stricken is because it's inconsistent with with an infraction um now um and and that's certainly an an issue the question is do we continue to make it a misdemeanor simply because of that concern there's probably other bases for for holding a juvenile uh other than just being out after curfew if that after cure for you they're probably doing maybe something else too but um so it is it is a concern yes is it a major concern enough to continue making this a misdemeanor the criminal justice commission didn't feel like it was so follow up madam chairman and thank you madam chairman um representative luker please don't misunderstand because i definitely feel like this change needs to be made i think a misdemeanor for this offense is is a little bit heavy-handed and burdensome to law enforcement i just want to make sure as the new person and sorry but i'm asking a lot of new person questions this week that i understand that um um detention is tied to the charge of a misdemeanor that there's no ability to to detain in the face of an infraction even if it's only temporary is that what i'm hearing um uh senator jordan if if there's probable cause of a lot of different things you can stop and you know and for a lot of different different things and detain uh arrest is different than detained so there is a distinction there okay thank you for that clarification sam davis thank you madam chairman the only thing i would add to what representative luker has said is if you look at line nine this deals with the punishment side of it that's all this is and so what are their what other whatever other police powers may exist by municipal or county ordinance those would be self-executing this is only after there's been a determination judicially and now we're dealing with the punishment or the imposition of the punishment so i believe that to amend to provide for some retention would not be the purpose of this particular title and chapter you bet sir did you have me okay all right are there any further questions for representative luke i do have um someone else signed up um mary kathy good afternoon members of the committee my name is kathy grismar i'm the public policy strategist for the aclu um i just have general comments on house bill 101 which i'm happy that you already moved forward to that to the senate floor which was our recommendation we just wanted to share our support for representative lucar's initiatives here to engage in misdemeanor reclassification especially as misdemeanor prosecution does play a significant role in our broken public defender system and in reducing some of those misdemeanor charges down to infractions is helping to alleviate some of the burden those public defenders are facing the only thing that we would ask is that some of these smaller infractions that are coming before you today are really generally pretty small i think for the first offense it was about 30 combined between the two offenses and then in house bill 102 about 20. if we were to look at something like driving without privileges there's 12 000 misdemeanor charges every year that would be a significant decrease in the burden for public defenders and so we're very supportive of the initiatives and are always open to the opportunity to discuss further misdemeanor reclassification with the committee thank you kathy thank you very much all right committee uh seeing uh senator souza thank you madam chairman for a motion motion's always in order i move that we send house bill 102 to the floor with a do pass it's recommendation moved by senator susan second by senator hagedorn that house bill 102 be sent the floor with the do pass recommendation senator johnson thank you madam chair i i can't pass this up and i apologize but i have never seen this sort of detail in a fiscal note and i'm looking for the 12 and 36 cent sandwich or something like that but it's incredible the details so i thank you for that but that's that's very impressive thank you thank you senator johnson all right if there isn't any further discussion those in favor signify by saying aye aye those opposed bill will be sent to the floor senator representative luker thank you madam chair and members of the committee house bill 121 modifies a little what we did last year in house bill 434 we set the foundation for this reclassification by making some amendments to our infraction law one of them was increasing the infraction maximum from 100 to 300 we also restored in the legislature the authority to set fines that had been given to the supreme court and one of the provisions that was in the bill was to deal with a few infractions that were out there that did not have specific fines but that used language such as not to exceed or up to a certain amount and that's inconsistent with infractions the idea behind infractions is you write a ticket you know the amount you can pay it or you can go contested in court in the interim the supreme court did identify two of these and so what we're doing is we are changing those to set infraction amounts and removing subsection 4 in 18 113a because that's no longer needed so the two sections flooding on highways is just set as at fifty dollar fine which was there already and uh public smoking uh at seventeen fifty and that was up to fifty but that 1750 is comes from the the schedule said this over the supreme court so that doesn't there's no budget impact it's pretty much neutral so that's that's the bill and thank you representative i'm really glad to reread 183904 because sometimes i have a little trouble with sprinklers going on the road when there's wind out so i thank you for bringing that part so i could refresh my memory senator souza thank you madam chairman representative lucha i have one quick question for you is there a i see the 17.50 uh charge yes and the 15.50 charge is there a 12 sandwich in here somewhere um i think it's i think it's a new york state the 1750 not not at today's beef crisis i don't think any further discussion on house bill 121. senator hager madam chairman i would move uh we sent house bill 121 to the floor with a due pass recommendation [Music] it's there it's been moved by senator hager during second by senator bear the house bill 121 be sent to the floor any further discussion see none those in favor signify by saying i'm aye those opposed bill will be sent to the floor house bill 159 representative you're doing really good in fact i think the senate committee will be very happy because they'll be about 20 minutes ahead of schedule excellent this is uh house bill 159 dealing with the use of by minors of tobacco products in in the prior law everything was all jumbled together at consumption uh and distribution so what we did is we we separated those out and and just had the consumption use uh offenses in subsection one and then the selling and distribution and made a new subsection for that and any uh use uh violations is uh an infraction consistent with the one we just looked at 1750 and i would i would add in that it's not just 1750 there are court costs and fees by the time you get through all those it's about 72 or 74 dollars so it's it's not just 1750. the uh the second part the distribution or or sale of tobacco or there's subsection three false identification obtaining tobacco under false id that would be a first offense of infraction 200 and then it would flip over into a misdemeanor if it's a repeat so those are the changes there i guess i'm i'm just had a grandson of a good friend who was caught with tobacco at school and it was a 200 fine and i see the 200 here but it doesn't seem to fit in with a first-time possession of of tobacco can you explain that a little bit to me how that works yeah madam chair that would have been a misdemeanor set by the judge because right now that it is a misdemeanor so he probably got more than just a ticket written i would assume i i thought i thought it was but it's a juvenile offense so it doesn't show you know it's handled as a juvenile offense two hundreds quite a bit for a kid to work off well we're reducing man i'm sure we're reducing that at least for consumption and use but for the distribution that would still be he wasn't distributing senator burgoyne thank you madam chair and representative i uh um i like i like this i have a question about uh lines of 29 well 28 29 30 to 32 on the reduction on the misdemeanor to 30 days and a 300 fine was that done because of a sense of that's what it ought to be that's just just and reasonable or was there some thought that by reducing the misdemeanor penalty we might avoid uh public defender issues can you just explain why that's there madam chairman senator burgorn the former because once it's a misdemeanor you still implicate the public public defender and madam jeremy i have another question senator thank you the final sentence of the provision on lines 32-30 is not amended but i'm just wondering if the way we're changing the statutes it talks about in addition to the penalties uh which to me at least doesn't sound like the infraction would be a penalty i think it's a civil violation perhaps the court can require the attendance of the tobacco awareness program and that would seem to me to be particularly apt with respect to a simple consumption a 1750 fine and go to a tobacco awareness program i was just wondering the way we've set this up is the court going to have that option given the word penalties there in the sentence uh madam chairman senator burgoyne uh you raise a good point that hasn't been raised before and i would assume if you just read it it's ambiguous as to whether it applies to everything or misdemeanor but because it's in penalties are civil or criminal however just in the application of uh infraction laws i would assume they would just be writing a ticket and there wouldn't really be any further jurisdiction to impose that in an infraction unless perhaps they contested the ticket and then went in in front of the judge that's certainly something we could look at in the future to clear clarify sarah davis uh thank you representative a bunch of 14 year olds head out walking home one has a pack of cigarettes they took from mom and dad obviously that triggers the infraction part to be in possession and their friend says give me one of those now are they guilty of distribution representative senator lodge uh senator davis say yes in in the pure sense of the term uh that's uh certainly uh would be within that second part of the section you have to remember that all of this was a misdemeanor to start with anyway and so they originally would have been charged with a misdemeanor and so we're trying to parse this out as best we can maybe there's some more minute mechanic work we can do with it but i think it's an improvement from where it was follow-up and i agree with your representative and what we're looking at here is better than what we have right now uh but was there much conversation or thought about uh defining distribution to be more than x number of whatever so that you you keep well you just finished that up for me thank you madam chair uh senator davis no we didn't drill down that deep um there is certainly discretion on the part of an officer to just give a possession ticket as opposed to a distribution ticket but we and we can we could drill down at some time in the future if if we want to do that any further questions represented johnson thank you madam chair um [Music] i'm just trying to make sure that i'm reading this so what are what is or what are the violations of subsection four and five uh okay for a minor who is assisting with a random unannounced inspection okay these are exculpatory so if you've got somebody who's out helping abc and uh trying to do the sting that protects them madam chair i got ahead of myself i apologize i read that and i was thinking something else but thank you okay thank you madam chairman i would move that we send house bill 159 to the floor with a new pass kathy do you still want to testify no i just wanted to share we're supportive of the bill and all the same points i raised earlier with 101 and 102 stand for for this bill as well okay thank you okay so um senator hagerdorn do i have second all right um sarah senator hagendorn has moved that house bill 159 be sent to the floor and with senator bear uh seconding is there any further discussion seeing none those in favor signify by saying i i those opposed motion will be sent to the floor the committee you did you did very well thank you very much representative you did very well and we have a long agenda on monday and if you could do this very same thing on monday it would be really great um thank you for uh coming in on friday afternoon i know it's difficult for those of you that have to travel a long distance and we have a pretty full agenda as i said for monday and some um on wednesday and then i hope to give you next friday off since you've been so good good today and if there isn't anything else that needs to come before the committee we are adjourned and thank you very much it'll be um nice enjoy your weekend um um okay oh
sDjgqpX7mLg,CO,04-28-2016,you you good afternoon committee the business affairs and labor committee will come to order ms altman will you please take the roll call representatives aren't here present morrow yes nordberg excused rosenthal [Music] committee today we have three bills before us we're going to hear house bill 16 14 52 house bill 14 16 14 55 and house bill 16 13 70. and we'll start with 16 14 52 with representative melton representative melton welcome to the business committee and i will share with you chair that we will only hear testimony on house bill 16 14 52. i want to make sure all of you have the sponsor's amendments because i will grant him the opportunity to speak to his amendment so that we will have all the necessary information as we go away and determine how we'll do this when we come back for action only and representative melton please tell us about your bill thank you madam chair and members i present house bill 1452 um this bill basically allows or creates a new permit for um for hotel or for hotels with hotel restaurant licenses to be able to sell wine that is corked um and let me explain uh where this bill is coming from or the history behind this so currently with restaurants um if a patron comes in and decides that they want to buy a bottle of wine and take it with them the restaurant has to actually uncork the wine pour some of it for the person to drink and then they can re-cork it and seal it and the person can go this takes an unnecessary step um for a very limited uh class of restaurants uh those that are attached with a hotel restaurant license uh making it more of in my opinion more of a tourism bill than a liquor bill because of this clientele these are more so travelers who are visiting our states staying in a hotel visiting the restaurant may not have transportation to a local liquor store or anything like that um they're more so just looking uh for the convenience of being able to purchase a bottle of wine and take it to the room or take it to a party or something like that without having it uncorked um being a person that's worked in this industry for a number of years i worked as a front office manager uh for several different hotels um i can tell you that the hotel industry is changing and in many ways many of the amenities that were offered in hotels like mini bars are also going away and so by allowing restaurants to then be able to just sell a ball of wine as they normally would and but corked uh it allows restaurants to then or allows hotels excuse me to then be able to uh provide a service to their guests and again um really provide for our tourism industry here in colorado a unique and special service this isn't unique to colorado several other states have also done this with this special type of permit i have heard argument that there is other legislation that's coming down the pipe regarding selling of alcohol in grocery stores and whatnot um i can tell you that this is a very different issue and it's a very different bill because of the clientele that it's serving in many cases these again are travelers that are in the hotel we don't expect necessarily for neighbors or people that may live next to the hotel to choose this as opposed to going to a liquor store or grocery store this again is being very catered to individuals who are new to our cities and our towns across the state and again provides a nice convenience for them in areas where they may not uh be aware of of what else is in the area um and with that members i do have three amendments um and if it's okay i'll speak to those yes representative melton please proceed thank you madam chair um l001 uh it actually strikes out language on page three lines three through 13. um this was unnecessary in actually duplicative language uh regarding um iding for the cell of alcohol because this is already addressed in both state statute and federal law um it was unnecessary to keep it in this bill and was thus making the bill a little more cumbersome for uh for certain um interested parties in the state and so we are striking that language and this bill will still apply to state and federal law l003 addresses a concern that there are some other pieces of legislation being brought forward namely a bill that i believe is being sponsored by uh representative ryden um this bill or this amendment would comply with that bill should it pass but only if it passes so if that bill does not pass this this amendment is clearly uh spelled out in line seven through 10 that this amendment will not take effect and then on uh l004 there were concerns that because a liquor license is both governed by state and local authorities that we needed to have a local component to this and so this allows for uh local licensing authorities and municipalities to be able to issue out a local permit and be able to charge fees on that and so with that members i am happy to answer any questions you may have thank you representative melton representative melton my first question is do you know how many um hotels with restaurants attached to them how many if you pass this bill have the possibility of implementing your piece of legislation uh thank you madam chair i am not clear as to exactly how many um no i'm sorry i believe in the fiscal note if you look on page two it looks like the number affected uh would be around 146. thank you representative melton my second question is is with these 146 businesses that are out there that could possibly fall under this piece of legislation how would the licensing laws work because what if there is one owner that has six different hotel or restaurants connected to it or under that one piece of management or ownership can you clarify the licensing rules around multiple ownership of institutions sure um thank you madam chair i believe that with the permit the permit would go with the existing license so if someone already has a license and they have it in multiple properties the permit is more so just an add-on or a supplement to their current license so they would only need as many permits as they do licenses currently thank you representative arndt thank you madam chair um so i understand the intent is to serve the people or stay in the hotel that makes sense would it exclude people who are not hotel guests from buying representative melton thank you manager i don't believe it would but and i believe that's the case currently with restaurants um any restaurant you walk into right now you could purchase a bottle of wine have it uncorked pour you know say a half an a half a glass of it and then have it re-corked and leave and so um yes it would apply to the same patrons as it does currently it's just because these are restaurant hotels uh in many cases it's rare that those hotels are receiving guests from outside of the hotel as opposed to just a normal restaurant representative arndt thank you madam chair so just to follow up on that so and i see the liquor enforcement person there maybe i i mean i don't know this is just an honest question if you went into now and got it uncorked and took it out then you'd be subject to open container laws if you know if it's corked you can get in your car because i'm one of my what i'm driving at is could i just pull up and get six up to six bottles of wine from one of these restaurants and leave so it becomes a sort of a de facto liquor store representative melton thank you madam chair and um i can understand the concern confusion and concern around that so currently if you were to go to a restaurant that selled wine and you purchased the bottle and you wanted to say take an extra bottle home i mean you drink this bottle we allow for up to one bottle right now per person so that person could exit out of the restaurant or i'm sorry that person can purchase their bottle have a half a glass poured have it re-corked they're not subject to open container laws currently because of the way the current law is written um so they could then travel this actually would alleviate even questions about having it opened by having it sold as corked in terms of becoming a de facto liquor store i believe that that is an inaccurate description in that and that if you were to okay if you were to go into a restaurant and say decide to purchase six bottles most of the time normally one the hotel's prices are going to be much higher than the prices of a liquor store their selection is not going to be as high as a liquor store so it and on top of it it's only wine we're not talking about beer nor are we talking about hard alcohol so i can't really say that i see that as the same thing and saying it's a de facto liquor store given that um given those those criteria representative rosenthal thank you madam chair and since uh representative melton did bring up amendment three are we am i allowed to ask him a question about it yes please proceed representative rosenthal thank you madam chair and so uh when you're saying a licensee may allow a person under 21 of age to enter or be present so um so that's that's like if uh okay and i i think i'm probably just answering my question but you know basically it's like a family comes in you know dad or mom is buying those bottles okay so i i think i answered i was just wanted to think through the process and i did thank you thank you madam jeric representative representative melton thank you madam chair and again that language is the language of that amendment is only to conform with another piece of legislation that's currently going through its legislative process we wanted to make sure that this bill fell uh compliant with that bill um should that bill not pass this amendment actually is meaningless but if that bill does pass we wanted to make sure that we were being compliant representative rosenthal thank you and so what if there's like a a gift shop you know like you go to um like say uh there's like a a restaurant attached to a hotel that has a little gift shop where you can buy like hats and t-shirts and they have some wine there too is is that also included like or or is it or is it just what you can buy at the restaurant itself or is that not a distinction without a difference representative melton thank you madam chair so you would not be able to purchase this within the hotel's gift shop and i know that that's also been a concern that's been floated out there the reason why is because you can't serve alcohol within that gift shop a hotel restaurant license only applies to the restaurant portion of that hotel and so since the gift shop's not in the restaurant you would not be able to now that doesn't preclude uh being able to necessarily say have a stand that's right next to the bar that has sealed bottles so that way people can see what wines are available but it does not permit the retail sale so where you're in a gift shop and there may be magnets and t-shirts it wouldn't wouldn't apply to that type of venue representative thank you madam chair actually representative arndt asked my question representative nordberg thank you ma'am chair and representative rosenthal kind of touched on my question but with respect to the the sales so it'd be more or less a retail kiosk in the restaurant or i think the language in the bill is a specifically designated area within the licensed premises so that would be within the restaurant itself or would that be anywhere else in the hotel i just i'm curious about the term specifically designated area representative melton thank you manager and um that would be the restaurant because i believe that conforms with uh some current law or current language and statute that uh wine can or drinks or alcoholic beverages couldn't be sold like at the front desk or at the uh or in the gift shop it would have to be within the space of say the hotel restaurant basically representative rosenthal thank you and what about uh how does this affected by say legislation that we currently have the books where say a person is a bit tipsy they already have that open bottle of wine and say they're walking you know they want to say not only just bring that open bottle with them but they want to purchase some more what obligations does the restaurant have to say you know what you're already bringing home this half full bottle and i'm not going to be selling you way more than that does this run into any other legislation on the books on that representative melton thank you madam chair i think i know where you're going in terms of uh say a person's overserved in the restaurant um this i don't believe would apply in the same way that say if they drank like six bottles in the restaurant and decided that they wanted to purchase another six i believe that actually i'm sorry i believe that actually the law would apply because they've already been served and so they wouldn't be able to be served further and therefore wouldn't be able to purchase additional alcohol from that establishment representative wist thank you madam chair i want to go in a slightly different direction representative melton because it appears to me that we're adding another layer of regulation here or at least a different layer of regulation in the sense that you've introduced the term wine expanded permit to our our state's laws we already have uh licenses that would apply to these facilities so this seems like a double layer of regulation and also injects some potential confusion in terms of the distinction between a permit and a license so if you could explain that for me i'd sure appreciate it representative melton thank you madame turn actually i feel like uh this bill deregulates um in many ways because under the current license they're not allowed to sell a cork bottle of alcohol with this permit they are now actually allowed to we're just saying that uh well we're just basically expanding upon the current license with an additional permit to allow uh allow these folks to do something that they couldn't previously do representative west thank you madam chair um representative melton i respectfully disagree with that because i if i'm not mistaken wouldn't the restaurant if it's serving alcohol already have a liquor license representative melton thank you madam chair they do have a liquor license but they're not allowed to sell corked bottles of bottles of wine so currently they can serve a bottle of wine if they uncork it pour it and re-cook it this now allows them to sell a bottle of wine without having to do that middle process so in my opinion uh by expanding what they can do actually deregulates what is currently in law under the license that they currently have representative thank you madam chair well are there are there current regulations that that prescribe what a permittee can do versus a licensee because you are creating a new category um and i'm assuming that you would you'd be promulgating regulations which would apply to a permittee versus a licensee because the way the bill reads and unless i'm mistaken you are creating two separate classifications a licensee as well as a permittee for this new category that you're creating representative melton thank you man of chair um no the current license is already in law so we're not creating the license we're creating a permit that can be added on to the license so you could almost think of it as having you can almost think of it as as having a driver's license and then having a cdl license on top of your driver's license so one that will allow you to drive a normal car and then one that would allow you to drive say a semi truck this would allow the restaurant additional abilities through a permit that's added on top of their current license representative thank you madam chair so with the same regulations that apply for the issuance of the license also apply to the permit because that's that's not clear to me based on your description sounds like there would be no new regulations um but that's not clear given the fact that you're clearly creating a separate category called wine expanded uh a wine expanded permit representative melton thank you madam chair and i believe that there are no there are no additional requirements on top of the license that they currently have they just have to apply for the additional permit representative west thank you manager i hate to belabor this representative melton then why create the new classification why create a new layer of regulation and a new category of regulation representative melton thank you manager because the current license doesn't permit them to do this now so we have to create something to then we have to create a new class that actually deregulates something that the current class prohibits representative navarro thank you madam chair i have a question in regards to your bill versus what is regulated for wineries what's the difference as far as i'm you uncork it you taste it you buy representative melton thank you madam chair i i personally don't know the current regulations on wineries um i would probably think that there's not i'm sorry well if with the winery in your example if they're uncorking and then pouring and then re-quirking that's actually in par with what we currently have with all restaurants my bill would uh remove that step of corking and allow for the bottle to just be purchased without uncorking representative navarro so then the next question i have with that is you don't have to uncork it you can just go in and buy up to six bottles of wine you don't have to taste it you don't have to have any other interaction just kind of go in and buy your six bottles and leave or is it melting thank you madam chair uh that's correct and again the reason why especially we're limited just to the hotel industry is because most like i say coming from the hotel industry many hotels are removing many bars from their rooms or you may have a traveler who maybe has to go to a dinner party or something and not familiar with the area wants to bring a bottle of wine and isn't aware if there's any liquor store that's nearby it's more of a convenience for people who may be visiting and touring our state so that's why i say this is more of a tourism bill as opposed to in my opinion a bill that would compete against a normal liquor store or should a larger build get past the liquor store slash grocery store okay representative navarro okay so with your experience how much more training are businesses going to have to put their employees through to make sure that they clearly understand the new law versus the old law and make sure they're staying within the boundaries of buying and selling alcohol and also will this prevent one restaurant or winery to sell to another restaurant or winery representative melton thank you madam chair i don't believe it would have any impact on your second question between another restaurant and another winery um i mainly because this is dealing more so with uh the interaction between a restaurant and its consumer uh to answer your first question coming from the industry i wouldn't be uh very much training at all most people who are qualified to serve alcohol go through extensive training this would just be one additional bit of information that they would have in terms of being able to sell without corking it or uncorking representative thurlow thank you madam chair thank you representative melton uh i think i want to try the whisked question one more time in a different way though it seems like the hotel liquor license like why couldn't that law just be changed to allow taking a full bottle still with the cork unit out of the the hotel why do we have to have a different category which even though the fiscal note is small it's still going to cost 25 000 a year couldn't we just change the wording of that liquor license category for hotels representative melton thank you madam chair i believe the reason why we did it this way was because we wanted uh to give the option well i guess if there were specific hotels that wanted to be able to sell wine as opposed to some that didn't um to have that additional permit added on so in case there was a hotel that said you know we don't want to go into this practice and and therefore um not necessarily have our license changed in this way um but i might want to defer to our bill drafter to see if i'm correct on that legal aspect or if this was more so a legal requirement to be able to do representative nordberg thank you madam chair and represent melton i'm happy to ask the department to i just want to make sure since we're we're creating something new with the same standards transfer over so for instance um underage liquor sales would the punishment be there for this limited retail kiosk how would that work it was in melton thank you madam chair um yes it would still fall in compliance with state and federal law uh which is why we actually are going to introduce them in l001 we were trying to um re-explain that or reconfirm that in lines three through 13 on page three of the original bill however we were told that that was actually redundant to state law so you're correct um state law would apply to this bill even without that section in it representative garnett thank you madam chair and just uh representative west and norberg and thurlow i saw mr moroney from the liquor enforcement division in the department of revenue here who i think is can you answer a lot of these questions since they're kind of diving into technical questions about different licenses and can we change those licenses to do different things representative west thank you madam chair i think that would be a good idea these are some technical questions regarding current state law and this i think would be helpful to hear mr moroney's responses to some of these questions committee are there any further general questions to the bill for our sponsor there being none we will now move into the witness testimony phase and representative melton currently you have one two in opposition one in support and mr moroney for technical questions only how would you like to proceed uh if we can start with opposition first all right thank you we'll have mr thomas neller thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent my name is thomas noller and i'm the owner of mayfair liquors in denver please proceed with your testimony um well i'm nervous so it'll take me a bit you are not in a court of law just relax it feels like there's a lot of eyes out there i'm out of my element make yourself at home um it seems to me that there's really no need for this sort of a bill um it creates another competitor to my business i don't know the bill i've not read it but it i don't know that it addresses the pricing aspect but it was referred to that restaurants are more expensive and we know that but they could create a second list that is for to-go wines so maybe they become more competitive at retail pricing because they're drawing they're having the ability to sell up to six bottles at a time that aren't court so they can go anywhere i also am led to believe that this doesn't prevent people from customers coming in off the street you know if they live next to a hotel and it's nearer than a liquor store then they would go to the hotel if they had a nice price on it as opposed to the restaurant price and it seems to me you know my industry is under a big attack this year and has been for a number of years and my store has been in my family since my dad bought it in march of 1959. i've been at the store since 1977 so i've got 38 years and it's been in my family for 57 years and i thought all along that this would be my retirement plan but i'm at risk of losing all of that investment of time and energy into uh all these attacks these little chips that you know individually maybe there's not such a big risk with this bill but then there's another bill and then there's another bill and we're small business people we're local colorado people and i don't want to get off track on the other stuff but every time we give up a little bit what do we get back we don't get anything and i'm i'm [Music] frankly kind of tired of it and it's expensive it's prevented me from investing into my business i have a small business building i would like to expand but i'm not willing to spend the money and have it taken away from me at a stroke of a pen or a ballot so um yeah i've supported a lot of people over the years my family my parents both deceased my family my kids my grandkids now they all derive some benefit from my business and my uh plan so again i'm deviating here so i should stop and let anybody ask questions i guess no thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions of this witness representative rupee thank you madam chair and thank you mr noller for being here um it's i'm actually very pleased that you're here to testify on this particular bill um in a liquor store you have a wide variety of different products that you could provide uh including wine and this is particularly saying wine can you give me a sense of how much of your sales are wine sales compared to the rest of your inventory between mr nolan i'm sorry excuse me okay thank you madam chair um between 40 and 45 percent is wine sales um lately uh with the boom in whiskey and bourbons the spirits have risen a little bit they were kind of declining representative rosenthal thank you sir for coming in uh and testifying so um i know i'm asking a lot for you to maybe break down as to the the level of of the wine so is it mostly wines that are zero to ten dollars 10 to 20 20 to 40 because it seems to me you know if you're going to go to a restaurant oftentimes it's wines that are in the 10 to 20 range whereas maybe your biggest market are the folks from 0 to 10. i'm just sort of throwing that out there wondering if this is really the case or or what your take on that is mr noller thank you madam chair um it is difficult office off the cuff to say what that is most people are looking for wines that are affordable to drink every day we sell one of the biggest categories is box wines at home however we have a wine cellar that has wines all the way up to 2 500 they don't sell particularly well but we have them the vast majority of our sales i would say are between i'll say 12 to 30 dollars somewhere in that vicinity and i know that's a lot less than restaurants which is a whole different uh pricing scheme and i understand that but if the restaurant or if the hotel license is not having to serve it all they're doing is stocking the wines putting them in a bag to go i could envision them having a more retail like price structure for that purpose since you're not consuming in the restaurant representative navarro thank you madam chair so the question i asked before do you see that this bill would prevent restaurant and wines selling to another restaurant in wine or do you how do you see that fit into this mr noller thank you madam chair um as i understand the colorado liquor code doesn't allow uh sales from one one one licensee to another with some exception i believe i'm allowed to sell to a restaurant up to two thousand dollars a year essentially uh to fill the gap you know you run out of grand marnier on the weekend and you need something for your bar so you're allowed to get a bottle it's not meant to stock your your license but also it's illegal to sell from a third party you have you're required to buy from the licensed wholesaler in the three-tier system is that what you needed thank you representative west thank you madam chair sir thank you for being here as a as a liquor licensee are you required to have any permits or does the term permit mean anything to you in the context of regulation of your business mr noller thank you madam chair um i believe the only permit that i can think of is a permit to sell ice and possibly a permit for delivery um we at one time we had to apply to deliver outside of the store and i'm not sure even if that applies any longer or whether we're just licensed year to year because we do deliver occasionally but not often so hopefully mr moroney doesn't nick me for that if i'm not compliant but just give me a call and make me get compliant yes representative garnett thank you madam sharon thank you mr miller for your testimony you're doing a great job you can tell by the number of questions people are asking that your testimony is really important is there a limit on the number of bottles that you can sell to a customer mr noller thank you madam chair i don't believe there is um going back in history since i've been there 38 years i believe there used to be a restriction on the quantity that i could sell to one person before i became a wholesaler but i don't know if that exists any longer and quite honestly i don't have people coming to my place since i'm not a big store like applejack or argonaut that are coming in getting wheeler fulls or truckloads of products so i don't know that it applies thank you committee are there any further questions of our witness there being none you did great next time you'll do better we appreciate you being here thank you our next witness is jeannie mcavoy thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent madam chairman members of the committee and representative melton my name is gene mcavoy i'm the executive director of the colorado licensed beverage association and that is the association of liquor stores in colorado there's 1 650 current licensees in that neighborhood and i'm here to testify against this particular piece of legislation house bill 16 1452 and i do understand the desire of many hotels to eliminate the many bars i can see what kind of a problem that that has been over the years for them and they would like to continue to be able to provide quality and frequently requested services to their patrons and i think this is just maybe the wrong way in which to change modality here and the reason why is many of you have smart phones today and i there are many of our members who contract with companies such as drizzly or liquor limo and ebay or amazon or you name it and you can have alcohol delivered to where you are in about 15 minutes and so i think that there is some avenues currently in place that are allowed by colorado statute and very popular with the patrons who come from other places to stay at the hotels the problem i see with is not this particular proponent who would like to see the change in the legislation but the expansion of this particular concept i think ripley melton said there were approximately 100 hotels with h r licenses h r stands for hotel and restaurant license there's about 5 000 of those in colorado and most restaurants have a hotel and restaurant license and so if it becomes popular for the hotels with restaurants we anticipate it's going to be just as popular for a lot of other folks who say maybe we should get a wine permit as well under this legislation they wouldn't be able to do that but what starts out today as a small idea germinates very quickly in the liquor industry the there isn't hardly any place in colorado if you spun a cat you wouldn't hit a liquor store they're very very frequent they're very very close to many businesses here in denver if you go to lodo there's approximately five or six liquor stores in that general vicinity and most of those liquor stores have relationships business relationships with hotels the hotel calls up and says we need we have a customer who wants prisoner we have a customer who wants chateaubriand we want a customer who wants these and it's it's taken care of very very quickly so a couple things that i've heard that i wanted to just clarify along with being the executive i am one of the private we have a responsible vendor training program with the responsible vendor training program is not required by the state of colorado but most licensees whether they're on-premise or off-premise desire to train their employees so they do not sell to the intoxicated customer and i think it's very important to know that one of the things that we have to teach her what are the laws and regulations that you have to follow here in colorado and i'm at the amendment that takes out the iding i think that is an appropriate amendment should this bill go forward but let me tell you what the the law says or does not say about checking ids you do not as a retailer whether you are a restaurateur a liquor store or any other kind of licensee you do not have to ask that patron for an id that patron does not have to show you their id but if you sell to a miner you're going to be heavily sanctioned so having the requirement of checking ids just doesn't seem to be necessary because most of the compliance the compliance is very high here in colorado and we're very happy to say that but the the problem we have with the uh current piece of legislation is that it's just not needed because you can provide that service now one of the problems and a permit the liquor store who has a retail liquor license it and to sell for off-premise consumption that means they sell things in sealed containers they are bound by reams and reams of legislation so now we're saying to this particular group of licensees well let's add a service that we're going to put upon you and it's different than what you're providing now and the regulations for liquor stores are different than the regulations for restaurants but because you're getting a permit to sell off-premise sealed containers sorry you don't you're not bound by all these regulations that your competitors are bound by and the situation of anybody off the street who walks by the hotel let's pretend we're in aspen for a minute you walk by the jerome hotel and jerome hotel whether or not i don't i think they have an h r license and you go on the jerome hotel it's very popular and you see this little kiosk of wine oh i want to take a bottle of wine home to my family which i think is a great idea but they ought to be bound by the if they're going to sell what a liquor store sells they ought to be bound by the same set of regulations and the same sanctions and the h r license doesn't have the same sanctions you can't on on a liquor store you have a you can't have an open bottle they all have to be sealed but we're making exception here so what is the next exception that comes along and i understand that the the fewer regulations is always better but this is the most highly regulated industry more and i'm doing a lot of this for the new legislators that i haven't had the opportunity to present to before we're more highly regulated than nuclear power there's more regulations on liquor stores and liquor licensees and so to take this one group of licensees and say we've decided that you're special and you don't have to be bound by all these regulations that your competitors do so we find it a very uneven playing field and i'm going to be quiet now and answer any questions you might have committee do we have any questions of our sponsor representative west thank you madam chair and picking up on your your last point don't you think it's logical that eventually we would have a set of regulations for permitees that would that could potentially conflict with the regulations for licensees uh therefore creating different category categories creating confusion because i certainly don't think that we're going to create a category and not promote regulations i think it's inevitable that that we usually go in that direction so before we go in that direction and create this category don't you think it's wise that that we pause and think about that before we create the category ms mcavoy madam chairman uh representative west i think it's always wise to give a lot of consideration to a change you're going to make to an industry and whether i'm not a big fan i'm not a big fan of permits not with a controlled substance like alcohol a controlled substance ought to have a very clear concise this is what you can do this is what you can't do and there shouldn't be any avenues for well we didn't mean it over here so if i i hope i answered your question committee are there any further questions of this witness representative melton thank you madam chair it's not really a question i just want to make sure i cleared something up i did say 146 and that wasn't accurate however um there are according to the fiscal note on page two the first paragraph there are 4 962 h r licenses however only 324 of those licenses would be would be eligible for this permit so it's not like 5 000 new permits could go out truthfully at most 324 could and the fiscal analysts had um assumed that 146 would apply so this is again a very small number and a very narrow field thank you representative melton representative rupee uh thank you madam chair um thank you for being here i was so in this fiscal note that representative melton was referring to it says there's the 4962 and assumes that 292 will apply for the permit 146 will apply in one year and then the rest of the year does it does it make sense to say that all of these folks wouldn't at some point in time want to apply for this miss mcavoy madam chairman representative rupay the way the bill is written representing melton is correct if you are not a hotel business with an h r license this wouldn't apply to you so let's i i'll get my restaurants mixed up but please bear with me you have the um hotels down in lodo that could take advantage of this if there wasn't a liquor store within a thousand i think it's a thousand feet so pretend for a minute that you have a hotel who could take advantage of this fermented but you got a really nice restaurant about two blocks away and they can't take advantage of offering their guests and their patrons who may be out of town tourists as well they can't offer this same buy a bottle to go because they're not a hotel so pretty soon you're going to see the indus the restaurant tours in colorado say gee i'd like to do that too and then they will come back and pretty soon you're going to have those 4962. who think this is a great idea as well thank you committee are there any further questions of this witness there being none thank you for being with us today thank you kevin bomber thank you for appearing today please state your name and who you represent thank you madam chair members of the committee kevin baumer at the colorado municipal league i will be extraordinarily brief i've been working with the proponents of this legislation representative melton mentioned if i may madam chair l004 the league is currently opposed but would drop our opposition with that amendment and because that does as was stated recognize the the dual licensing nature in addition to that and maybe by the time you actually consider the amendment um there will be a a little different dollar amount in there um the the license or the permit fee that is uh that was inserted in there's 150 i actually suggested half of that um the licensing or permit fee really is at the local level not a relevant issue and let me tell you why briefly an interesting nuance in our constitution requires local governments to take the licensing fees that they receive and turn around and write a check for 85 percent of that amount amount to the state old age pension fund so trying to have higher local licensing fees really doesn't do anything and in this case i think the same amount that would be required for the state permit would be adequate for the local permit so if that is change you'll likely see a new amendment number with that amount and that's certainly fined by us one thing and and i think previous witnesses touched on this and this is not going to be an issue that um uh directly directly affects our going to a no position if the amendment is adopted but i think it's worth pointing out we also asked for in the introduced version of the bill on page 2 line 14 and page 2 lines 23 and 24 to strike the off-premise portion uh of the of the permit let me tell you why uh it's at least an important policy issue for for the committee to consider um there's a pretty bright line that exists right now between on-premise permits and off-premise permits and in talking to the proponents i understand that you know the the case that they make for uh well this is different because in the restaurant they could just cork a bottle of wine that they've ordered and take and take it out that's allowed under state law but in terms of the license and in this case the permit that would be uh at state and local option allowed to be added to the license it is still an on-premise license and so this would add an off-premise component to it that it would be unique as compared to any other on-premise license so i think that's that's something to consider um as we are in sort of the the wild west of beer and liquor licensing and and issues and legislation and proposals and initiatives here in colorado um it at least is worth considering whether or not we maintain that bright line between on and off premise licenses um madam chair that's the extent of my testimony i'm happy to answer any questions thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions of this witness there be none thank you for being with us today next we'll have peter karpinski thank you for appearing today please state your name and who you represent for the record uh thank you for having me my name is peter karpinski i'm a partner at a company in town called sage hospitality we're a denver based hotel developer owner and management company we have quite a few businesses here in colorado and we have a number of hotels across the country please proceed with your testimony um we're we are obviously in support um of the extension of um an existing bill here um for a couple different reasons one is that in our business particularly on the development of new hotels in colorado and the states that we work in we've seen the hotel business evolve and transform in many ways over the last several years and it's becoming more and more competitive we're finding ourselves in an environment where in order to continue to give our hotel guests quality services at a fair price we are eliminating multiple departments in full-service hotels that normally people would be used to not just minibar we're also eliminating room service and we're eliminating gift shops and in order for us to continue to develop new properties and provide the guests that we have with us what they need in a in a reasonable fair and quick way this this allows us to do just just that from our from our restaurant businesses without adding any um undue costs or overhead to the businesses that they currently can't afford today if we were going to do that another reason that we are in support of this is that you know as we continue to invest in hotel development developments across the country we want to continue to be able to do that in our home state of colorado where we have more hotels in any other state but most of the development we've had over the last several years in this business cycle have been outside of colorado for a number of reasons this being one of them um and and i don't think this bill and we're not our intention was not to add a new layer of regulation but we're really just taking a lead on what other states are already offering and what we've already experienced as a business developer and owner in other parts of the country we were able to do this in a business of ours outside of detroit michigan with great success it had very little impact to no impact on any other businesses outside of what i'll call our four walls and what our hotel guests really were looking for or our regular customers and we have a business of this nature that's under construction in savannah georgia that our firm and our investor partners have decided to invest in and this is one of the components of it we've been able to do this in chicago illinois and we've been able to do this throughout california um so we we would we were we're currently looking at a couple large-scale development projects here in colorado one here in denver and one up in fort collins and this is an important um variable in our our decision making and whether or not we're going to be able to invest in those projects and continue to serve our guests the way that we would like to when they come from out of town and stay with us as representative melton said as tourists thank you thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions of this witness representative rubin thank you madam chair and thank you for being here mr karkinski um would you given that you we heard some earlier testimony from mcavoy would you have any objections to doing a full license with all of the regulations just like a regular liquor store would be in order to do the expanded wine sales because what we were hearing earlier is that they would have an uneven playing field so would you be willing to take on those extra steps mr karpinski thank you man i'm sure yes that's a great question we absolutely would um we're we're used to having to live under very good sound liquor regulations here in colorado and across the country and speaking for our organization we would be able to handle that capacity thank you mr karpinski you mentioned that other states have passed laws similar to these do you know how many states have passed this um that's a good question i'm sure i don't know the answer to exactly how many states have passed it i can only refer to the states that we've done business in in this regard in states that we're currently looking at doing business and early are those well we did [Music] michigan georgia illinois california currently thank you representative garnett thank you madam sharon thank you mr karpinski for being here can you describe what you currently do now if a bottle of wine is called down from uh from a room for example mr karpinski that's a that's a good question and this is really one of the reasons that when we're trying to clear a path just to make it a little bit easier for our hotel guests where in the past they would you be able to easily order that from room service and have it delivered to the rooms or order it from their mini bar today that that guest would have to leave the room come all the way downstairs come into the restaurant figure out a way to find a bartender server look at the list order a bottle of wine uncork that bottle of wine record that bottle of wine and then for them to bring it up to the room so this is really just a an easier way for us to be able to serve those guests in a less complicated manner thank you committee are there any further questions of this witness representative sias thank you madam chair so sir if i'm following this correctly then would you be willing to have this only available for guests at your hotel mr karpinski that that's a really good question you know our primary purpose is is for our hotel guests we also do have restaurants in our hotels and there and they're really built to serve those full service needs we do have guests that come to our restaurants as well that live and work and play in the communities that we do business in this would our view on this was that really for regular customers of ours that would be coming into the restaurant and if they did want to buy a bottle that they enjoyed drinking of wine only no beer nor nor liquor nor large quantities they would be able to bring that bottle home with them we we didn't we don't view that in any competition with other offerings for guests whether it's delivery or whether it's liquor stores primarily because our selections are so limited in quantity and quite frankly our prices are so high the prices that we have to charge in hotels just to break even um on a bottle of wine is is um is is very high so that customer would would want to be paying a premium to have that privilege representative thank you madam chair so are the prices that you would charge in the store or this kiosk the same as the prices that you would charge in the restaurant um yes sir that's a great question and the prices would be exactly the same so whatever prices we're charging in the in the restaurant would also be the same prices we would charge for that bottle of wine from that same restaurant representative thank you madam chair and the selection in the kiosk would only be bottles that are on the the menu in the restaurant yes sir that is correct thank you representative arndt thank you madam chair so um i was just listening to talk about liquor and beer so if the logic applies for wine why wouldn't the logic also apply for beer and liquor that you'd be serving your guests better that they're already there that it's convenient that they like it that you'd like to sell it um yeah that's a that's a great question ma'am our view on it really was because our guests are primarily looking for the consumption of wine they're not they're not they're not looking to order as much liquor or beer and if we we were going to sell them that liquor or beer particularly liquor that the cost would be even more prohibitive representative melton thank you madam chair and even just also add on uh this bill was also intended to mirror current law so you can't purchase a beer and have it resealed or you can't purchase um say a bottle of scotch and have that reskill sealed out of a restaurant and exit onto the street but you can with wine so this is just removing um honestly an honor a step in our current law thank you committee are there any further questions of this witness there being none thank you for being with us today thank you for having me and committee now i'm going to bring up patrick moroney so that we can get the technical questions answered is mr moroney in the room thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent uh yeah thank you madam chair good afternoon committee my name is patrick moroney the director of the liquor enforcement division i'm here to answer any of your questions representative wist thank you madam chair mr maroney always good to uh to see you um i uh i'm hoping you can help me with this permit versus license distinction mr maroney thank you madam chair i'm glad to representative west first of all the term license is defined by statute is just give give someone the ability to sell alcohol manufacture alcohol you know so the distinction between a permanent license is not necessarily black and white there are some permits that allow more than other permits the idea of a permit i think was just language that's been used throughout the years from different legislations sometimes they call it a permit sometimes i call it a license they're somewhat interchangeable there are some permits that are a little bit less regulated but they're not really they're all bound by the same laws service to youth over service all the trade practice violations all the things that we look at for a permit or the same as a license they're both you know but there are certain privileges that a permit may not be bound to that a license is you know but like for example a bed and breakfast permit a bed and breakfast permanent is somewhat limited a bed and breakfast permit does not allow the person that holds that license to sell alcohol but just offer it with a meal okay an art gallery permit is a permit that our gallery can use to just provide alcohol not sell it by the drink to patrons of the art gallery but then you have a special event permit it allows a non-profit to either sell alcohol or give it away during events so it's really hit or miss when it comes to what they can and cannot do but they are all bound by the regulations of public safety regulations trade rights regulations representative wisk thank you madam chair mr murray i appreciate that explanation so for each of those permits that you just identified there are regulations that specifically provide notice to those permittees as to what the expectations are for them to hold that permit right mr maroney thank you man i'm sure absolutely yeah they're well defined by either rule and or law both representative thank you madam chair so as we're creating a new permit here isn't it logical to assume that new regulations would follow mr marroney thank you i'm chair i would definitely expect that yes committee are there any further questions or technical questions representative navarro thank you madam chair what is the current cost to hold a liquor license or permit mr maroney thank you madam chair it really depends on which kind it is that's all over the board uh wine a wine permit for limited wineries as low as 70 dollars per minute or a license for a distillery is 1050. so it is they're all across the board as far as what the the cost for the licenses and permits are committee do you have any further technical questions representative art thank you madam chair um i'm just learning a lot today uh so could you please address the uh mr bomber's comments about the on the help me with the words the on-premise license an off-premise license and the conflicting con did you hear mr palmer yeah thank you did you mind just addressing his comment actually thank you ma'am chair traditionally of course tradition uh within liquor law in colorado for many provisions prohibition has been you either sell alcohol for on-premise consumption or off-premises and those have not been blurred a whole lot until some of the new manufacturer license such as limited winery license a distillery license those license do have a little bit of retail privileges that sell on and off premises as a manufacturer but all the retail outlets you see out there restaurants hotels you know taverns those kind of are strictly on premise only our retail liquor stores are limited to off-premises only and miss mcavoy is correct they they can't even have an open bottle of alcohol and you know you can't be the owner and join a sip of a beer behind the counter while you're selling your alcohol representative art thank you so i mean you know i understand the convenience and i i see that you know it's last year we passed the corking thing and it seems you know okay so you can buy a court on court so now you just buy it uncorked it just seems i get the logic there but really we're setting up a fundamentally new thing here by crossing and blurring that bright line is that true mr mabroni ma'am chair thank you yes this does change a long-standing practice of how alcohol has been sold in colorado thank you committee are there any further technical questions for mr moroney yes mr marroney i'm sure if you would i took some notes while i was sitting in the back and some of the questions were asked i'm glad to answer those if you'd like to because some that weren't re-asked if you like please proceed a question about room service currently if a hotel and restaurant licensee includes the rooms as part of their licensed premises they're allowed to sell to room service to someone in the room as long as they uncork it all right so the patron does not have to go downstairs and get it they can actually have it delivered to them but it does have to be unsealed before given to the customer a second of all um several hotels or liquor license premise is the whole hotel because a lot of them have conference rooms they serve alcohol so of course you have to license the hallways so it's all contiguous so you can you could conceivably have your own room a gift shop just by itself selling bottles of wine with a spill so i want to make this sure that's clear um as far as the restriction of what could be sold in this new room versus what's in the menu i don't see any provision the law that you can sell any kind of wine in this new off-premises sales room you won't call it that that was purchased from a wholesaler the law does not say that it has to be on the menu so we'll make sure those those distinctions are there uh thank you madam chair and sir just to follow up there is there anything here regarding the relative pricing of what is uh sold in the store versus what's sold in the restaurant mr maroney thank you manager you know colorado law and rules are are silent on any kind of pricing uh the pricing can be is whatever the the retailer wants to sell that product at there's no there's no minimum maximum representative thank you madam church so you could have a a bottle of wine sold for one price in the restaurant and the same bottle of wine sold for a different price in the kiosk then mr maroney ma'am sure thank you representative that's true thank you sir representative nordberg thank you ma'am sharon just real quick mr moroney um how will the violation for underage liquor cells be treated with this concept mr moroney um thank you madam chair the way the bill is currently written when you have um the person that's been seller server trained or it's no different it could be actually a bit aggravated in this case if you've had uh if you're a manager of a of an establishment we actually hold you to a higher standard and you'll get more of a suspension so it but it's definitely not any less than any other place thank you thank you committee are there any further questions of mr moroney thank you for being here today you're welcome thank you committee that ends our testimony on house bill 16 1452 is there anyone else in the room who would like to testify on house bill 16 1452 there being none we're going to close the witness testimony phase and house bill 16 14 52 will be laid over for action only representative melton thank you for being with us today and we look forward to the continued conversation committee our next spill up is house bill 16 1455 metropolitan football stadium district administration with representative pabong do the way i hope representative pabon brought us some bronco shades no madam chair i brought you something much better than broncos oh great i brought you house bill 1455. representative pabone tell us about your bill thank you madam chair members this is a bill that deals with the topic that affects nearly every person in the state of colorado and it affects not only their uh overall demeanor days can be moods can be dictated by uh what happens uh what occurs in the location talked about in 1455 but it can set a tone and a feeling for what we celebrate um almost every sunday between august and january and what i'm talking about is what we now call sports authority stadium at mile high but as i've distributed here all today to all the members you've seen the headlines the headlines came out yesterday sports authority throws in the towel and what that means is uncertain and i'll admit that as the sponsor the bill it doesn't clear what that means for our beloved stadium and and and uh what will happen with those naming rights but as timing would have it and it's time to have the discussion about how important the term mile high is to not only the legislature but the taxpayers of colorado who funded the building of the stadium so i have before you fort house bill 1455 it deals with four issues and i'll touch briefly on the three issues and then talk about the fourth issue uh in 1999 uh the stadium district was created uh because our stadium mile high stadium as it was known was needed to be replaced it couldn't accommodate the number of fans and simply wasn't able to be upgraded and so we went to the voters in 1999 and say please provide or please um let's create a stadium tax district and please pitch in towards the building of a new stadium at that time it was a six-county referendum and it passed now if you remember in 1999 it was a good year for us uh it was just off our second super bowl win uh ever in the history of the denver broncos and so fans were excited about supporting the demo broncos as they are now so it's amazing how history can repeat itself what didn't exist in 1999 was the county city and county of broomfield and so one of the things that the bill does is says that the city and county broomfield shall now have a seat as part of the metropolitan stadium district since we added one seat and in order to keep an odd number on the board and not an odd number of not odd in that sense but uh uh odd in the um numeral sense we needed to add a second appointee and so the governor's office now has a second appointee the other piece of this is that there's term limits uh on the board members terms to allow uh both uh recognition that this is a very very desirable um appointment and to give folks an opportunity to serve you know two terms which is eight years and then allow another uh board member to be appointed uh and then finally last but not least it says that if there's any new sponsorship changes to the stadium that the words mile high shall remain in any new sponsorship agreement that's house bill 1455 in a nutshell and we ask for your support on behalf of not just again your constituents but your tax paying bronco fan supporters who recognize that mile high is a tradition of our state of our city in fact as i said before for 40 years almost 40 years the stadium was actually called mile high stadium was owned by the city of denver now as taxpayers we want to again give plenty of flexibility but say that tradition should be preserved recommendation thank you for that wonderful introduction representative pabon and i just want to remind you that it's 10 till 4. and you know what that means to the business committee [Laughter] so i wish you best on passing your piece of legislation representatives well thank you madam chair and representative thank you for bringing this i am supportive i just want to make sure that you can uh reassure the members of the committee that this initiative has nothing to do with uh colorado constitution amendment 64. representative thank you madam chair and as all of us know mile the mile high city was known as the mile high city far before amendment 64 ever passed thank you very much sir representative garnett uh thank you madam chair and uh thank you representative pabon for taking the lead on this issue it really is uh one that um i'm super excited about and i know that uh constituents across my district are going to be excited about you know a lot of things came over from the original mile high stadium to the new mile high stadium the horseshoe shape the south stands uh the thirteen thousand five hundred tons of steel that create the rocky mountain thunder bucky or bucko which is the denver icon that still has its lofty perch above the stadium on the scoreboard in the ring of fame i think making sure mile high is in the name is really really important but another thing that i know is important are the colors of orange and blue would you be willing to accept a conceptual amendment to make sure that going forward orange and blue are the colors on the stadium because the sports authority logo though i don't want to kick them while they're down reminding me of the kansas city chiefs and uh and the nebraska huskers and so i think that's an important piece to maintaining the tradition of the denver broncos representative thank you um madam chair and i think it's a a fine suggestion but i think it's actually important to make the distinction uh so the taxpayers own the stadium but we don't own the denver broncos and so we don't want and this doesn't impinge on the denver broncos or you know the owners or the team in any way we don't we don't want to do that we want them to win and focus on winning and and um i think they're committed um i can't speak for them but i'm i'm fairly certain that orange and blue is in their future representative pabon if if we your piece of legislation is passed and i'm sure you've been speaking with the broncos can you guarantee us another super bowl championship yeah let's do a conceptual amendment on that you know if we wanted to you know invite you know john elway to testify in front of the committee i'm sure we could do that you can arrest your authority all right representative garnett thank you man i'm cheering just one follow-up because i know uh uh john always listening to this right now because there's nothing else going on today that he's worried about uh the draft and you know the first round pick the broncos um well i hope i hope that the denver broncos are listening loud and clear that the the people of colorado want to make sure that the colors on the stadium uh remain orange and blue because i know i hear about that all the time representing rosenthal uh thank you madam chair uh a couple a couple of things i wanted to sort of bring up one is and i'm looking at the the metropolitan football stadium district website and assuming that this is still accurate um i'm noticing of all the appointees i'm a little concerned about some of the diversity that's on there there's only one woman who is on this board um so if you don't mind uh speaking to that and then also i'm looking no i'm serious boards and commissions should be diverse and i think that is that it's really critical that um this is something that for those who are going to be appointing future people um it is important that we have that kind of diversity and then another thing i'd like to bring up and like to hear your comment on it is the fact that um basically all of these people will be cycled out uh they're allowed to according to your bill serve out the remainder of their term um but then we're gonna have a whole new set of people who are going to be on this board and you're not going to have that institutional memory obviously we have term limits in in the legislature and that is one of the assertions about the legislature is that we lose that institutional memory and yet this is going to be almost a wholesale change uh when all of these people are going to be gone so what what is sort of your take on the composition of the board as i brought it up representative thank you madam chair i'll take your last question first if that's okay so the good news is um and i'm not sure if the website reflects uh stephanie donner as an appointee to the stadium board so stephanie donner who was the governor's chief uh legal counsel was just actually appointed um to the board and i think um again i can't speak for the governor but maybe he sort of saw that issue and decided to just tackle it that way um so keep in mind that stephanie if you know serving at the pleasure of the governor and her appointment continues she will be on for eight years um so there will not be a wholesale changing of the board as you suggest but the important thing i think is that there is an opportunity to diversify the board over time so i'll address the first question as part of my answer which is it's an interesting dynamic because each county um gets to name its own appointee so they're sort of reflecting on what best represents that particular county the only person who really has the 30 000 foot view of how the the board looks or can influence that is really the governor um so in some ways this should add to the ability to diversify the board because the governor will have a new appointee uh three appointees instead of two thank you representative representative west thank you madam chair uh representative pavone i um i i think we all uh or most of us in our state love the broncos um and uh i don't want that issue to to sort of sidetrack us from some important concepts that i think we have to talk about and that is that that this was a taxpayer-funded stadium um which uh i think is is is a subject for some discussion in terms of taxpayer uh taxpayers funding or paying for a facility that's essentially used by a private entity certainly one that our community benefits from um but you know i'm happy to see mayor webb here who uh led the charge and i think rightfully so that because the taxpayers paid for this stadium it should have retained its name and we got this wrong originally and now we continue to perpetuate that by having our feet in both pools on the one hand we we want corporate sponsorship for this stadium but we're not really willing to say that the stadium belongs to the people and the people should be able to name the stadium what the people want to name the stadium so i have that one set of principles on the one side and then on the other side what i have here in this bill is sort of a mandate that if we sell the stadium it has to have a certain name so i like if i sell an asset it has to have a certain name so i realize representative pavone that that's sort of a mishmash and not particularly on one side or the other of this bill but i do have some concerns about the mandate given uh and the word sale does appear in in the bill if there were to be a sale of the asset would we be able to mandate that it continue to maintain that name um and also if you could comment on on uh the original name and whether or not we're perpetuating an original mistake representative uh thank you uh madam chair so i'll try to parse that um statements last question a little bit um so so first and foremost um you know that the trend in um the country um is essentially that um taxpayers um nationwide are essentially constructing and building these stadiums and part of the reason as i understand it is the economics um you know these are these are enormously expensive properties um and so you know while it could happen i think the likelihood of it happening um anytime soon of a our public property selling to a private entity um would probably be unlikely but in the event that it that it was sold um again i think considering that the taxpayers built the structure paid for it um they have the right to reserve a little something in history and again this doesn't say how prominent the word mile high must be how you know how large it must be displayed on the stadium nothing like that because we don't want to be overly prescriptive but we do want to recognize that you know as our city and our state is growing as we have a new generation of broncos fans coming into the world that they recognize where they came from and that's mile high um and so um to your other point about you know we have this public private partnership in a certain way you know i think this uh approach kind of balances the two so it again doesn't you know it's not mandating orange and blue it's not mandating that the team be called denver broncos it's not mandating anything about the sports team itself because this is bigger than that this is about the the place that um you know uh that has been sold out for i think 31 years straight plus and um that fans go and recognize that they're part of something bigger than themselves bigger than their own life and we want to make sure we enshrine that into law thank you representative pabona i'm looking at page three um lines eight through about 27 and just to understand you shared the article that sports authority is now filing for bankruptcy and so the bill says that if the stadium is renovated or a new stadium is built the board may sell the name let's say that there's a different outcome on the sports authority name that's on there and it's filed bankruptcy and so does this transfer over and if they just sell that the naming rights that it has to have mile high in the name of it in the event that sports authorities name is removed as a result of bankruptcy representative thank you madam chair yeah i mean any sale lease or other agreement affecting the name of the stadium entered into or on or after the effective date of this subsection must provide that the name of the stadium contains the phrase mile high so thank you for clarifying committee are there any further questions representing norbert thank you madam chair and representative um i guess two questions is it within the authority of the board as it stands right now to to do this to do what you're trying to accomplish without legislation and then also um i don't know have there been discussions with the board as to whether or not they're supportive of this measure or what their what their views opinions and maybe they're even somewhere here today i don't know representative thank you madam chair the answer is yes and um yes there is the authority to do this um and the stadium district thankfully um has listened to um you know the fans who've essentially um you know there's online petitions there's um you know forever mile high hashtag i mean there's there's a lot of people who are interested in this issue but they've done it by by contract and there's nothing to guarantee it in the future and so you know some of the things that we try to do in the legislature is to really put our imprint on the future and this is one way to do that secondly i haven't the chair of the stadium district and i've been playing phone tag i haven't spoken to him directly i haven't shared this with the governor's office um and they don't have any issues with it thank you committee are there any further questions of our sponsor representative rosenthal thank you madam chair and so rosanna pabone um how what's the what are the logistics once this stadium is paid off um what is the does the district just still retain authority over it or okay it does okay they retain that thank you thank you committee are there any further questions of our sponsor there being none we do have one witness signed up to testify on house bill 16 14 55 and i'd like to ask the honorable mayor wellington webb to come forward and thank you for joining us today please state your name and who you're representing for the record wellington webb representing me and this is the shortest testimony i say ditto to everything representative pomona said that when we agreed to allow the denver broncos out of their lease we were playing between five and six million dollars a year madam chair for the operation maintenance costs of mile high stadium pat boland wanted a new facility we said the only way we could do that is if it was a six-county venture and it would have to be created by the legislature and we supported the broncos effort to come to the legislature and create the metropolitan state metropolitan and football district authority what representative pabon is doing is guaranteeing the word mile high will be in it as was asked by the questions here it is a little bit of this a little bit of that because you could do it contractually but then you could also keep it out contractually as well what this does it guarantees the wording mile high will be in the will be in the name whatever that might be so if corporations come and go the one thing that taxpayers and bronco fans and lovers of the world mile high will be guaranteed is that the word mile high will be in the stadium name thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions of this witness okay this should be a good government uh bill that the colorado general assembly could ought to have a hundred co-sponsors on this uh thank you for your testimony uh mayor where we want to make sure that you do sign in for the record before you leave is there anyone else who'd like to testify on house bill 16 14 55 if there are none the witness testimony is now closed representative pabon do you have any amendments one amendment madam chair uh madam chair and i think it's been distributed saltman did you distribute the amendment already yeah it was under the it was under the stack of uh i don't want to be like that sorry would you like to move your amendment i move l01 to the amendment representative can i get a second i'll second thank you um madam chair this the uh bill contemplates the bill the house bill number on page two line 18 and because uh uh we don't know the bill number until the bill's been right across we have to amend it to uh memorialize house bill 1455. thank you committee are there any objections to l zero zero one there being none l zero zero one passes representative pablon are they further amendments no madam chair committee do you have any amendments there being none the amendment phase is now closed representative pabone any closing comments thank you madam chair um you know just i'll just be brief um i did find something uh on the sports authority field stadium that captured um the essence of what this does better than i can so i'm just going to read that and i want to thank representative garnett for bringing that to my attention the the question is how do you measure the soul of a city in denver for the better part of four decades it's been by the broncos and by mile high stadium from the first nationally televised monday night game in 1973 through 26 post-season games that include back-to-back world championships and four other super bowl appearances the broncos arguably have provided the mile high city's primary identity on a national level all this was done while playing in the venerable mile high stadium mile high stadium was the birthplace of bronco mania the stadium nurtured both the fans and the team and watched bronco mania become a national phenomenon the nation's first truly regional sports franchise the broncos were the first major league team to call denver home beginning play as a charter member of the new american football league with its first season being 1960. the denver broncos have played in mile high stadium since their inception the stadium was originally built in 1948 with a capacity of 18 000 for the city's minor league baseball team the denver bears capacity was doubled in 1960 for the broncos first season the capacity of mile high stadium now stands at 76 082 making it one of the largest facilities in the national football league given the dynamics of modern stadium design and financial imperatives of professional sports in the 1990s the need for a new football stadium was obvious and the broncos moved to their new stadium for the 2001 season the new stadium now 15 years old assures a prominent place for denver as professional football prepares to move into the 21st century the new stadium again 15 years old now will be a fabulous venue for the broncos but in our hearts mile high stadium will be with us always sign jim saccamano denver broncos vice president of media relations mile high stadium will be with us always through house bill 1455. forever mile high that's all the taxpayers asked for thank you representative pabum committee before we get a motion and vote on house bill 16 14 55 we're going to recess so we can make sure representative craft tharp who's working on a bill can get over and vote yes representative garnett thank you madam chair since we're not tight on time uh since we're waiting for uh representative craft tharp uh representative pabone actually left out the best part of uh of that letter that we found online so i'm just gonna read it into the record to make sure that we have it for all the people that are listening in 1967 the demo broncos face a crisis when voters declined a bond issue to construct a new stadium but local fans came to the rescue forming a non-profit group called the doers and raising 1.8 million to purchase bear stadium which was the minor league baseball team from its private owners and they presented the deed to the city the following year the addition of the upper deck increased capacity to 50 000 and the facility was renamed denver mile high stadium so it really was the people of this community who saved the original stadium by coming and raising philanthropic dollars to purchase it and then the next year they renamed it mile high so thanks representative pavone for bringing this forward i think it's uh forever will be mile high in our hearts and now with this bill will be forever mile high on the stadium and i still urge that the colors be blue and orange because uh i don't think uh denver broncos fans dislike any team worse than the kansas city chiefs and that's what the sports authority logo reminds me of thank you representative garnett representative rosenthal thank you madam chair um one of the things that has always annoyed me even though yes they have changed the name to sports authority field at mile high or whatever name that they're going to have in the future for whatever new sponsor they're gonna have is i don't really care to say that i like just saying mile high stadium and hopefully i have your permission here on out to just say that although you probably would say no we can because we need to make sure we have a sponsor but i just prefer to say mile high stadium that's just my sense of it great committee we will not have to recess madame vice chair is present and we have more closing comments representative west we are a little after four man i'm sure so i am i'm tempting fate here so i i'm i'm struggling with a couple of concepts here and that is that this stadium should be called mile high stadium it was mile high stadium to me it will always be mile high stadium it's what i call it but i also recognize that we set up an entity here to govern uh this issue and to make this decision so what i'm struggling with is is this an appropriate issue for the legislature to handle or is this the board's decision uh to make uh this board represents the people um these these directors i think are well aware of what the sentiment is here so i'm struggling with those two concepts i certainly would like to know the board's position on this to see whether legislation on this is even necessary so with that madam chair i thank you representative bone for bringing the bill committee are there any further closing comments representative winter i just want to thank representative bone for bringing this bill as a proud broncos fan i'm very excited to vote on it and just to show the strength of mile high and the strength of bronco spirit in our state the broncos have sold out and had a full house since 1970 with only two exceptions which was during the players strike and so in honor of those fans i'm excited to vote yes representative pabon thank you for bringing this bill before us i think this committee supports your efforts and the denver broncos were always big fans and would you like uh provide a motion for your bill thank you madam chair madam chair i proudly move house bill 1455 as amended to the committee of the whole with a favorable recommendation i'll second that house bill 16 1455 has been motioned by representative pabone to the committee as a whole with a favorable recommendation as amended and second by representative williams miss altman will you please take the roll call representatives aren't yes garnett yes navarro yes nordberg respectfully no bone yes rosenthal omaha in other words yes yes yes yes science yes yes winter yes west respectfully no craft art yes madam chair yes congratulations representative pabon your bill passes 11 to 2. you're on your way to the floor thank you members of the esteemed business committee thank you members we're going to recess just for a few minutes come back at 4 25 okay and then we'll hear our last bill because we need to be back on the floor by 5 30. you you the business affairs and labor committee will come back to order we have house bill 16 1370 and with representative singer please tell us about your bill representative singer and representative coram uh thank you madam chair uh 1370 is uh something that we've been working on for quite a while worked through a lot of stakeholders and do the fact that we're very rushed on time i'm going to give a very abbreviated opening and so we'll get to the testimony but community-based application awards um summary 31 public organizations have been awarded up to a three-year projected amount of over 18 million dollars uh and members if you have this you can follow along and we have the uh the meat of of each little statement in the packet if you care to look at it um previous grant awards from 2011-12 of the communities listed fountain manitou golden pueblo steamboat and breckenridge have all passed local otp licenses there is a direct correlation between these grant dollars and the new local licensure as a condition of receiving these amendment 35 dollars applicants for the 216-18 need to be included to include required and optional strategies one of the required strategies uh page five of the handout um that uh passed to strengthen non-cigarette ordinances and basically what we're trying to do is just basically level this out um we're saying that amendment 35 dollars shouldn't be used for political ads and and should be used for enforcement in and we have an amendment uh l zero zero five it in your possession and uh i think that will clarify a lot of the bill that's basically the the meat of the bill now representative singer thank you madam chair i'll be brief as representative coram was as well the fundamental question here is whether or not taxpayer approved dollars should go to political advocacy or whether we should be spending those monies on direct interventions to make sure that youth don't get access to tobacco what this bill with this amendment really focuses on is simply that issue of was it the voter's intent to make sure that these taxpayer approved dollars in amendment 35 were to be required to be used for political advocacy or actual prevention and intervention efforts outside the political arena i'll leave it at that and either open it up to questions i know we have quite a few witnesses signed up in testimony and and i want to be fair to the entire committee so we can make sure that we are able to get back onto the floor at an appropriate time and thank you for your attention thank you representative art thank you madam chair so the bill's been amended down to this issue why did it start with the registry and everything else and how did we get from there to here before the committee hearing representative singer thank you madam chair well we wanted to add a few wrinkles to your brain and to your brow i think what we tried to do is we really wanted to create something that split the difference and i give the tobacco prevention individuals here a lot of credit now the industry is coming to the table saying look we should be on the radar we should be catching the bad actors and what we attempted to do is basically split the difference and say you know what maybe a licensure isn't the way to go but at least we should do a registry to get these folks on the radar but the trade-off there was to eliminate the local issue as you can tell that is an incredibly complex issue very and a very um passionate issue and so instead of dealing with with the bigger issue at hand as to how we get all of these different um tobacco retailers on the radar what we've done is really eliminate that component saying we should increase inspections that's the first part of the bill on lines one through eight and then the second part of the bill says we don't need to be directing money to political advocacy we can we can do something better with these dollars we can follow the voters intent and and make sure that we're doing the right thing so it's it's a very powered down version i'm not sure if you want to talk about previous iterations of the bill um i understand that we have to adopt this amendment but that that's how we got from where we were to where we are today representative rosenthal thank you madam shared thank you representatives what does it mean political advocacy representative singer so if you turn to um in your packet you'll see something with a little sticky note on it or a little tab and if you open to page 5 of 12 one of the things that's required is that grantees that are receiving these amendment 35 dollars are required to work to pass or strengthen non-cigarette tobacco retail license ordinances so basically what this is saying is um we're using taxpayer-funded dollars to actually pass city ordinances city laws if you look at the language of the bill we specify that um these should not these dollars should not be going to policy initiatives or advocacy efforts that encourage or promote elected officials so to uh introduce laws ordinances resolutions or charter provisions uh that create or strengthen tobacco related business taxation licensing or fees so once again the heart of the issue being should state taxpayer dollars that people voted for be specifically routed to this one um political advocacy avenue committee are there any further questions of our sponsors there being none well we will now enter into the witness testimony phase on house bill 16 1370 and sponsors you have 13 opposed three support and one for questions only how would you like to proceed i think we'll go with the opposition first in the order that they signed up and and just for the committee is where i may be called to testify on another bill i'm not walking out on you guys forever i'll be back thank you we'll first start with gabrielle kaplan and i want to share with everyone in the room due to the number of people we have to testify we want to make sure everyone has an opportunity that your testimony will be timed at two minutes each so if you happen to hear something that you had in your mind you want to testify you may want to regroup your thoughts to maximize your two minutes and you'll see that there's a little timer there on the table at green it means it's go when it gets to yellow you're at 30 seconds and red we will cut off your testimony so we'll ask gabrielle kaplan to please come forward thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent good afternoon madam chairwoman my name is gabriel dr gabriel kaplan i'm the branch chief for health promotion and chronic disease prevention in the prevention services division of the department of public health and environment and i'm here on behalf of dr larry wolck the department's executive director and colorado's chief medical officer to express the agency's significant concerns with the provisions of house bill 16 1370. we've been concerned about this legislation throughout its life but we'll share that it's been difficult to track what is in or out of this bill at any one time and we are still not clear what policy problem this is intended to solve tobacco remains a leading killer of coloradans it is one of the few products sold in colorado today which one used as directed will kill you approximately 5 000 and 100 coloradans every year succumb to tobacco and thousands more suffer from illnesses and poor health brought on by their use of tobacco this cost the state over 2 billion in direct healthcare costs and lost productivity and taxpayers bear much of the brunt of this to the tune of roughly 576 dollars per colorado household per year we know that 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking before they were 18 years old and the tobacco industry knows this as well they know the best way to build a pipeline of future consumers is to hook them early and thanks to years of study by scholars and data and evidence uh reviewed by others such as the centers for disease control we know the evidence-based strategies that work to try to prevent this we have two main strategies the first is to encourage and offer opportunities for smokers to quit and the second is to prevent our youth from ever initiating smoking we do this through a grant program and each grant application asks applicants to identify the areas in which they would like to do their work and to select those and the ones that are in that menu available to them are all evidence-based as instructed by statute and the cdc has found that initiatives of this kind that are referred to in this legislation are evidence-based and they're the best way to reduce such initiation and when they've been done in colorado they've led to reductions in youth access to tobacco from 40 percent mr kaplan thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for our sponsor representative art thank you madam chair it's my question day um thank you for coming have you had a chance to see the amendment l005 i have madam chairman yes representative madam chair thank you um would you like to speak to that amendment please mr kaplan sure uh thank you madam chair um so the language of this amendment is concerning on several several levels uh the constitution was amendment amended in 2004 by the voters and at the very beginning of that amendment it states that colorado should deter children and youth from starting smoking and the tobacco tax revenues will be used to expand health care for children and low-income populations for tobacco education programs and for the prevention and treatment of cancer heart disease and lung disease and 16 percent of those revenues are appropriated for school community-based and state-wide tobacco education programs designed to reduce initiation of tobacco use by children and youth promote cessation of youth of tobacco use and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke so it's very clear that the grantees with these funds are expected to educate the members of their community at all levels regardless of their position whether they be private citizens or officials working within the government of the county or members of county commissioners or city elected officials that education is what the voters of colorado wanted we are concerned that this language that prohibits any activity any initiative that would encourage or promote a member of a city council or of a county commissioner to take an action such as to propose legislation would be barred from those grantees uh we have some concerns that that's a violation of what the intent in the constitution and when the voters voted for it is we've asked the governor's legal counsel and they said that there are a lot of questions raised about the constitutionality of this kind of language because it is overly broad we have had conversations with some individuals uh actually of the legislative body about this work uh and the previous explanation of the concerns that were shared with us was around the term lobbying and lobbying is much more narrowly defined than the notion of encouraging or promoting policy initiatives that limit access to tobacco finally i would like to share with you um a couple of pieces of material and information that we share regularly in public health one is and i can make this available if you like it's the 10 essential services of public health and you'll see that one of the key services of public health this is an approved document from the field of public health that is used by all public health officials employees members of our community across the country it's advocated and supported and endorsed by the american public health association and you can see number five right here is develop policies and then number six is mobilize community partnerships unfortunately the development of policies and the mobilization of community partnerships could be potentially prescribed by this amendment language furthermore if you look at a document that i also have here which is an mmwr this is the morbidity and mortality weekly review from the cdc it talks about the 10 great public health achievements of the united states in the last 100 years of the 20th century and you'll see that there are important initiatives that uh we can thank every day for saving the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens and our family members motor vehicle safety as an example of this safe and healthier foods is an example of this the control of infectious disease is another example of this family planning is another example of this fluoridation of community drinking water and finally recognition of tobacco use as a health hazard in every one of those instances the public health community was actively involved in educating policymakers around this country about the evidence for different kinds of policy initiatives and what impacts that those would have and members of a community that want to ask those questions and ask what are the best things that we can do to prevent our youth from getting tobacco and getting hold of tobacco those things would be potentially prescribed by this amendment so we have very deep concerns thank you representative rosenthal thank you madam chair thank you sir so could you tell me a little bit more about this uh 500 uh 500 what is it 520 000 oh 550 000 or what's what's the amount that's currently allocated uh from which um i guess the bill uh l005 says 520 thousand dollars and and then there's part of that money is gonna go towards these new inspectors so what is that money being used for now uh that uh yeah mr capps thank you madam chair so uh you may want to ask the sponsors that same question uh under the original legislation um which the legislature enacted as sort of authorizing after the amendment was approved by the voters 350 000 was set aside for the department of revenue to do inspections and to make the to really cover the costs that they were going to have as a result of the amendment 35 legislation this amendment increases that amount by 170 000 to a total of hundred and twenty thousand dollars so it would increase the revenues available to the department of uh revenue for these inspections and for other associated responsibilities by one hundred and seventy thousand dollars and uh it directs that specifically for the concept of enforcement which is a department of revenue program representative rosenthal thank you madam chair so basically there's really no net loss to that fund because it's going from 350 to 520 and then part of that money is going towards these inspectors and yet well what about the original fund where this 350 is coming from where's that coming from mr kaplan thank you madam chair so uh there's a there's the original revenues that get raised uh as a result of the amendment and uh i think currently we're getting as a state about 140 million dollars and then there's a formula within um the actual amendment in the constitution which says that 48 will be allocated for this purpose and 16 will be allocated for this purpose uh and so within that uh those provisions there was money set aside 350 000 of that overall budget of 140 million dollars for the department of revenue to cover their costs of implementing it and so this uh legislation this initiative would take monies from that fund raised by the tax the tax on tobacco products and on cigarettes and increased the allotment to the department of revenue by 170 000. this would decrease the amount of revenues that would be available to all the other recipients of that money who range from the child health insurance program to medicaid to the early detection prevention and treatment fund for cancer and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and also for our tobacco control education efforts thank you committee representative thurlow thank you madam chair thank you doctor i'm still trying to get my mind around that concept of how much money there is is the money that's being taken in the bill a big amount or is it a small amount you're talking about the whole pie is 140 million dollars and then how does it break down from there can you or is there someone else here that can tell us who gets what i think there's some that's allocated to local communities and how much what's the relativity of this amount in the bill mr kaplan thank you madam chair so i uh took the liberty of refreshing my memory uh of section 21 of the colorado constitution and i uh printed that out before i came i have 10 pages of well 10 copies of that of that section of the constitution i can share that with the members of the committee and the breakdowns of the revenue are are listed in that amendment to the constitution so i can read from it um 46 of such revenues are appropriated that's from the 140 million 46 of this goes for the children's basic health plan to cover enrollment through that 19 percent is available to fund comprehensive primary care through any qualified colorado provider through the colorado medical assistance act then there are further definitions around that 16 of such revenues are appropriated for school and community uh state and statewide tobacco education programs those are funds that come to the department of public health so we get 16 of the 140 million dollars for our state tobacco grants program and that right now i think is about 21 million dollars we also get 16 for this prevention early detection treatment and cardiovascular pulmonary disease fund and that goes to a number of different programs it goes to breast and cervical cancer screening it goes to what we call our cancer cardiovascular pulmonary disease grants program it goes to the office of health equity grants program and it goes to a few other smaller items as well within the department and then three percent of such revenues are appropriated for health related purposes uh that provide revenue to the state's general fund the old age pension fund and municipal and county governments to compensate them for the reductions in cigarette sales that they experienced as a result of tobacco of amendment 35. representative syas all right thank you thank you sir and this may be something the sponsors want to address as well i'm looking at the amendment and i always get a little bit uh jittery when we start talking about things that seem to uh that seem to impinge on speech or forms of speech and i'm just wondering if i heard your testimony correctly it sounds as though what you're saying is that if a an employee of an entity uh who received this this funding were to themselves want to have a conversation to try and persuade an elected official to follow a certain course of action that they would be prohibited from having that conversation am i understanding your testimony correctly mr kaplan thank you madam chair uh that is that is my interpretation of the language if you look at the language it says um i think the exact language they use is any uh initiative that would encourage or promote um the elected official at a city or county or municipal level to make it a proposal to amend their charter their statutes etc and so i think the question is what initiatives uh do you prohibit that and then how do you sort of demonstrate a causal effect between the statements of an individual and the decisions of an elected official at the county level so if for instance we had the state public health department sorry the county public health department in for instance jefferson county was talking about the percentage of youth in jefferson county who are able to obtain cigarettes illegally and was talking about the different kinds of policies that are available to the county to get cigarettes to a point where they're harder to get a hold of and if that discussion was held in any forum and a city official learned about that discussion and thought hmm maybe i should write something for our city municipal ordinance that would be considered as the language is defined a prohibited activity it doesn't sort of limit it to lobbying it it really doesn't even limit it to political advocacy it doesn't talk about political advocacy it talks about initiatives that encourage or promote policy change representative science thank you madam chair and yes sir i think as i'm reading it now it's it's to fund policy initiatives or advocacy efforts and i i would like to give the the sponsors a chance if the if they want to address that as well but that that that is sort of how i'm reading it looking at that now and that does i have to say make me a little nervous thank you committee are there any further questions of mr kaplan representative coram uh yes i i have a question um and if members if you'll look at your handout number six in 2012 the state auditor um report questioning the use of amendment 35 to fund local initiatives and the disagreement from the department and was asked for the to seek a formal uh attorney general's opinion to date that has never happened is can you tell me why that never happened mr kaplan thank you madam chair it actually has happened so uh i can sort of recount for the members of the committee uh the staff of the state auditor's office was concerned about some of the policy work that was being done we explained to them that we felt that this was allowed under the statute they then said well let's take an opinion from the office of legislative legal counsel the office of legislative legal counsel said that the policy work that was being done by the grantees was in their view all acceptable except for some of the work around some of the secondhand smoke initiatives but they specifically said that the retail types of initiatives that grantees were working on were acceptable under the statute we went from there to the attorney general's office and we asked for them for an opinion and they said that any activity that green teas engage in which educates members of their community regardless of their position in that community uh that is related to policy was allowable and we can share that document with you uh if you like it was a table produced by the chief attorney general official assigned to the department i'd like to have that thank you committee are there any further questions of mr kaplan there being none thank you for being with us today and answering all the questions thank you madam chair i do have a letter from the chairman uh the chairs of the tobacco review committee they were not able to be here they're both doctors and they had patients to see today and i would like to submit that in the record for um for ural's review if you are interested thank you we'll make sure committee members receive that next we'll have jeff king thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent for the record i'm chair my name is dr jeff kane i'm a family doctor in denver i'm representing the colorado academy of family physicians and also children's hospital colorado please proceed with your testimony thank you very much i'm actually coming to talk with you a little bit as someone that's actually worked with amendment 35 dollars i've helped train family doctors to talk to kids about tobacco i've actually talked to people in city council meetings i've talked to people the state legislature we just heard a moment ago that tobacco causes 5 000 deaths a year that's a big number but for me it's a gentleman named carl that i helped take care of towards the end of his life and what i know is that the kids start using tobacco at an early age and there are 3 400 children every year in colorado that become addicted to tobacco i think we should do whatever we can to help kids choose not to be addicts to tobacco to help keep them safe from those tobacco-caused illnesses tobacco causes more illness than aids cocaine suicide homicide alcohol fire firearms automobile accidents all those things combined we have a lot of rules and policies to help us with that the centers for disease control says three things help keep kids away from it make it more expensive do advertising to help them not do that and thirdly to have local ordinances to make it harder for kids to be able to buy tobacco that's what we're talking about having prohibiting people like me from talking to local city councils about how to help make it harder for kids to buy tobacco so i took time off of my office today because i think that's really important for kids health for my patients health because i don't want to have to take care of more carls so that's my my comments in brief i'm sure thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions of this witness representative west thank you madam chair um doctor i i think we sort of share the goal um could you to could you talk about the importance of parents in terms of communicating oh with the children about uh about the dangers of tobacco mr kane i'm sorry um it's really important for tobacco to be talked about with kids one of the best ways to help a kid not use tobacco is to help a parent quit using tobacco if they're already using tobacco so some of the programs that you'll hear about prevention talk to parents about helping kids talk to their kids in ways that are effective so we should use lots of messages in different times we should talk in schools we should talk and meet you we should talk as parents thank you committee are there any further questions of this witness there being none thank you for being with us today thank you i'm going to really mess this up but when you get here corrected um sirose chair graves yes please come forward yes please you may sit there is there someone else like to join you that's fine thank you mark from boulder county okay please state your name and who you represent this is better my name is serge that's loud my name is sasha karis graves i am from golden i'm on golden city council and i'm here to represent the council thank you please proceed with your testimony thank you um golden is proud of the work we've done in the community to address tobacco use our community takes pride in being a destination for families wellness and health the 20 20 30 vision that we created together outlines our community values including a healthy sustainable community today and for those who follow our work to address tobacco use is consistent with these community values as we've identified in our golden vision 2030 plan we believe local communities and our local grantees should be allowed to address tobacco use at the local level without penalty our non-cigarette tobacco licensing has been highly successful it's a non-cigarette license to avoid the state's penalty for licensing cigarettes it's already incredible that the state penalizes a community for wanting to address the most deadly product we sell in the state and the bill before you wants to go even further and punish communities for addressing other tobacco products our reta our retailers have complied with our license system our recent compliance check found no violations and that perhaps that's because our penalties for selling to minors can include suspension and revocation of someone's ability to sell tobacco we've not had to utilize those penalties but as a community we decided that we wanted to have that option it's what we felt was appropriate for our community and for protecting our kids we should not be penalized for that our local amendment 35 grantees have provided valuable education and support for city council local control is an important part of colorado's history i also have a resolution to submit from our city council in opposition to house bill 1370 passed unanimously on april 14th i urge you to oppose house bill 1370 and the amendments that work to punish or restrict local activity to reduce death and disease from tobacco use thank you thank you for your testimony mr rusin yeah mark russin i am a senior policy analyst in the boulder county commissioner's office i appreciate the opportunity madam chair and committee members as well as to representative quorum and representative singer to testify here in opposition hb 1370 on behalf of the boulder county board of county commissioners and the boulder county board of health why do we care about hb 1370 according to the 2013 healthy kids colorado survey of boulder county high school students about 8 percent of boulder county high school students smoke cigarettes and about 66 percent tell us it would be sort of or very easy for them to get cigarettes and in fact in our two largest cities boulder and longmont tobacco retailers fail fda tobacco compliance checks involving youth sales about 12 percent of the time or one of every eight sales one one of every eight times they're checked we know that one of the primary ways we can help youth and young people avoid heart disease lung disease and cancer is to ensure that they either never start using tobacco or quit before tobacco addiction becomes too difficult to overcome boulder county is evidence that these practices work the very types of practices that amendment 5 is proposing to to limit according to that same healthy colorado healthy kids colorado survey that i mentioned previously in 2013 eight percent of boulder county high school students were smokers in 2003 that number was 22 10 years we've seen significant decline others here uh have already explained much better than i ever could why hb 1370 is flawed and you'll hear some more evidence in that regard i will suggest to you to you that is because of successes like we've seen here in boulder county that we here know clamoring from our constituents five thousands of seventy five thousand of which i will point out that our county commissioners share with representative singer uh for some kind of rollback or any kind of rollback and youth cessation efforts uh as those are being contemplated by hb 1370. thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for these witnesses representative rosenthal uh thank you madam chair i'm sorry uh the representative from golden i forgot your name um thank you for your testimony so um you said that you have very uh strong penalties for selling to minors and yet you know we've been told regularly before this uh hearing that there simply is not enough inspections and that um by the time an inspector gets around to inspecting another location it's past the two-year period therefore it's just a written warning and they never get a monetary warning they never get shut down they never get their license revoked um so i'm trying to sort of you know bring those two concepts together what's really happening out there ms graves thank you there is follow-up um we have had a compliance check there were no violations our um our retailers know that they're subject to these checks we haven't had to impose those penalties we hope we never have to but the education process appears to have been of benefit it appears to have helped them understand what they need to do and as f you know when i go in when others go in um there's no evidence that they're that they're not complying with um the licensing requirements thank you mr rudson yeah madam chair if i may also try to help i believe it's because the city of gold primarily because the city of golden actually has a licensure program the rest of us do not and that's why compliance is a much more difficult uh challenge in our communities committee are there any further questions of these witnesses there being none thank you both for being here today thank you jeff wilson please state your name and who you represent then you can proceed with your testimony thank you madam chairman members of the committee i'm jeff wilson i'm general counsel for the colorado municipal league first time before this committee this year better late than never um we uh have very strong opposition to the bill in its printed form in 1973 the some 70 municipalities made a deal with the general assembly in the tobacco industry to repeal our local tax ordinances regarding cigarettes in substitution for a state collected locally shared cigarette tax that's that deal has stood for 43 years and is embodied in the statutes the printed form of the bill proposed a violation of that agreement of breach and we of course uh would you know would recommend that we keep our word and keep our deals happily uh amendment l.005 removes all of the consideration and intrusion into the 1973 deal from the bill so our issues are resolved if l.005 is adopted i had detailed testimony about the 73 deal but with that amendment on the table i'll just cut it off at that thank you thank you for your testimony committee do you have any questions for this there being none thank you for being with us today chris bowie please state your names and who you represent no no there we go hi my name is dan sapienza and i'm here representing the health district in northern larimer county uh in opposition to this legislation uh in our county uh in 2015 during compliance checks one in eight miners that tried to purchase cigarettes was successful the state program right now just isn't working but local municipalities have shown as golden said earlier they've shown some really great opportunities uh to have licensure that does work and so we should be encouraging local municipalities to do whatever they can to prevent youth smoking and adopt local ordinances that work within their communities this bill undermines those local efforts and we oppose it i hope you vote no thank you thank you who'd like to testify next thank you please state your name and who you represent my name is chris bowie and i'm here on behalf of the colorado public health association i'm on the board of directors as the professional education and develop senior chair and our association represents public health professionals and students throughout colorado the colorado public health association strongly opposes house bill 1370 with proposed amendments spills detrimental to public health efforts to appropriately address the harms of underage sale possession and use of tobacco products local activities addressing public health related issues not just tobacco in colorado has been paramount to earning colorado's reputation as one of the healthiest states in the nation as such on behalf of colorado public health association please vote no on house bill 1370. thank you for your testimony please state your name and who you represent thank you madam chair my name is lisa van ramdunk i'm the executive director of the colorado association of local public health officials with the association for all the local health departments i'm here to share just a little slightly different information for you we do oppose this bill and the amendments 39 of our 54 public health agencies have board of health members who are only county commissioners at least five of our boards of health out of the 54 have city council persons who also sit on the board of health so what i'm telling you is that elected officials are the bosses of our local public health agencies so this bill restricts communication between local public health professionals and their bosses i think you know it's important to understand that your local public health staff are at the front lines of finding and tracking community problems community problems like lead in the water community problems like contagious disease and community problems like tobacco use in youth and the idea of this very very broad language sets a disastrous precedent where we control how our local public health agencies and how our local public health professionals are allowed to talk with their elected officials and their community leaders about the community problems in their community that's all i have for you thank you thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for these witnesses representative thurlow thank you madam chair uh thank all of you for being here i think my question is for mr sapienza if i've got that right and and possibly and i'm sorry i didn't ask it of mr wilson earlier but is is that part of the 1973 deal did that deal was part of the deal that communities wouldn't start their own licensing procedures and is that the heart of the problem is now communities are starting their own licensing procedures which it makes it harder for all of the stores that some of them are statewide they have to now adhere to multiple different standards in multiple different communities is that the crux of what we're talking about just happy ending excuse me thank you um i can't speak to the deal that was made in 1973 so perhaps the previous witness would have been a better choice there but in larimer county without any licensure required you know following these state rules um compliance is very low like i said in 2015 we had one in eight miners during compliance checks um so we need some solution and so our local municipalities are starting to look at this i believe and we're hoping they might put in some licensure requirements to reduce that number representative rosenthal thank you madam chair and anybody can i guess address this i guess as i i look at this amendment number five um which is causing me struggle because part of it i i think is probably a good idea the part about hiring more inspectors and yet the other part of it on line eight onwards um about barring this um ability for uh to for funding policy initiatives or advocacy efforts that causes me trouble so um if if let's just say and if we were to strike that part that said you know getting rid of the whole part about barring policy initiatives and stuff and just hiring a couple more inspectors since that seems to be the need out there as they need more more inspectors cut down on the number of places that are selling to miners would that be agreeable to you whoever would like to answer okay thank you thank you madam chair thank you representative um i'd have to look again i think there's two concerning parts especially concerning i should say um the first is the restricting communication and the second although i didn't mention it in my testimony is the idea of legislating evidence-based i think the whole purpose of evidence-based is that we're continuing to build what that means and so putting what is and is not evidence-based and what in statute seems to be against that we're always learning representative thank you so i uh my understanding is is that that this is not suggesting um and i could be wrong that you don't use evidence based programs it's not suggesting that you don't communicate but that it is suggesting that we don't use these dollars for policy initiatives or advocacy efforts my understanding is is that amendment 35 dollars were passed by the citizens for designated for health care services and tobacco education to improve the health of all coloradans i'm quoting that from the cdphe website so how does using these dollars i'm not saying other dollars you have but using these dollars amendment 35 dollars for policy initiatives and advocacy efforts meet the um uh the revenue designation that was that the citizens voted for mr bowie thank you madam chair so a lot of this these monies go toward policy work in general it can look many different ways it goes organizational it can go through kind of other policies for i'll use local colleges or community college campuses it can be campus work there's there's different ways that we are able to provide materials and education efforts and provide the right kind of engagement with our with our with our people i wouldn't say that it's just aimed and tailored we don't specifically go out and say that we're targeting elected officials we're going out and we're doing what public health goals are are supposed to do and it's to educate the public and it happens that we have people that are elected officials or part of governing bodies or are at home and it just ranges from everybody so we we are aiming to educate thank you committee are there any further questions from this set of witnesses there being none thank you for being with us today rick ritter thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent absolutely thank you so much committee for taking time out of your busy schedules to hear my testimony my name is rick ritter i'm representing alexander matthew curie and nathaniel my four kiddos and i'm also here as a public health employee representing public health my family's previous experience with tobacco underscores the reason i'm so passionate about tobacco control and really making sure children do not start using it my father died a very lingering death from metastatic lung cancer my mom died a very quick death from congestive heart failure and they initiated tobacco use my mom was 13. my dad was 15. there simply weren't good protective measures in place back then and representative you said it's important for parents to talk to their kids absolutely but i believe it takes a village to raise a child and i think we need to come together united as both parents individuals and government to protect our most valuable resource our children as a public health professional there's a number of troubling uh issues in this bill i'd like to just share one with you it significantly weakens the consequences for illegally selling to minors my agency worked hand in hand with the city of rocky ford a couple years ago to pass a non-cigarette tobacco license that is working captain angelo griego will talk to that he's the one in the trenches doing it he's going to come after me it has revocation and suspension provisions it means business if you sell to kids and get them to start smoking we're going to have some teeth we can pull your license i think there's six dor representatives in the state that does compliance now and that is far far too few those joining me in opposition to hp 1370 include the crowley board of county commissioners the otero board of county commissioners our local board of health and the city of rocky ford as i mentioned that success the community came together and passed a non-cigarette tobacco license that was a community's decision i'm all about local control we need to be as strict as a state but can we be stricter yes and if a community wants to go that extra step to protect the youth they should be allowed to do it two seconds thank you for your testimony mr ritter thank you committee are there any questions for this witness i just want to say welcome to the state capitol and thank you for being so passionate and representing otero county i appreciate you very much thank you representative thank you for your testimony thank you and you have to be back on the floor at 5 30. 6 30 you've got a tough job thank you for representing us well and that is 5 30 committee angela angelo griego hello thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent sure thing my name is angelo grigo i'm captain for the rocky ford police department i'm here to talk to you in opposition of this bill again thank you for your time on 9 9 2014 the city of rocky ford was progressive in protecting their youth by passing ordinances 901 and 902 now these ordinances in conjunction with current cigarette laws made it tougher for tobacco companies to push their products through advertising advertising and self-service display to any youth entering a store where non-secret tobacco products are sold just as important as the ordinances themselves is the enforcement of these ordinances as outlined in the ordinances the rocky ford police department conducts two compliance checks within a one-year period by allowing municipal municipalities the opportunity to create policy and the ordinances which directly impact their citizens and in this case their youth allows city government the opportunity to regulate the vendors who choose to violate tobacco laws now if this bill passes the youth in our cities are at the mercy of the department of revenue no res no disrespect but because they are understaffed and do not have the time to conduct these laws on a regular basis whereas the city of rocky ford is currently able to do this successfully lastly well i have some other things but because of a two-minute time constraint lastly if this bill does pass the city of rocky ford knows that they could gain annual rev potential increase in funds however we've contemplated is that mountain is that amount of money worth the risk of one youth in our communities to be subjected to the most destructive and addictive substance sold in our stores because the rocky ford police department and the city government has worked diligently to protect our youth from nicotine and tobacco products we say it's not worth it so i ask you please take into consideration help our citizens and our youth and vote no on this bill thank you for your testimony if if i may um mr rosenthal had a couple questions um that i might be able to answer for him in regards to inspections please proceed thank you um mr rosenthal i'm sorry representative rosenthal okay okay you had you were asking about compliance checks and frequency i can tell you in the city of rocky ford in our area the last time uh the department of revenue was down was only because of a complaint um so they decided to come down prior to that the last time they had come down was in 2011. the last time was in 2014 and again in 2015 prior to that they hadn't been down so here we're talking about compliance checks where us the city of rocky ford the people on my team are able to do biannual and that's just a bare minimum buy annual compliance checks whereas the department of revenue does this over a certain period of time with six people on their team for the whole state of colorado i don't know i hope maybe that answered your question a little bit more did i answer all your questions representative rosenthal thank you all right committee are there any further questions of this witness there being none thank you for being with us today jody redke thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent my name is jody bradke and i am the regional director with the campaign for tobacco free kids and good afternoon madam chair members of the committee i'm rj hours with the american cancer society cancer action network and i'm a member also of the colorado tobacco control alliance and here on behalf of both those groups on behalf of acs can and the alliance are i want to express our opposition to house bill 1370 and all proposed amendments uh we are very supportive of legislation seeking to improve or to remove impediments to effective local public health efforts particularly when it comes to the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products unfortunately house bill 1370 falls woefully short of that objective and in point of fact would harm progress already achieved in a half a dozen colorado communities who now have comprehensive licensing for the sale of tobacco products other than cigarettes in fact house bill 1370 represents about the fourth time in the past 43 years that big tobacco and its surrogate organizations have sought to blunt or undermine local control of a public health matter such as youth tobacco prevention indeed these grassroots efforts in local communities and the awareness of tobacco control issues build community support and foster informed discourse about the need for a change in public health norms i'm going to turn over discussion now to my colleague jody who will go into more detail about some of the work that the tobacco industry and its surrogates do madam chair may i distribute a document prior to my testimony with the clerk for distribution yes thank you thank you and while she's coming to um get that i would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to relay our opposition to this bill to house bill 1370. if this bill is truly concerning the regulation of nicotine product retailers end quote as the title suggests then the bill would do just that it would regulate retail sales questioning the effectiveness of colorado's state tobacco prevention and cessation program and redirecting funding is a distraction from the bill that was originally drafted we see these distractions nationwide when legislation is being considered at the state level that appears to effectively reduce tobacco use the document that's being distributed for your review and consideration i won't walk you through it in its entirety but these are tactics that are outlined in the tobacco industries quote policy plan these are documents available as part of the master settlement agreement and requirement for full disclosure of their policy plans and documents and work within our state legislatures these policy this policy plan includes four tactics i think a couple of those are relevant for today's discussion one of which is to diminish anti-tobacco funding you'll see it on page five the third strategy of those four tactics under diminished funding the three that i think are applicable today and the way they employ that strategy is to to do the following three things one is to challenge anti-tobacco programs through oversight agencies and an auditing procedure secondly to create the illusion that public funds under our state programs are being used for lobbying when indeed they are not and the third is to work with friendly legislators to hold hearings on the efficacy of these programs and quote arm them with evidence of waste abuse and efficacy of our programs these tactics and strategies are employed to divert the attention from our state legislatures from what we and they know is effective which is a comprehensive licensing program that creates actual accountability we urge you to vote no as amended and as originally drafted this bill undermines our cities our counties our towns and the state tobacco program that was approved by colorado's voter voters and further harms colorado's kids we appreciate you for your testimony you're welcome camille are there any questions of these witnesses there being we appreciate you being here today thank you madam chair jill bednarek please state your name and who you represent good afternoon madam chair my name is jill bednerick i represent the colorado department of public health and environment i work in the tobacco program please proceed with your testimony thank you before i begin i want to remind all of us that every single one of us in this room knows someone who as a teenager started smoking and later developed a debilitating illness or died young from that please keep that person in mind as you consider this bill this bill and all of its iterations are designed to cause alarm and doubt about the public health approach it even goes so far as to propose to put false statements in state statute about the scientific evidence base the bill is designed to allow retailers who violate the law to continue to illegally sail to minors rather than hold law breaking retailers accountable the bill goes after municipalities and health entities that want to protect their kids we know how to prevent youth from starting smoking we have clear evidence about what does work and we also know what doesn't work you have heard examples from golden and rocky ford communities that have with our grantees have worked together to pass local retail licensing and you've heard from them that those programs have been successful we also know that licensing is a strong recommended strategy endorsed by multiple entities in public health we also know that the voters who approve these funds told the state of colorado that colorado should deter children and youth from starting to smoke and direct the funds be spent for community-based programs designed to reduce initiation of tobacco and use by children and youth so as stewards of these funds we are very careful to abide by the requirements in state statutes and voter intent by funding what works grantees are re the what they are doing has been mischaracterized and also taken out of context we know we also tell grantees what they cannot spend funds on they cannot do school assemblies they cannot do pig lug demonstrations things thank you for your testimony thank you ma'am committee are there any questions of this witness there are none thank you for being here today chris house and i would like for you to testify on how you would like to present yourself for the bill [Laughter] we're taking a little shift here excellent please state your name and who you represent madam chair my name is chris howes i'm the president of the colorado retail council members thank you for listening to my quick testimony today we are in favor of the bill as it was written and we are also in favor of the bill as it will be amended through zero zero five we represent um hundreds of large chain grocery stores that sell this product um and as i understand it as um the representative from the minneso league said this was a deal in 1973 to govern the sale of cigarettes what we're talking about what you've heard for the last half hour is otp other than tobacco other tobacco products not cigarettes so when you hear witnesses talking about smoking this is actually not about smoking this is about other tobacco products such as chew or dip or what have you and these local governments are passing licensing programs on otp so just to clarify what you're you're voting on today this is about other tobacco products being licensed at the local level we are in support of the amendment and hope you vote yes politics is the art of compromise this is really shooting right down the middle isn't it one side gets one thing more inspections the other side gets something else we believe those uh amendment 35 dollars are being used for lobbying thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for this witness there being none thank you for being here today thank you for listening mary lou chapman thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent thank you madam chairman members of the committee my name is mary lou chapman i'm the president of rocky mountain food industry association my members are are your local grocery stores throughout the various counties of this of the state our retailers take the sale of all tobacco products very seriously and we're very um supportive of this bill as mr house said both the original bill and the bill that that um you will find it amended to uh to be anyway the state show most of the stats show that overall colorado retailers are doing a very good job on compliance our store owners are also parents grandparents aunts and uncles of miners so they work very diligently with their employees to control the sale of all age restricted products because it's the right thing to do not because of penalties our retailer's view on the core issue here is pretty simple we don't believe any government agency or entity should allow our customers or their businesses tax dollars to be used to attempt to coerce or lobby other government agencies to further hassle or regulate our retailers who are already taking the necessary necessary steps to ensure compliance thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for this witness there being none thank you for being here today thank you greer bailey thank you for being here today please state your name and who you represent uh greg bailey i'm the executive director of the colorado petroleum marketers association um apparently i caused kind of a problem here um the uh so we got the retail community to introduce a bill that would uh double sales and minor penalties give uh yeah the good guys over the department of revenue more resources for enforcement um uh and that's probably not a good thing um i guess the uh the i don't understand how 12 million dollars is a penalty to that you guys give every year to local governments not to muck up uniformity consistency for the retail community i don't understand that um the lobbying prohibition is is limited in the amendment to taxes licenses and fees on business then go talk to them about whatever else they want um you know these you know this deal has been around for a while and it wasn't until about 2011 2012 that these local licenses started popping up and it was because the department of health gave start giving these these grant dollars these local public health organizations to try and go get these city councils to do it before that these licenses didn't exist so why the retailers were running a bill that would have increased enforcement uh doubled sales and minor penalties uh for the first time ever let the department know where everybody is all things that probably arguably are good for tobacco control um is because they're giving six million dollars to 27 local public health organizations to go out and to do this you know i am going to challenge the efficacy of the of the program because if you're giving six million dollars to to impose a 100 license on 5 000 or so retailers you're going to get a return of 500 000 thank you for your testimony mr greer committee are there any questions from mr greer representative rupe thank you madam chair and thank you mr bailey for being here earlier i heard someone say that this bill is really penalizing the ones that are following the law and missing the ones that are not following the law can you maybe answer some of that um concern mr bailey well thank you and thank you for the question um i i you know according to the department of revenue's website retailers are between 92 and 96 compliant that shifts every year a little bit and so really what these licenses do is impose a you know 150 license on generally 92 out of 100 retailers that are doing the right thing um the retailers think that's the wrong way to go if you really want to increase enforcement you or you really want to um increa you know or go after bad actors you increase enforcement dollars you know i i'm you know i appreciate that the efforts of the local the local community to address that but the math problem for these local for these local communities i mean you take a town like fountain who passed one of these ordinances you know they've got eight or nine gas stations call it four or five grocery stores you raise a hundred hundred fifty dollars i'm sorry i've got a bit of a cold um 150 dollars from 10 15 businesses a couple thousand bucks um you know i think that the better way to go would be to repurpose some of the six million dollars to the department of revenue to hire more inspectors so they can do a statewide comprehensive more enforcement that's what the bill originally intended to do that's kind of what the amendment still is trying to do it was i mean look at it this way my board gives me a lot of rope to hang myself every year in front of you guys and um if i brought if i brought you a bill that just doubled sales and minor penalties did increase enforcement on my guys um before all these local licenses existed well i i wouldn't be the executive director of cwpma so from that perspective this this money that the that the uh cdphe has given to all these local public health organizations has actually forced the retailers to come ask you for more uniformity more statewide compliance checks offering doubling sales to minor penalties you know offering an amendment that refer that remove the affirmative defense you know if you're if you're near a school i mean how are these bad things i mean i understand the the local control aspect um i i think that you know local licensure and local control you know that might be where we wind up eventually but without state guidance and oversight you're really putting the retailers in a tough spot um you know we did provide you a sample ordinance from huntington park california and you should really take a look at that because they do things in that ordinance that doesn't exist in colorado things like population control based licensing i mean we heard from our liquor store friends a little bit earlier and you know what if these licenses eventually evolve into something like that then you're devaluing the existing businesses that the people my association have uh invested in and um you know you put things like population control you say that if you're a primary tobacco retailer you're not allowed to be in business you know that's that's tough for existing retailers um and finally this is this is not a big tobacco bill this is a retailer's bill i don't i don't work for them i i work for the retailers um the uh i'm not sure what it surrogate really means but i i i'm the executive director of patrolling marketers and i'm trying to defer five hundred thousand dollars in unnecessary fees on a fairly compliant industry that's that's the purpose and i'm trying to trade more statewide enforcement that's kind of what the bill is supposed to be about thank you committee are there any further questions of our witness there being none thank you for being with us today mary serge mark thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent for the record thank you my name is mary zarmak i'm the uh with smoker friendly and gas mat a locally owned business out of boulder and good evening committee evening really come on so i'm here i think i'm the last though so i'll be quick and and succinct i think a lot of things have been said that need to be said so as i said i'm mary zara mack i'm the vice president of trade marketing and government relations for a third generation boulder-based company gas and mountain smoker friendly we're a colorado company that owns 102 stores and 55 of them are here in the state we pride ourselves in reinvesting in our company our communities and our state like many family businesses we have made sacrifices to make our company a success and be good employers in this state and others we're the largest one of the largest family owned employers in the state of colorado we're in the top 10 and we are the largest family-owned employer in our uh county in boulder county our industry as a whole remitted over 325 million dollars to the state of colorado last year in taxes for the last several years i've come down here to the capitol to try and be engaged and educate our legislature about our industry and about the fact that we are responsible retailers and take pride in the way that we do business somehow it seems that the public feels that every child that ever smokes is the responsibility of an irresponsible retailer that wants to profit from selling to a minor no business owners i know think that and in fact i just sat in a meeting with uh director mitch zeller from the fda center for tobacco tobacco product kid center for tobacco products at the fda last week and they reported that 86 of miners that smoke get cigarettes and other tobacco products from social sword sources which means they're not getting them from retail outlets and that's nationwide also in the state of colorado the fda had a 98 percent pass rate in their minor checks uh i think greer mentioned 92 to 96 that's on the state level and we have a 100 passage rate in both larimer and boulder counties by the way for both of my friends from my counties thank you for your testimony you're welcome committee are there any questions of this witness there are no thank you for being here today okay thank you committee that ends our witness testimony phase we do have mr patrick moroney here with the liquor and tobacco enforcement for questions would any of you like to bring up mr maroney okay is there anyone else in the audience who would like to testify on house bill 16 1370. there being none the witness testimony phase is now closed representative quorum we do have we do have our amendment in front of us and someone on the committee would like to remove that representative rosenthal thank you thank you madam chair actually i have a question for you procedural before we do that and i want to make sure that i don't have a settled question i do want to sever part of that amendment would that be done after that the amendment is proposed representative rosenthal would like to go ahead and and have a motion to move l005 let the sponsor speak to it and then we will discuss um how you would like to sever the bill and then make a ruling then does anyone want to move l005 there being none the chair will move l005 l05 has been moved by the chair and second by the vice chair representative quorum did you want to speak to this a little bit more well i i would just like to say that i think um you know as never being a smoker it uh makes about as much sense of me running this bill as as i did the iud bill last year but that seemed to be successful so we'll try this one but um uh i i think what we're i'm really concerned about and i'm going to go back to the audit uh auditor's request in 2012. and i have the copies of all the the formal ag opinions and to my knowledge um they didn't provide me that opinion on this case and i'm concerned that you know four years later we have a state auditor requesting information and it hasn't been done uh so i i think that is very concerning to me i think also the the fact that uh i think enforcement is probably the key to this um and i really believe that that is important and um i truly do question um whether we'd be money putting money better to use doing enforcement or doing lobbying and i think that is the main issue that we're trying to do in this amendment and uh with that i would ask you for yes vote representative garnett thank you madam chair and representative quorum does l005 narrow the title representative quorum you know i i i think it it it might i'm not sure i think there's i i'm not sure what uh representative rosenthal is wishing to sever um so i guess that was that was something i would be interested in also representative krantharp thank you representative quorum representative singer for bringing us this bill and for bringing us the amendments i don't disagree with the programming and the good work that people that um people in the community are doing mark johnson and jeffco uh health probably does the best of any of you so i just put that on the record because he is my jeffco health department and i am his biggest fan absolutely support all of the efforts this is my concern is that in 2004 the colorado voters approved amendment 35 a tax increase on cigarettes and other tobacco products the revenue was designated for health care services and tobacco education to improve the health of all coloradans that's from the cdphe uh website in 2012 the auditor questioned the use of the the dollars in terms of policy and advocacy and recommended made a recommendation that the ag issue an opinion around whether the dollars that the citizens voted in were correct the cdphe refused to follow through on that i found uh i came across this concern not seeing any of this other stuff brought it up to cdphe who told me you don't like it run legislation so i'm glad that um that you are doing this thank you very much so for that reason i worked in i'll be i'll be done for i have worked in non-profits all my life i get the concept that certain dollars should not be used for lobbying lobbying ma'am is not communication lobbying is is a totally different activity certain dollars should not be used for lobbying i believe that amendment 35 according to the purpose that the citizens voted in those dollars should not be used for lobbying and advocacy i'm a strong yes on this thank you representative rosenthal thank you ma'am sure is this the proper time to speak to severing part of this amendment representative rosenthal we had a conversation with the drafter and it's going to be very very complicated to sever this amendment and so the chair rules that we will not sever the amendment are there any objections to l zero zero five miss altman will you please take the role representatives aren't yes garnett no navarro yes nordberg yes pass rosenthal no rupe yes science yes thurlow yes winter yes west yes babone yes craft art yes madam chair no okay that amendment passes ten to three sponsors do you have any more amendments i do not committee are there any amendments the amendment phase is now closed sponsors would you like to make any closing comments um i would like to repeat what uh representative kraft larp said i think that's uh i think that's the basis of the bill um you know i think it's uh when we as legislators ask for information and departments deny that information i think it's up to us to get that information so i think what we're doing here is moving in the right direction and hopefully we will get the information we will also be adding more inspectors which i think is key uh rather than using money for lobbying thank you representative craftharp thank you madam chair i move house bill 16 1370 as amended to finance sorry um with favorable recommendation finance no physical note no i don't know it says it on my piece of paper do we have a second finance plan house bill 16 1370 has been moved to the committee on finance with a favorable recommendation as amended by representative kraft thorpe do we have a second by representative rosenthal is that correct no second representative nordberg ms altman will you i want to say a few words oh representative rosenthal has some closing comments thank you madam chair and you know i i wanted to sever this amendment because i i like half the bill and i don't like the other half uh the part that i don't like is the part that's banning the speech by uh public health groups to be able to make sure that we're enacting good policy at the local level and and that's the part that i wanted to eliminate uh the part that i did like is the part about um getting more inspectors which is we hear from everybody we need more inspectors therefore i wanted to support that part of the bill so since um but it has that poison pill the the first part that i mentioned so i'll be voting no any more closing comments ms altman will you please take the roll call representatives aren't no garnett no borrow no nordberg rosenthal no repay pass dice madam chair respectfully now and that bill fails 2 to 11. thank you gentlemen for coming before the yes representative navarro i would like to move to pa we have a motion by navarro to pi house bill 16 13 70 with a second fight representative rosenthal miss altman please take the roll call representatives aren't representative aren't pi yes garnett yes navarro representative rosenthal yes yes that motion passes 11 to 2. thank you committee members you
KN6clFDDI2g,CO,02-17-2016,here madam chair here well welcome to local government representative rankin please tell us about your bill house bill well thank you madam chairman always a pleasure to be back with local government having spent my first two years with you so so it's great to be back um and representative becker i believe is is intending to to show up i'll go ahead and try to get started without her but she and i share uh a passion for performance measurements kinds of activities and so we jointly wanted to sponsor this bill and it's it's important i'll just start by with a few comments we have uh several really good witnesses so i'm not going to take too much time on introduction but i did want to just give you a little perspective on why i think it's a great bill important bill and it really goes back i mean i personally feel very strongly about it and it really goes back to my days in the corporate world where i was i was involved in several big projects for quality management and changing processes and just really culture change and organizations both for my own the company that i work for but also for clients so i had a quite a long background in looking at these kinds of programs and i was really surprised and amazed and pleased when i you know got here when i got into government because all of a sudden i saw all these things that we were doing and a lot of people really dedicated to to making the processes work better to spending our money on the right things and so forth so um you know for example we've got the start the smart program smart act which we is a great program great data and we struggle with how well do you how to use that uh over on jbc and i'm sure you do in the committee but we also had the lean process you know human services has something called csat and i found going through these hearings in jbc here's representative becker who i should have let's start this off because she's just about as passionate as i am over these kinds of programs but i found sales in judicial and corrections for example you know a few people who are talking the language of evidence-based programs and performance measurement you know their efforts going on in our counties every county measures themselves in some way and tries to do better and a really big deal is this uh 1319 you know we actually are more aggressive than most states in trying to fund higher education through performance so we've got a lot of really good stuff going on in fact i think colorado is a national leader you know from what i've researched i've done on other states we literally are a national leader in trying to measure what we do to make it better and to fund the things that make a difference so i've been really impressed with all of that and what we've done and more lately um the office of state planning and budget and director sobane is i think going to talk to us a little bit engaged with the pew foundation a couple years ago now and did something called results first and this bill is actually named for it could be named performance measurement but we actually called it results first bill because that's been a a really interesting effort they went out and inventoried a lot of our programs and tried to apply some of these principles of measurement well for the first time in joint budget committee you know our jbc analyst actually picked up on results first and twice on two different line items when we had our briefing the analyst said hey here's what the results first team found and that was really great you know because we're starting to look at evidence on whether a program is cost effective or not you know whether it's doing what we want that doesn't mean we'll do away with it it means that we might fine tune it we might find those that do good and and take a hard look at those that don't i mean you can't draw quick conclusions but it's evidence you know it's starting to boil up so so you might say why do we need this bill what's this bill all about because there's a lot of good things happening already well to me we need to capitalize on on these really good things that we're already doing you know and that means that we can if we kind of pull them together we can raise awareness with all of our fellow legislators and with the jbc staff and we can motivate people to think even more about performance you know whether things are working or not and we're not talking about this build is not new processes we're not talking about reinventing the wheel we're actually not talking about any new requirements on counties or on on departments we're actually just talking about inventing a common language for example does anybody really have a good idea what evidence based means i mean we throw that term around a lot but you know is there a real definition well i we found through research that some other states have actually defined that we have definitions in this bill for the first time that will put in statute what we mean when we talk about evidence-based and theory-based programs and we can then share the knowledge across departments maybe something is working well in one county that another county can use one department that another county can use and we can focus funding on what really works uh and and when times get tough so but but the one thing that i want to make a point we are not this is about methodology you know we're not talking about some super group here that's going to make decisions and recommend closing programs or new programs this is about getting a common language for the methodology across these programs and the processes and it's also let's let's be sure we're not this doesn't mean we're not going to try good ideas that people come up with it doesn't mean that we're never going to experiment or do something because we think it may pay off we're still going to have to leave a lot of room for innovation within our departments so that's what it's all about i really think we can accelerate even past where we are on performance measurement on uh cost-effectiveness in all of our programs so i think it should be clear that i feel pretty strongly about the bill and i know my my buddy here does so i take it away i was going to becker thank you madam sharon thank you committee um for hearing house bill 1209 so um i'm going to paraphrase ronald reagan for a second and ronald yes and ronald reagan said there's no such thing closer to eternal life than the closest thing to eternal life is a government program meaning once a government program exists it's really hard to ever end it and um and i think that that's a um fair statement because things can can get into an existence and then if they aren't evaluated regularly um they just continue on and so i think it's important for us as as the stewards of this state of taxpayer dollars to be evaluating um our programs and making sure they make sense that they're evidence-based that they're cost efficient etc so really this bill just by putting the results first initiative into statute this way it means that governor staff is really going to be proactively thinking about program evaluation and it institutionalizes the commitment to evidence-based evaluation so that's really what we're doing here i think all of us believe that we should be making sure our programs make sense so that's that's kind of the gist of the bill rosenthal uh thank you madam chair and thank you representatives for bringing this bill and uh so i'm sorry i came in a little bit late uh so i didn't really hear some of the presentation from representative rankin so if you don't mind outlining and perhaps we'll hear from the governor's office more on this but what are the current efforts that are undertaken i thought the governor's office already had some um you know some processes in place or programs in place to you know seek greater efficiency and slim down government etc so what is the status of that and to that extent are those efforts going to be looped into this one unified bill representative rankin well i did run through some of those and i'll certainly leave some out but you know we start with the results first program itself which is i believe about two years old partnership with the pew foundation and a charitable trust in it it actually went out and inventory things that are going on uh throughout the state uh and applied evidence from other states to that so that's one the lean process itself to make better processes the smart act which you've you've experienced and seen a lot with uh they're in their things within and sitting on the joint budget committee i've seen sales of folks from corrections and judicial for example come talk about evidence-based programs counties all have various efforts i would list 1319 higher education performance measurement as one of those so i'm sure i'm leaving out some and perhaps uh maybe the witnesses can talk about some others but so this is not to create anything new it's to try to bind those programs together and and you know exchange best practices and to invent a common language and i i don't know if you're here i said probably we hadn't we didn't have a haven't had a good definition of what evidence-based even really means and so we're putting those definitions in statute so we can have a common language to talk about the outcomes for the program that the intent is not that this program would actually produce results in other words i don't see this advisory committee coming back to legislation and saying this is a bad program or a good program i see this committee talking about what are the best ways to evaluate this methodology not outcome that help within fair law oh thank you madam chair thank you representative rankin and becker just a question i certainly support the concept and i like you know the whole idea of lean processes and i've been through some of those and think that that's exactly what we need in government my my question to you for a discussion as we and maybe this some of your witnesses will discuss this too as we go along is can we you know you can do it in an executive kind of an organization where somebody has some power to to do things and and direct programs and even fire people if you have to we as a legislative body i wonder if we have the same ability to to do that and i guess i what i would question or ask you to comment on is that you know the original group is set up with 10 members i think they're all appointed by the governor which i guess is okay and then the working group can create advisory committees and members and and those people are appointed by the working group chair so is there any possible danger of committee after committee um growing and and and getting us into a process that we then can't control or how are we going to take the process which i think is a good idea and control it to actually get results and and keep it from being just committees doing committee work representative becker or rankin who would like glenn sure oh so we do have an amendment that's going to clarify the the membership of the committee um that's just an aside because you said 10 members all appointed by the governor and i think we're changing that slightly um and your um i i guess what you're asking is well hey does this committee just meet and do do nothing or spawn additional committees you know um the the bill just um these people could meet as a committee without the bill but we want to and could talk about best practices for program evaluation until the cows come home with or without this bill what we want to actually do is really institutionalize it and create the common definitions and make it a regular ongoing practice because different governors different administrations can have different priorities um we just want to show a commitment of this by the state to evidence-based evaluation and programs and so we want to continue having folks thinking about what are the best ways to um to make sure we are building program evaluation and program capacity to do evidence evidence-based decision making is in rankin just to further that i mean we already have you know every uh power ability your committee my my joint budget committee we can start new programs or close programs down so it's not about that it's it's not about exercising that authority which i think you ask it's about so from my perspective sitting on a joint budget committee when you know we cover an awful lot of material fast when my analyst comes in and says this is an evidence-based program i want i want to make sure i know what that means or this is a theory program you know we'd like to try something new and it's a theory-based program we don't have good evidence from other states that it works i want to know what that means i want that common language to apply when somebody comes and testifies to you here in local government you know i want that and that's what we're doing we're putting those definitions in statutes so that we have a common language this is really a pretty unique thing it's only other one other state who's really done this and believe it or not it's the state of mississippi which by the way i grew up in but the uh you know they actually and put these definitions in place and then ask their departments to go out and do an inventory of all their programs we're not going quite that far you know we're not forcing anything on the departments but we are creating the definition so that when they come back to us we know what it means thank you madam chair just want to follow up do you think it should have a sunset just so that in five years or some period of time again yeah i think there's a you know 19 yeah oh i apologize it does in three years yeah and i agree it possibly should if we get the job done sorry madam chairman taking license with you president art so uh thank you very much madam chair is the results first is that the standardized program i mean is it a what is it i mean i i see the words here but is it a i'm just worried when we put in statute uh uh a methodology what if and i'm glad to set sunsets in three years then they have to follow the law of results first whatever that is for three years what if there's a results first plus that comes out i was saying that rankin or i don't know my my view is maybe we should have called it performance measurement yes it's really not intended to zero in on one methodology thank you that helps represent background thank you madam chair and it actually does it's not this isn't a trademarked or a specific um method that we are committing to it's um the existing program yes is a partnership between the general assembly and the governor's office using um a results first model but it's not but you can use the term broadly too thank you representative navarro thank you madam chair so we have this group consisting of up to 10 members of those 10 members this bill is saying that only two are going to be paid is that correct or are all 10 staff members plus two appointed by the governor going to be reimbursed by expenses as well i think what the fiscal note i think you're referring to and i think what it's implying is these are people already working on these techniques in the department so it's actually really is i mean the departments have come back and said yes that person is already working on smart act or strategic plan or something in a department so it's not an additional cost and i think that's where that comes from representative navarro okay so to be clear there are 10 staff already being paid to do this and we're we're asking for the governor to appoint two more staff to be paid representative becker so the working group is are are people that the governor would appoint who already exist um they might be heads of different departments i think it specifies um yeah so those are just existing staff members appointed to a working group there are two people in the governor's office who work on this program evaluation now um and this bill doesn't change that so it is not hiring new people the working group isn't there are not 10 staff members but maybe that's a question that's better answered by um henry sobini representative navarro so then what is the expense for the reimbursement for the two extra staff that's going to be appointed representative i think what the bill specifies is that the folks who are appointed to the working group can be um reimbursed of any necessary expenses related to his or her participation so that i could be travel expenses or if you meet over lunch i guess it could be your lunch expense that's but again i'm i will defer to mr sobine um on on that but it's not these are not new staff members representative navratra so then this bill is just focusing on the six meetings that we're going to be reimbursing them for to attend representative becker the bill focuses on the the creation of a results first working group the fiscal note if that's what you mean i think we could have the fiscal note analyst walk you through it if you want i don't want to say anything wrong and uh the way i read this representative tomorrow i'm looking on page two because if they're already employed with the state then their salary is already incorporated but what i see in that was the first second third paragraph at the legislative department it outlines here that it is assumed that the working group will meet six times per year and will require this 13 000 for the two fte from these two organizations to staff the working group so i don't know if that helps but it helped me kind of understand you know maybe the line of questioning i don't know if that's helpful representative lebsock i think that is helpful madam chair and also um because representative becker did say we're already talking about the the folks who would make up this working group we might want to have the conversation about what the amendment might look like at the front end of the hearing so that we kind of know what you're talking about because we're already talking about members of the working group and so as we start thinking about what this working group looks like it might be a good idea of of having an all the committee members understand what you're going to be asking of the committee to vote on later on madam chair i know it's not part of the amendment phase now but i think it might be important for us to discuss who the folks are going to be on this working group and who's appointing them and so forth and while our staff is uh passing out the amendment i have a question because i'm trying to get a visual on how this works and what i'm thinking about at this point is similar how ccjj is set up are you guys familiar with that commission and basically that commission kind of comes together once a month and they do have subgroups but basically they're recommending policy as it relates to criminal justice so i'm using that as a reference for maybe what this committee i just want to make sure i understand this right so this committee is going to come together and they're going to look at areas for opportunities for efficiency or whatever the um the the project that they're working on ways that in which we can do things better and then they're going to go back and bring those ideas to the elected officials to recommend new policy if you can just kind of explain to me the operational impact how you envision this plan out manager i think that's fair um i would let's take some specific examples let's take the smart act and you know i think it would be appropriate for this group to look at the smart act at a department and see how that integrates with that department's strategic planning with its budget process with its any uh lean process it's the integration of the various things that that are going on that we're really looking toward methodology so let's say in the smart act you know it doesn't reflect uh perhaps there's a a program that through results first we found is questionable you know we don't have good results does the smart act contain objectives to correct that program so it's it's it's trying to integrate the findings from various ways of looking at our programs so it's more about methodology i don't see we don't see this program this this committee coming back and saying this program is no darn good you ought to get rid of it you know that's not its function that's right i thought it had red hair somewhere one was to recommend policy practice but maybe i misread something so you're saying method methodology so you're going to be looking at a specific organization and how they do their work if there is another best practice for doing that work then this committee will recommend those processes or those strategies to the department is that what you're saying this function would do that that's a correct i believe madam chairman that's correct would i think honestly the person that's best able to describe what they're going to do is uh director sobane okay and i think he's signed up to testify okay oh any other questions for the bill sponsors seeing none we'll move into testimony phase and so who who would you like to bring up first we have two people who have signed up one against and one four any preference for or against opposition let's have director 7a first texas please come forward and introduce yourself and who you represent thank you madam chair my name is henry sobine i'm the director of the office of state planning and budgeting welcome thank you very much i'm pleased to be here in support of house bill 1209 um i'm at your service i have some opening statements and comments and i can also address some of the questions that have come up as well please proceed with your opening remarks um the um the results first project started two sessions ago with pretty much an unprecedented partnership between the legislative branch and the executive branch each side providing resources to pursue a statistical investigation based on research from across the country around how to determine the return on a dollar spent in a certain program and the the machine as we kind of jokingly refer to it has been developed by some foundations and given to states who want to participate in the program for free but learning about the machine figuring it out figuring out what what each state does and doing that extra work required resources so resources were um established at ospb and they continued today in our baseline budget um and so the first look in the program was juvenile justice and adult corrections we're moving now to early childhood and mental health issues um to give you an example uh from how the research came to pass one of the on on the positive end of the spectrum of research that has been conducted is on the nurse home visitor program and so research from the the results first model shows that a dollar pays out well more than a dollar back in terms of costs avoided or cost benefit on the other side a program called scared straight was evaluated to actually cost money a dollar invested and youths put through the program were actually disadvantaged by their participa participation even though the ideas beforehand seem to indicate some intuition about moving forward and so when we look at this what we're trying to understand is are we spending money in a way that represents uh the the best likelihood to do it the right way now there's a lot of concern based on our feedback so far on the bill that we've heard as well as when we started the program that somehow this methodology or this statistical analysis will take away the judgment from the executive branch or the legislative branch or that this is some sort of mechanism to just reduce budgets without justification or with justification that came out of a box i think that so far that those fears have not come to pass the the results that came out of the first phase have have manifested in in a request to reallocate resources to a pilot program in community corrections where we feel like we can do a better job relative to what we have been doing and then if that pans out then we can expand that improvement to other areas in community corrections for example another thing to consider is that by getting a better inventory of what we're doing around the state is that when we have the inevitable next downturn we don't have a comprehensive knowledge of what programs should be protected from cuts so we've been through severe downturns in the last 15 years in our general fund negative 15 each time and we've gone into those without a methodologically based assessment of where some of our largest programs are and what the return is so if we need to cut the budget sadly we have those abilities and we've done that over the last many years legislatively or through the executive branch recommendation process so we view this very much as an investigation education learning chance to use scarce resources in the best way possible and create an environment where it's not audit based most of the performance evaluation right now that happens in the state government is out of performance audits and that's a very intimidating process for programs to go through um to the extent i have influence on on the committee whatever shape it takes if the bill is successful i mean this is meant to be a learning and investigation process so that we can move resources to where they're most effective um it's it's more the case programs come to my office and say i need more and we've used smart act lean performance management in other ways to make sure we're doing the best with what we have before we add so i hope that calms a few of the concerns that are out there now i know there'll be more with respect to the appropriation if i may um rep navarro you had a question about the fiscal note i think it was prepared to acknowledge that there would be some administrative or travel expenses in the conducting of the work um notably potentially needing outside experts to come help educate um how things are done elsewhere or ways that our program could improve i can tell you that we don't have any intention of hiring resources with if the fiscal note gets appropriated to our office as i mentioned earlier we have permanent resources now from the joint budget committee in our long bill section for this program so it it reflects the time commitment that we will be spending in in the committee um and then any incidental expenses related to that representative singer thank you madam chair um so and thank you for being here director stephanie uh this is an interesting idea um you know i was just on the results first pew page talking about the scared straight where it was you know seemed like it made sense it was 67 per participant um until we till they discovered that it was 13 000 as a cost to the state and future criminal behavior um so you know the one to two hundred dollar ratio isn't particularly good use of state dollars um my question is in terms of process and i apologize if the bill sponsors already responded to this how does this relate or not to the lean process that's already being implemented is it director thank you madam chair rep singer that's a great question so what we um have now is a kind of portfolio of good government or delivering results type activities in the office of state planning and budgeting so the lean program is is meant to teach state employees and to facilitate um you know basically elimination of waste from existing standard processes and to try to to get more out the back door or save time save money etc this is different from lean from the point of view of what is the return on one on a dollar expended so it's it's more of a cost benefit calculation now lean could be used to make your cost benefit better but this is more uh using existing academic and other experiences that are in the database to determine if you're conducting say drug treatment or community corrections or early childhood some kind of programming are you adhering to the techniques that work the best are you delivering them in the ways that have proven to be profitable and it's more investigation of fidelity to doing it right lean can certainly be parallel and used when we're examining but it is distinct and it's a different skill set it's not related to the database and and we we use it in other areas where this would not apply there's there is some tendency that um this will make us a chicken sandwich and do our dry cleaning and it's certainly not that it is a tool kit to improve our learning and and that's what it is it's it it cannot do that much and and again to emphasize it's not meant to take away the judgment in the system it was an art thank you madam chair so i this he had a good question this might be a bad question but i'll ask it anyway so with the severance tax dollars tier two programs and they're when they when we reduce reduce them proportionally or or we reduce them all that that's well yeah would we ever apply something like this to that to make better decisions than if we want to prioritize some of those programs director thank you ma'am chair um representative arn i i think that we will have to use our bandwidth wisely for where we start with the committee um i think that automatic proportional cuts in the statute you know were agreed to pri previously and that doesn't mean that that was the best decision or the right decision i think there are some programs in tier two that could be analyzed using this technique um and that's that's where you would stop and then you would say okay did the analysis capture the pros or the cons of that of of the program completely and then from there we move forward should we add more should we status quo should we take away represent art thank you that's what i would hope happened further question is representative thurlow thank you madam chair thank you i'm just curious of the committee is the nonprofit membership association somebody you need for specific information or director thank you ma'am chair um representative thurlow our intention was to proceed with this analysis and these meetings in a way that reflects the structure of colorado government and colorado's government in in large part is a locally controlled state supervised system and so in the first go around we worked with counties and and and judicial districts and so that membership classification that you're referring to is meant to continue um interfacing with local government representatives as we proceed in looking at where money is spent and how it's spent so i think you're hearing from the next from from someone from that group but you're not supposed to put specific people in statutes so did you have a follow-up representative representative lebsock thank you madam chair and i i've got a question for the director um director silvane when i was first on city council i i um liked a lot of what the council had been doing over the years um had followed them closely and uh but there were um certain things um obviously i wanted to change and be a part of or that's the reason why i ran for city council and so when i first was on city council i i was very careful in in stating that i think that we needed to measure our success um i think is a way where we could describe this bill um correct me if i'm wrong um there's a lot of things the state is doing well and i think it's important for us to measure that success and and identify the areas that we are excelling at and at the same time might be able to find some things that we need some continuous improvement on um i think that's a um a good way to explain that's that's what i thought when i first read the bill that we were measuring our success and finding ways to do continuous improvement is that a fair assessment of the bill in general ma'am chair rep lebsock thank you yes i think this is one way to help us measure our success and one way to continue our continuous improvement ideas i think continue this is one way and one technique to investigate how we're spending money and if we're being successful i think one one nuance here that's been interesting is this this uh methodology is meant to measure uh cost benefit and so we may have a program that's highly effective but very expensive and that's where kind of the judgment comes in because some of the benefits that this program evaluates are not monetary benefits they're monetized so somebody's time a crime that isn't committed or a job that's that's been achieved something like this um so i i think it's one way to measure our success i think there's other ways to measure as well thank you um and director i have a question to you and maybe the bill sponsors because when i look on page five in the bill when i was talking about the the committee it does say here unless i'm not reading this right it says to make legislative policy and budgetary recommendations to the general assembly the governor's office the executive branch agency agencies regarding program evaluation practices so it does have that component in it can you talk a little bit more about that madam chair yes i'd be happy to um i think that the the investigation the work the findings um we have we've tried to um approach this this new methodology in in a way that where the separation of powers and the different uh you know protections and kind of camps that that have traditionally existed we've tried to set those aside and find some common ground and a way to work together because at the way the process works the governor will make a recommendation either requesting for money or changing and the legislature has to have some basis for making that evaluation then making the recommendation and appropriating the money and so this is one almost small little neutral zone where people can get together and examine things and see if they see the data the same way and how would they proceed to go forward so i don't think we have a template yet of what the how the recommendations will manifest themselves you can see in the bill there isn't language that takes away existing powers from either branch and i think that's that isn't what anybody wants both both existing legislatures and existing governors can ignore what the committee says um but this continuing research can add to our knowledge and uh provide a basis for for decisions for adding subtracting and again i think during downturns this knowledge will probably pay some dividends that we weren't able to take advantage of in the past yeah i i tend to agree because i think if you're going to be convening these thought leaders and all these people and they've had an opportunity to kind of sift through the data it would just make good common sense to come up with some recommendations that we could deploy to accomplish the objective that's been outlined in this bill so to have them come together and not come up with recommendations or policy solutions would be wasteful in my mind thank you we agree we think we should demonstrate what we learned and um i think what we've what we've seen so far is it it moves the ball ahead just a little bit continuous improvement where we know more we also learned things that we didn't know in the past and we discovered some things that we still don't know so i think the recommendations will just reflect that continuing learning process that will exist in the executive and legislative branches about the programs we're paying for and are they working further questions for the director seeing none thank you for your service and your time today thank you i'd like to bring up our next witness miss pergino did you know please come forward introduce yourself all right um madam chair members of the local government committee my name is jenny penjino and i'm here on behalf of colorado counties incorporated we are the association of elected county commissioners in the state and the county commissioners discussed this bill um last thursday at their tax and finance steering committee and um they they take they took an opposed position and i would like to go into some detail about why that is because i i really appreciate some of the comments that i've heard from both representative becker representative rankin and um the director of ospb henry sobinay and i i think that they are hitting on the concerns that the county commissioners um flagged in our meeting um and to speak to a comment that henry just made which is really gets to the heart of it um his comment was this is not meant to take away the judgment in the system and i think the concern that the county commissioners had um is that the the conclusion of the work group will be a very black and white and or slash and burn approach so that they will look at evaluation tools such as cost-benefit analysis and or adherence to a fidelity model if one exists and that they will gauge um you know programs that are being offered at the county level and make a determination on possibly those two um items alone that no this program costs way too much um and and does the benefit is um really minimal um and would that lead the group to conclude that this program that might be uh one that is really embraced by the community is one that should no longer exist the same with kind of the fidelity model a lot of the programs that counties administer in the state for the state do have a fidelity model but there could be really good reasons why there isn't um a hundred percent adherence to fidelity model it could be that um in kiowa county they have realized that um if they tweak something this way or that way they're able to resonate with clients better um or perhaps the reason why we are not a hundred percent adherence to a fidelity model is because we're not being um uh we don't it's it's a slightly unfunded mandate um so there are all these nuances that the commissioners were focused on when they talked about this bill and they were very concerned that um the conclusions from the group would be used in a slash and burn type approach i as my opening comments led into i really appreciate the comments that representative becker made representative rankin made and henry sobinay and i would like to continue working with them if they are amenable to maybe um i i think what's so that the concern here is what's not said in the bill what's kind of quiet in the bill so if for example program evaluation could have some more guard rails on it so it's not just cost-benefit evaluation and fidelity model but other types of the factors that could be you know added to the mix before a conclusion is made about whether a program's good or bad i think that would provide a lot of comfort for the county commissioners we do have great confidence again and the sponsors and the current administration um but three years from now i i i worried that there will be a concern about what was the intent what was the intent behind this bill and things that are sometimes not stated in law leaves a big question mark and has you know we've all seen this happen people start kind of spiraling maybe in a different direction so i guess while the county commissioners are opposed i i'm encouraged by the discussion i've had to date with the leaders and if they are amenable i'd really like to continue looking for potential amendments that could address some of the county commissioner's concerns can you um direct me to what section of the bill that you're concerned about that you think it needs to be edited uh or amended and then i'd like to hear from the bill sponsors if you would entertain such thoughts now what which section are you looking at where you're thinking that there's some perception that would mean that you're just that they're just going to cut out a program where is that at um thank you madam chair and members of the committee um one one area is page five lines four through seven it was actually the language that you pointed to a moment ago and this gets to the um the therefore yeah um part of the the conversation um and a lot of this is the the unknown we don't know what kind of conclusions the working group will um come to and so it is that um you know grappling with well how will this be used and what will be the conclusions um so it's that piece it's um uh you know again i think it might be more of what is not said in the bill than what is said in the bill so if for example the group was amenable to really specifying that this group is to look at the methods um of of evaluation and the different types of evaluation that can be um you know factored into the the mix i think that would that kind of thing would help i don't have specific language right now just kind of conceptualizing thank you for sharing that because i'm i'm having a hard time seeing you know how this program will actually tell a county that they're going to cut a program i'm and i'm not seeing that but representative becker did you want to go well i will call your attention to page 5 land 21. it says evaluation practices in previous line regarding evaluation practices that means methodology so i hope that the bill i know that there's some concern about saying yes or no in a specific program but the bill is meant to focus on methodology and practice rather than drawing conclusions although certainly from time to time i think the committee would be offering to you and to jbc and other committees you know some outcome-based uh information so i the intent is to focus on practice and i will point out that we trying to listen to the concerns of the counties if you go back to your amendment which we'll be offering it does and you know try to specify that it's just state-funded programs so those two those two comments thank you representative representative i think uh madam chair you took most of what my question was going to be i was going to specifically ask what is not said in this bill that needs to be said i think that was partially your your question um jenny you know that i have a soft spot in my heart for local governments right because i and the reason why i do is because i know that they're concerned about results right because local governments like counties and cities actually care actually deal with people day-to-day on day-to-day issues and local governments are absolutely critical and meaningful and so i really appreciate your testimony um is it not important and and i and i think and i'm trying to remember um back 10 years ago when i was on city council when we had the real tough discussion about who we want to be as a city first right i mean who do we want to be as we had town halls and we talked to our constituents we found out who we wanted to be as a city and then we started to come up with specific programs for lack of a better word to try to get us to where we wanted to be and for a couple years we felt really good about those programs and we felt really good about the goal that we were trying to reach but there was at one point i had to raise my hand and i said don't we need to measure our success don't we need to look back and see if we're actually reaching the goal that we wanted to to be at and so for me that's what this does and i can see that if you're a county that receives state funding for any number of programs that are absolutely critical for our our citizens um to have a um you know a good life in our counties in our cities right um it would be at first glance it might be a little bit intimidating and and i could understand why some folks would have some questions but generally speaking would you not agree that counties and i'll leave it at counties because you represent counties do this probably at every single advance or retreat that they have do they not miss personnel oh yes okay thank you representative flops websock um no i i agree and um i hope it is not coming across am um testimony here that we are opposed to evaluation uh i think really the piece that i'm uh kind of piling on to again is the comment that this is this alone this working group is not meant to take away judgment in the system and it's that um you know there there are other reasons for why a program should continue on it may not pin out from a cost benefit analysis it may not pin out because of a fidelity model or lack thereof but as long as this working group is it has got their eyes on all of these other reasons kind of maybe the softer touchy feelier reasons as to why a program is just awesome for the community that's the kind of thing that i i just want to make sure that the working group has and so it you might after doing all this measuring you might not find that you have a huge return on investment an roi on a particular program but that program helps you get to where you want to be you've identified it as a state priority as a county priority and it might not have a great roi and you're not might be able to point exactly to this is you know the best spent dollars in the state it may not be the best spent dollars in the state but it's important for your community i i get it i i'm certain that the the bill sponsors will continue to work with cci and um on this yeah i'd like to hear the bill sponsor's response to some of the concerns from cci what are your thoughts representative beckham thank you madam chair and i think um director sobane said it so well and when he said it doesn't remove the judgment piece um any and and representative rankin said it well when he said you know this really does focus about methodology and again we're trying to institutionalize the the goal of evidence-based decision making but um the the result is if the if the committee does come up with the legislative or policy recommendation it doesn't happen automatically that goes to the legislature for decision making there's hearings there's just like anything now it doesn't shortcut that doesn't short circuit that process there's always opportunity for discussion or um argument and counter argument so i i i think it's important that the state have a commitment to regularly evaluating programs and determining the cost benefit analysis but you know in any given instance that doesn't mean we will only be doing one thing it's not a slash and burn but it is a uh a like i said just a a commitment to um examining our programs and we we need to be doing that you know we have to remember that the counties implement state programs they may also have some of their own programs and we've our amendment clarifies this is only about state programs not about any accounting programs they might be doing on their own but the counties do implement state programs and there could be something that the group evaluates that counties implement but they are not going to be left out of the conversation and what i'm hearing is the county is not objecting to evaluations it's something beyond that are there any other questions represent thurlow well thank you madam chair thank you mr pagino for being here do you take the the article five on page four the non-profit membership association appointment as being a voice for counties or cities or both or you know is there a distinction there should it be i guess my question do cities and counties need separate voice or is one voice good enough for the purposes of the bill to to represent local organizations except for mr pedro thank you madam chair um representative thurlow um let's see i'm reading this as i'm talking which is always dangerous but it looks like it's at least one member would be from a non-profit membership association whose purpose is to offer assistance to county commissioners mayors and council members and you know certainly having more than one guaranteed would be helpful to make sure that our voice is at the table but i i do think that is intended to get the county voice in the work group what was insane thank you madam chair and and i think um this pendulum brings them some great points this bill is fairly wide open and so um also i wanted to let representative blebsock know that every time you say thornton city council i'm going to take a drink of my zero calorie energy-based drink left side thank you madam chair and you do that representative saying um i wanted to uh to follow up with uh representative thurlow's question because i think he had a good one is is there um also is this bill also intended to look at state programs that might be administered by cities and that would be to represent a franklin or or uh representative becker representative rankin well i i do think we try to clarify that in the uh in the amendment which says means a state administered state supervised or state-funded program and state funded so those things are inclusive so the answer would be yes for example you know denver i guess runs their own human services i don't know i'm not familiar with sydney run programs administered by the state so are you thank you madam chair i was just going to say i i don't know having been on a city council i don't know of any state programs that the cities may administer um but again we have an amendment to clarify we're talking about state programs only and um and i just want to you know there's been emphasis this this year on government efficiency and that's exactly what this bill gets to um so you can't we don't want a process in in a recession year any other year that's just slash and burn this is supposed to be a thoughtful to to spur a thoughtful process in figuring out where we need to if or where we need to scale back and be inclusive and how we do the evaluations so anyway i just have to throw that in because um because i thought it needed being said for the questions of this witness uh representative rankin may i respond to the county concerns cause i consider myself a real champion of local control and county government i hope i stay that way so you know i we're absolutely willing to work with cci in any way necessary and i think the representation might be that came up might be something to consider but i did want to point out you know i visited uh particularly human services county level because i want to see what state programs look like and they actually measure themselves very well in some cases and and you know in my view this committee would look for best practices to the counties to see how they because you know they're really in contact with client and and and do some very good tracking programs so i hope that we pull some of those techniques back into this uh this committee's discussions thank you um for that because i think it's helpful to wordsmith it if it's going to help our counties to be more aligned and if it's just a couple of words then i think we could probably get there okay any other questions for this witness seeing none is there anyone else out there that would like to testify on house bill 1209 if not we're going to close the testimony portion of this hearing and now the bill is on the table for any amendments representative singer madam chair i move l01 second it's been moved and seconded by representative lebsock is there any have you guys read it before i are there any objections to that amendment [Applause] seeing none the amendment passes are there any other amendments from the committee seeing none we're going to close the amendment phase um are there any comments before we take final action representative becker i'm just going to repeat myself so this is not hiring new staff it is um exactly getting it government efficiency which is a theme for the year i think and but it also doesn't mean slash and burn it means thoughtful analysis of where what programs work and what programs don't work and i think um i think it's what every state and local government should be doing and i i think there's an opportunity to work with the counties and i think rep rankings correctly said that this this actually provides an opportunity to look to the county's four best practices representative saying was first thank you madam sharon i want to thank the bill's sponsors for bringing this bill forward i do seem to recognize some language that came from bill from last year that i'm sad see it didn't go anywhere however i'm going to say that i have some concerns about this bill and listening to some of the testimony when i hear things like the softer side of audits because osa audits are too stressful for certain programs well i think if we receive or any department or any program receives government funding i think the audits are are very important tools so i see this is possibly and potentially becoming a gateway i know that's not the intention but potentially gateway for getting around the audit process to maybe keep programs around their uh political appointees pet project or something that's close to somebody's heart rather than actually initiating the best practices and on page five line 25 you mentioned ronald reagan earlier but we're establishing a state office of program evaluation and i can't help but think of scene in the wizard of oz at tower scene and thinking of sustainable government bureaucrats flying everywhere from the state office of program evaluation putting in practices common standard for the entire state for all these programs so i'm a little concerned i would like to see the bill narrowed quite a bit i understand the uh the objective and it's very honorable and it's and it's a good objective but i think right now the bill is a little too wide for me to vote affirmatively on i'd like to see some amendments maybe on the floor and i'll discuss that with the bill sponsors at a later time further comments represent singer uh thank you madam chair i know you know whether it's the city of north glenn city of north clinton no okay uh city of north carolina or mine oh okay or or or or boulder county um you know i i look at this bill and i think about um you know the audit process is is an onerous one that doesn't always need to happen it's costly to the state it's costly and and ultimately costly to the taxpayers um the state's money is not really the state's money in my opinion is the taxpayers money whether it's you know city dollars or county dollars or state supervised dollars these are taxpayer dollars that um go directly um to services and and so you know i i like the idea of this bill and the thing that i would encourage both the bill sponsors and the um as well as director sobine and um and cci to look at is if this has been done in 19 other states we can look at this model and say you know what this has been a slash-and-burn model in eight of those 19 states or 20 or not 20 but 19 of those 19 states well i'm not using the rever results first model okay so i but um but in 19 of the 19 it's been slash and burn i mean we we have some factual basis for for concern or not for concern and you know the lack of what's being said is is probably more of a issue for a relationship counselor than it is for for lawyers to worry about but we can look at what 19 other states have done and see whether or not this has been created a slash and burn model or whether it's created a more thoughtful process that makes sure that the taxpayers dollars are best being spent whether those are state dollars from the state or state dollars administered to local governments and so i'll be in support of the bill but i look forward to hearing back from whether it's the bill sponsors or director sobine or cci about whether or not this is this has borne itself out as a slash and burn process in in other states and if so why for the comments was in rankin oh thank you madam chair just to wrap up a little bit i mean i view the audit process as an integral part of evaluation i do not view it as a separate nor is this a replacement secondly it does not create a state office of evaluation it merely says in one line that that's something we should consider so that that is not an accurate statement does it create common standards it does not it looks across all these programs to create a common language of communication now let me speak from the perspective of the joint budget committee you know we want evaluations we need evaluations because we we fund to current law but we also try to put you know we also have the responsibility to look at operations of departments to look for programs that are failing and those that are successful we had two examples this year first time we've had them the visiting nurse program great cost-effectiveness really good no question that we should fund it to maximum we had another program in corrections intensive residential treatment program which did not come out cost effective but you know what our analyst said that's not good data i want to go back and evaluate that we did not make a decision just because results first gave us the answer because our analyst said there's more to this so it's not a slash and burn that is not an accurate description it's informative it's evaluative and it's going to help all of us be more efficient if you believe in measurement you can't fix what you can't measure i learned that in industry a long time ago if you believe in good government if you believe in spending money appropriately then you believe in measuring programs and evaluating them and also exercising human judgment on top of that thank you madam chairman wow you said that with passion representative rosenthal thank you and i i certainly admire that passion representative rankin and and i i certainly agree with you and um you know uh i think colorado we have a very good state government i think it's effective i think that we do a lot of things well and but as with any organization whether it's a company or non-profit or government that we can always use improvement and i think this is regular ongoing best practices improvement and i support that so i'll be voting yes on the bill further comments seeing none damien please call the role oh we have to move the bill all that passion just threw me off balance a little bit it's going to the uh we'd like to move the bell didn't someone okay representative thank you so yeah we're friends are sending friends to a probe today um so i move house bill 1209 as amended to the committee on appropriations with a favorable recommendation second it's second by representative danielson now we can call the law representatives aren't yes danielson yes klingon schmidt no navarro no ransom rosenthal yes sane respectfully no singer yes they're alone yes lebsock yes madam chair yes congratulations that bill's passes seven four it's on its way to appropriations thank you next up we have house bill 1150 representative conte please come forward and tell us about house bill 1150 i mean sort of a goofy bill and it could become just that transparency welcome to local government welcome back to local government thank you madam chair it's nice to be with you today sure thank you madam chair it's a delightful to be with you today madam chair and members of the local government committee it is my pleasure to be with you and to bring before you hospital 1150. this is a measure brought forward by the county governments across colorado it is a very simple bill that simply tweaks existing state statutes regarding restrictions on minors possessing and using tobacco on delivery services back in 2008 the general assembly passed the teen tobacco use prevention act the act empowers local governments to restrict the sale of tobacco products to minors and is a very important legislative tool for protecting our young people the act was amended several years ago to update the definition of tobacco delivery services to include e-cigarettes and vaporizers often called e-cigs and vapes unfortunately when the changes were made they were not cross-referenced in the sections of the statute that contain county regulatory authority to adopt and enforce ordinances regarding possession and use by minors the bill before you today explicitly links those updated definitions to the county regulatory authority and makes it clear that counties can also prohibit the and possession of these e-cigarettes and vapes as well as cities this bill also extends to counties the same level of ordinance-making authority enjoyed by cities and allows not demands allows counties to adopt and enforce penalties and by that i mean fines simply finds we have a few witnesses today who can provide a little bit more background on some of the legal rationale and for these necessary changes thank you madam chair thank you representative conte um so question for you and maybe you or potentially some of the other witnesses will be able to uh address this what are some of the best practices that you're trying to bring to the fore here um allowing you know the counties to adopt legislation that would penalize youth for possession of you know tobacco products and is that somewhere where around the country where this has been effective and we're just going to bring it here to colorado do you have any data on that thank you madam chair uh yes uh representative uh rosenthal there is going to be much data that's going to be presented to you today uh we're simply this this bill was brought forth by the county government cci and in unanimous fashion i can tell you that they but the county that brought it forward has one of the largest metropolises that is unincorporated into city boundaries and that is a small little town that we know is highlands ranch uh and so they are in a situation where they had just an uh an explosion of these kind of in inferences happening on some of their high school campuses uh with the with these kids uh what would happen is the schools would impose their style of penalties and that is detentions suspensions expulsions but obviously you know when they don't show up for detention and they're forced into something harsher the only tool in their toolbox is to kick the kid out of school this is probably counterproductive and so they are coming to the law enforcement saying can you help us out can you do anything and the law enforcement at the county level because they're not incorporated into a city is saying no we really can't we don't have the purview so they are going to their county commissioners saying can you help us out and the county commissioners are then coming to us thank you madam chair um thanks i look forward to seeing some of that data and um and then one final question so do you know of any municipalities in colorado that uh utilize the current statute allowing them to do this and uh and maybe perhaps if they are then you know having some feedback about those and if they are not why are they not adopting this kind of ordinance uh granting themselves power to to penalize these kids thank you madam chair i can tell you honestly uh rep rosenthal that i have not uh had any contact with cml on this to know if there is any kind of city that is enacting this and and again this is not a a mandate this is simply permissive that they can so i really do not know if anyone has chosen to enact any ordinances within city boundaries or not and what the data is there might be some witnesses who know more about that than i do and i do apologize for that representative thank you madam chair representative conti i i certainly share the idea that that children shouldn't be um partaking in in nicotine products i i get that um one thing that um has come to my attention over the last week since reading your bill is that and one was not a surprise and the other one was somewhat surprising but it's it's factual um both there are two organizations at least two that oppose this bill um one being the aclu and i'm not surprised by that because generally speaking the aclu and i share their assessment on ideas on most bills they're they're afraid that we're further criminalizing um behavior of children and that's probably not a good idea because we've already have a robust for lack of a better word a robust school-to-prison pipeline and anything that we're doing that further criminalizes children's behavior is probably not a good thing and so that's not very surprising that the aclu opposes the bill but another thing that i found out um over the last several days is that can i drive the american i need to finish the question first another thing that i found out is that the american cancer society opposes the bill and that's i was a bit surprised and i think that they might have signed up i'm not sure but if you're running a bill for public safety and the american cancer society opposes your bill then um you might have some problems um and so that that's i i just want to know um have you worked with the american cancer society um at all and have you worked with the the aclu in the formation of this bill representative uh thank you madam chair and representative lebsock i can tell you that i have had conversations with both uh representatives from both of those organizations and i can tell you that i will repeat back from my opening comments uh penalties and by that i mean fines not criminalization no one is they don't have any desire to add to the roles of the county jails uh for these types of offenses they're simply looking for something with slightly more teeth than detention and representative who's getting the fine is it the is it the retail or is it the the child this one is permissive to allow the the actual person that's carrying obviously the possession has possession of yes obviously there's already strict laws in place for retailers uh this you know is on the other end and again is uh it being requested by the schools and so do you have a sense of what the fine range is is it the first time you get a fine what happens the second time if you're caught with the product do you know what the progression chain is like madam chair thank you um i can tell you that we do not prescribe that in this bill that is left up to the autonomy of the county commissioners in their and they also do stand election from the people that are in their district that they represent and that is left up to their good judgment to determine the fine yes got it thank you representative um was the singer first oh go ahead and say i'll fight over it okay no thank you madam chair yeah and just for for some clarification i emailed uh jennifer berman the bill drafter about this the criminal penalties because i had a concern about that as well and you know i asked whether or not counties can enact their own criminal statutes they cannot um and um they cannot impose and i'll just read from the the one sentence here they cannot impose their own criminal sanctions they can't put anyone in jail enacting criminal sanctions is not one of the enumerated powers grounded to counties under um 3011-101 so i sort of want to put that issue to bed the i think i'd be interested in hearing not just from the bill sponsor but from those who are testifying who brought the bill to the fore about um what uh how this is an effective public health model one of the things that when i was a drug and alcohol counselor on csu's campus we would do if you know you had a minor in possession of alcohol or another substance oftentimes the first infraction was you know um typically a fine and an education class that you had to attend to learn about how drugs interact with with your body how it affects you socially and the and that was based on research we weren't using the results first model yet but but it was based on on research showing that if you and this is with college students it's a different slightly different population but if you take their time and their money they start paying attention and and so the idea here is if we can do things that get the youth's attention um i'd like to hear what those successful methods have been in cities and how we're extending that to counties today um but that was something that was successful in um at colorado state university so and if the bill sponsor you know has a response for where where it's worked in other cities and how counties intended to um you know repeat that that's great if not um if people testifying would like to to testify to that i've i've queued up the question thank you um for that question did you want to respond representative thank you madam chair and and uh i i can just my response would simply say this bill is simply permissive it allows local county commissioners to go where they want to go so lobby your county commissioner uh and uh and and make sure that you make your best practices known as you understand it to them so that they can take that to heart when they are enacting the ordinances that they would enact within their own county it does not prescribe anything that they have to do it simply is permissive and leaves it to their good judgment representative thank you madam chair and i'm i'm looking in 1813 121 to see it is there a state law is there an existing state law that that prohibits the possession of nicotine representative conti i am calling on a lifeline here and and i am told that it that yes there is and it's probably called tobacco products represent sorry could you repeat that represent left side i'm looking for the the exact statute but i believe there is a state law that um prohibits minors from possessing nicotine and i guess this is my next step is that if we already have a law on the books then why do we why do we need to add this one because the counties can just enforce the current state law i mean i'm just asking that question we have we have a county attorney who will come up and i'm sure shed some light beyond what i am able to do represent art thank you madam chair so uh my professional background is in special education high school teacher uh students with learning disabilities behavior disorders mental handicaps um no amount of detention never stopped a kid from smoking and i'm wondering how giving them a ticket would because what i'm concerned about is kids smoking not punishing them how would this bill help that or hurt that representative madam chair um i would simply again defer to witnesses that we have coming up from the counties who have directly and expressly requested this and i think they can share with you better light on why they're asking for it and how they think that it will help that would help me as well because representative singer was talking about when you find someone it gets their attention and i represent a demographic where the teens and the families may not have money or fine and if it is a team the person that ends up having to pay it might be that parent and i know that you're saying that the counties would determine um how much that fine would be but i do have issues with just the the whole finding in that form of punishment i don't know if that really gets someone's attention that may not be the only issue that they're confronted with they may have summons or tickets for other kinds of things so i do have some concerns about that thank you madam chair i i certainly understand and share your concerns i can tell you that uh one of the things that gave me a little bit more comfort is that it's now the county's asking for this and if you think about it all along the way these officials are going to stand and be accountable to the public both your county commissioners who would set the ordinances and your county sheriffs who are acting and carrying out uh the ordinances that they are given the purview to do and so your sheriff will stand election if there's abuses or there's over over stiff penalties that are burdensome they will stand in account as well as your county commissioners and so i can tell you that that is the check and balance uh that i feel is in this bill as opposed to the previous statute that simply gave cities that have police departments where your chiefs of police are appointed and they do not have to answer to the public so this is a a good check that i feel the county government's offer that was not is not available in current law as it stands for cities okay are we ready for witness testimony we have folks who have signed up for or against do you have a preference take those opposed first okay let's see i'm going to bring up then let's see 444 against it looks like um denise myers is she still here yep please come forward i am thank you very much welcome to local government thank you um madam chair members of the committee my name is denise mayes i'm the public policy director for the aclu of colorado and i am here in opposition to this bill um some of the questions i think that were raised by some of the committee members actually do highlight some of our concerns about the bill but i'll start first with why in the first instance the bill is troubling the aclu has investigated over the years what we call the overuse and frankly the abuse of fines and fees by cities and counties and i think as madam chair raised these fines and fees tend to add up and they're not small and as you heard from the sponsor of the bill representative conte there is no there is no uh ceiling on the amount of fines that counties can create and the fines can simply mount up and i also think that these sorts of fines and fees have a tendency to disproportionately impact uh certain communities and clearly those of limited means um and so um i think that uh we are even though we might feel comfortable with the fact that it's not a per se crime um certainly enough fines and fees can can really burden a particular family and so even at that front i think it's it's problematic definitely on that front the second thing is i'm i'm also baffled by the rationale that was provided for this bill the notion that counties and or schools cannot currently do anything about this particular issue of pervasive nicotine products i i find that to be completely false and maybe i'm missing something and but right now state law makes possession by minors um uh unlawful and and i mean it's uh 1813 121 uh parent to parent little a that basically says that a person who is under 18 years of age and who purchases or attempts to purchase any cigarettes tobacco products or nicotine products commits a class two petty offense and upon conviction shall be finished by a fine of a hundred dollars now interestingly enough there are some guard rails here it says only a hundred dollars there's ways that you can pay off the fine that are not just by pure dollars but you can do a tobacco education program for example so in this instance i think that we have even nicotine products are covered by state law i am aware i am not aware of any law that prohibits a county from enforcing a state law so i don't understand why this isn't sufficient the second thing i'll note is that um possession of tobacco and tobacco products is not permitted in schools and so there's already a vehicle to address this issue whether it be within the classroom itself or on school grounds so what i really see here is the potential to simply pile on you have a state law you have a city law and now you'll have a county law and really you could be fined in all three instances so not only is the fine or fee hundred dollars it's whatever the city now adds and what the county may add and let me give you an example of what douglas county has done and just as just one example they have a an ordinance that prohibits violating a certain curfew well that fine is not only allocated to the individual the teenager who is committing the curfew violation but they also make the parents subject to the fine as well so now you have a double hit in the family for one offense so i think that these sorts of things and this is why i talk about i talk a lot at the aclu about how these particular fines and fees frankly can be abused and i just don't see a very solid rationale to support this bill and that's why i asked for a no vote thank you representative thank you madam chair thank you miss mace so um how does this practically work let's just say um you know under current law current practice you said that uh tobacco products are not allowed in schools and so let's say you know a school you know security officer comes and sees a kid with you know pack of cigarettes says hey can i have those cigarettes um you should not be having those um the kid says no i mean or even says yes i mean what is the enforcement there the kid could just say fine take you know take it out of my my cold dead hands and what is it whether the officer can have a scuffle with a kid i mean i i you know kids are pretty you know strong-headed so what what's the process there of how to work with kids who you know want to hold on to their tobacco miss myers thank you madam chair uh representative rosenthal you know i was such an agreeable kid it's hard for me to really envision that particular scenario but um but you know i went to catholic schools but um anyhow i think it's just like any other transgression that a child commits in school i mean unfortunately some schools don't deal with this very well they deal with it through the criminal justice system which is obviously unfortunate but i think that there's a better way to deal with it within the school dynamic itself whether it's um let's call your parents in let's talk about what's going on let's i mean i think you can ratchet up whether it comes to you know half a day of of sitting in a suspension hall reading on all the ills of tobacco i mean there are lots of ways that schools can wrestle all kinds of problems that happen on an everyday basis that don't involve a punitive approach um like i think will likely occur uh through this through this particular bill represent singer did you still have a question yeah uh thank you madam chair um i have a couple questions but i'm just going to limit it to one right now i think um in terms of the concern about this issue specifically are you aware of cities that have put in onerous um fines or penalty structures for minors that you know really hasn't lent itself to a better public health outcome miss myers thank you madam chair i'm not entirely certain that i understand your question representative singer um because i think i heard two double negatives but um but i what i i've been in the legislature i've been in the legislature for a while now that's my fault yeah i don't know about not not having to no i'm just kidding um i i honestly am not aware of a lot of municipalities that have these particular laws that aren't both city and county for example in denver um and and then secondly i think that um that the jury so to speak would still be out on whether or not there's an educational benefit to it i think what the state does uh as i mentioned um earlier in my testimony that that there's ways even to work off the hundred dollar fine in the state law where you can actually go to a tobacco education class which seems uh hopefully to get the job done better than having a particular punitive approach further questions seeing none thank you for your testimony today um thank you thank you representative conte has a bill in another committee that's why she's not at the table but she has requested that we proceed with the uh testimony so i'm gonna call up the next uh witness here and it looks like this rj and can't read the writing owens ours owls please come forward ours okay o-u-r-s thank you madam chair good afternoon madam chair and members of the committee my name is rj hours and i'm the colorado director of government relations with the american cancer society cancer action network which we call acs can for short here in denver i'm here today representing acs can and on behalf of fellow members of the colorado tobacco-free alliance including the american heart association the american lung association the campaign for tobacco-free kids and the colorado group to alleviate smoking pollution i want to thank representative conte as well as colorado counties and the sheriffs for their concern about youth and the use of cigarettes and other tobacco products including e-cigarettes acs can and the heart association the lung association ctfk and colorado gasp are very concerned about the increase in the marketing sales and use of e-cigarettes in colorado however our alliance partners do not support house bill 1150 as introduced we actually oppose the passage of the measures in 2008 that had been referred to earlier uh criminalizing youth possession of cigarettes and tobacco products so we we believe we need to be consistent here and and not support the extension of something we previously opposed uh so we we don't support that expansion uh of of the language from that time we believe the culpability and penalties related to youth tobacco use should be focused on those who sell or provide tobacco products to underage youth and not the young people who have been enticed to try or buy tobacco products additionally we do not support the use of the term nicotine products in legislation to denote the products of concern by defining them separately and then in a more seemingly innocuous way we believe it diminishes the importance of regulating all tobacco and tobacco derived products and they're and there are non-nicotine smokeless products and non-nicotine electronic smoking devices on the market now that may not be included by the language in this legislation since the introduction of e-cigarettes to the u s market around eight years ago the marketing and use of these products have increased markedly specifically regarding youth a study from the centers for disease control and prevention found that e-cigarettes were the most used tobacco product among youth in 2014 increasing from 1.5 percent to 13.4 percent of high school students reporting current use between 2011 and 2014 with similar trends in middle school students a growing number of studies have examined the contents of e-cigarette aerosol unlike a vapor an aerosol contains fine particles of liquid solid or both propylene glycol nicotine and flavorings were most commonly found in e-cigarettes aerosols other studies have found the aerosol to contain heavy metals volatile organic compounds and tobacco-specific nitrosamines among the potentially harmful chemicals and a 2009 study done by the fda found cancer-causing substances in several e-cigarette samples tested and additionally the food and drug administration tests found nicotine in some e-cigarettes that claim to contain no nicotine the health effects of e-cigarettes are currently under study and there are still serious questions about the safety of inhaling the substances in e-cigarette aerosol while e-cigarette manufacturers may claim the ingredients are just water vapor or safe without federal regulation and analysis there's no sure way for e-cigarette users to know what they are consuming nor is there any way of knowing what non-users are exposed to and the extent of the health risk to them additionally there are hundreds of other types of e-cigarettes on the market today and products vary considerably by ingredients and quality control assurance on behalf of acs can and our tobacco control alliance i want to sincerely thank again representative conte for her concern about the use of cigarettes and tobacco products by young people here in colorado we deeply appreciate her bringing this important issue to the table thank you all for your discussion here today and for this opportunity to speak thank you madam chair and i'm happy to take any questions thank you mr hours representative singer thank you madam chair and thank you mr alex for being here and also representing a coalition of people as opposed to having each of those members come up and testified so you saved me the time for asking this question six times uh what i'm curious about is so if you said that the the use of of e-cigarettes is is jumping even though it looks like overall tobacco uses is you know still down um but it sounds like almost a ten-fold increase in e-cigarette use by miners which is you know i think everyone here is worried about that ah to a certain extent whatever public health or legal framework that we've put in place today isn't doing its job if that's where the jump is now it could be any number of things that that we haven't gone and mounted a good enough public information campaign um from e-cigarettes or from from uh uh you know old tobacco products to to e-cigarettes um but i guess my question is if this isn't the answer and the status quo isn't the answer what what should cities and counties in the state be doing to work directly with youth with the you know individuals that are that are making these decisions independent of their parents independent of of the school system obviously independent of me mr hours thank you madam chair representative singer uh we believe strongly and i i sort of alluded to it my comments but there's so much more that can be done to adequately enforce the legal sale of all tobacco products including e-cigarettes we have no state license licensing system in colorado we have very little in the way of penalties i do believe that that the authorities do enforce and inspect and and uh to the best their abilities but but to to our minds there just aren't yet the resources adequately in place to enable especially local enforcement of tobacco retail sales and that's something we advocated here for last year to enable because we believe in local control for public health and that's something we advocated very hard for last year to allow these same local communities we're talking about today cities municipalities and counties to pass their own ordinances levy their own sanctions uh to to those tobacco uh sellers when they transgress all right president singer thanks no i'll leave it at that right now representative thank you um madam chair so mr hours you know sort of relay across the country what are some of the programs of um you know where you do have instances of municipalities adopting uh these kinds of you know punitive measures and you know what's been the result of some of those do you have any of that information or data mr owls thank you madam chair uh representative rosenthal i i do not have national information as it relates to current state law enabling local communities cities and municipalities to have their own ordinances in place that can reflect or go further than the state law only woodland park i am told has in the last eight years availed themselves to that opportunity and to what uh degree to what um result i i'm not aware we we were not asked to be uh engaged in that effort at the time uh which we wouldn't have supported but we were not contacted mr alex can you speak then to um maybe what the awareness efforts are taking place to um prevent these products from getting in the kids hands because i know that we're talking about finding which is punitive but i'm more interested in not that aspect but i'd like to hear more about one of the intervention strategies that we're using to address the healthcare aspects as it relates to nicotine products thank you madam chair specifically i don't have a lot of detail but generally i know that there are parts of the health department's tobacco control efforts that are aimed at prevention and youth education we're lucky here in colorado to have the benefit of of resources from the amendment 35 tobacco taxes each year that go into these educational programs we have monies available for our our great colorado quit line program to help adults especially quit smoking so there are resources available we're not at the threshold yet that the cdc prescribes uh for funding of tobacco control programs so there probably is more we could do if we had the resources but i i believe we are making the best use of what we have right now thank you representative lebson thank you madam chair um thank you mr hours for your testimony you made it clear um in your prepared remarks that the american cancer society is opposed to this bill but you also mentioned that the tobacco control alliance and i didn't grab my pin fast enough can you tell us those organizations that are also opposed that you're representing today please thank you madam chair representative it includes in addition to the american cancer society cancer action network the american heart association the american lung association the campaign for tobacco-free kids and the colorado group to alleviate smoking pollution gasp colorado gasp and we've been partners for over 50 years in tobacco control here in colorado thank you thank you who's missing from the group it seems like it's pretty honest thank you madam chair and with the chair's permission uh mr hours is it that you oppose the state giving the freedom to the counties or you would actually oppose the counties themselves choosing to act upon that freedom miss ours thank you madam chair representative conte as i stated earlier in my remarks and i believe he had to step out we our our coalition was opposed to the 2008 bill that amended statute to criminalize the possession youth possession of tobacco products as defined currently we also see extending that uh coverage beyond just the state and municipalities to counties is also uh something that that we have to oppose we you know we want to be consistent and it's important and if i may it it's important to understand when when our organizations look to methods to try to remedy this situation we look to science and evidence basis uh uh types of opportunities and and among those are are the ones i mentioned earlier about tighter regulation of the sale of tobacco products education penalizing criminalizing youth possession by kids is not one of the cdc recommended best practices to to achieve that thank you so much for your testimony today thank you so i have two more witnesses um chris is it pratt yes and then uh eric bergman do you guys want to come together introduce yourself one at a time and and share your remarks thank you madam chair my name is chris pratt i'm an assistant county attorney with douglas county here representing their interests in this bill i think we've the committee has already heard a good deal of testimony on the expansion of the use of e-cigarettes and how technology has really outpaced somewhat the law in in trying to prevent miners from getting access to these types of products um there is currently there was it the question was raised there is currently on the law 2514 301 which makes the possession of a tobacco product by a minor illegal that also allows municipalities home rule or statutory to enact stricter prohibitions conspicuously missing from that is counties and that may be because many counties don't have large unincorporated populations that they deal with but as has been mentioned in douglas county we have almost an entire city that we deal with and we have been approached in douglas county our sheriff's office has been approached by the school district who has schools both in municipalities and in unincorporated douglas county and they have been approached asking what our sheriff's deputies can do to help them enforce this prohibition against miners having tobacco products to which the answer has been we don't think we can do anything the law doesn't give us as a statutory county authority to go beyond what is written there which is more or less to tell them that's illegal you shouldn't be doing that and so what this bill proposes is to allow counties the same tools that municipalities have for the constituents and the leaders of those counties to have that tool should they need it to help the schools in in the case of douglas county or to help the county itself deal with what is a growing problem among minors in the county um now there's been a lot of testimony about the possibility of what this could grow into but i think as representative condi pointed out there are a lot of checks and balances that would prevent the abuse of this authority one the local governments are answerable to their constituents if their constituents don't want fines then they won't elect local leaders who are going to impose fines for this however every community being unique they all need the discretion to deal with this as the community dictates and in some communities it may be necessary to impose fines i do not have any information on exactly which municipalities have chosen to to enact an ordinance imposing a fine or what effect that may have and so i apologize i won't be able to enlighten you any on that however i can tell you that it seems peculiar that municipalities are granted that authority but counties are not there does not seem to be any particular reason for that loophole and in douglas county this is a particular problem because we have a very large population incorporated county we have i i want to say at least three high schools in unincorporated parts of the county and we we feel basically powerless to help the school despite their pleas for assistance to do anything because without this legislation we do not think that we have the authority to assist the schools in any way other than to send a deputy to tell those teenagers you shouldn't be doing that that's illegal and i think we all know what a teenager is going to do when you tell them that so all we're really asking for here is to put the counties on par with municipalities we're not asking to impose fines although the local officials and their constituents may see fit to do so we're just asking for this loophole to be eliminated for the counties to put on the sp be put on the same legal authority as the municipalities within their journey with the counties and for those for the discretion that's given to municipalities be given also to the county thank you miss brett quick question because i thought i heard um in statute that there is already code that could be used for your sheriffs to address possession of a minor with uh tobacco products when i say you can't do it i'm just having a hard time understanding why a sheriff can't exercise the law in douglas county thank you madam chairman the i believe you're talking about the aclu that testified that there is a law that imposes a fine under the criminal code title 18. but that's for selling that's for selling tobacco products to a minor representative farlow you have the statute there can you help us i thank you madam chairman i doubt that i can help you but i can i can raise the question we have the draft i can raise the question again maybe it's maybe it's for the drafter but yes it seems confusing to me between sure a good buck it's 25 14 301 and in 1813 121 and i don't think we're seeing where it excludes counties thank you matt thank you madam chair jennifer berman with the office of legislative legal services in the criminal code section 1813-121 it does provide that let me just check well a person who is under 18 years of age and who purchases or attempts to purchase any cigarette tobacco products or nicotine products commits a class to petty offense they can be punished by a fine of 100 but i believe that they could do community service to work that off as well the statute goes on to mention again that's purchase or attempt to purchase which is potentially different from possession oh i'm raising my money if i make something i'm in church here okay so but i i thought you know cause i you know we have 7-elevens all up and down colfax and i know that if you have possession if you're a minor and you have possession of tobacco product that's illegal so it has to be somewhere isn't it somewhere in the statue for a minor to have possession of tobacco that is you're trying to say it's not you're saying it's legal no man okay mr pratt madam chair thank you no a separate statute 25 14 301 makes possession of tobacco products by miners illegal however it does not impose any penalty and at the very end in subsection four you'll note that nothing in the section shall be construed to prohibit any statutory or homeroom municipality from enacting an ordinance that prohibits possession of cigarettes tobacco products by a person who's under 18 years of age or imposes requirements that are more stringent than that provided in this section however as i said conspicuously missing from that is counties who have no authority that is not granted to them by the state expressly members i did find that in statute representative rosenthal uh thank you madam chair and um i have a couple observations which you may or may or may not want to respond to and they're going to come across as snarky so just forewarned uh on the one hand you know no municipality is taking advantage of this and of this except for as was mentioned woodland park and isn't there a message there that they obviously don't think that this is necessary that it's effective and then or maybe you should answer that one first or speak to it if you wish mr pratt um as i said and i and i believe um as was testified it's it's unclear how many are taking advantage so there was one example that was known and i do not have further information to enlighten you on who may be using those all i can tell you is that as i understand it our school district in douglas county has approached us and asked us what we can do in this regard did you have a follow-up yes and and the other one is and i suppose that's it's not gonna happen but you know highlands ranch could always incorporate and then they'll have this right so i think i have a good solution for you no comment right no comment representative aren't i suppose i'm still unclear on the goal are they trying to help kids stop smoking or punish them and those are two different things in my mind representative conte bill sponsor madam chair i would surmise as maybe i have slightly more confidence in the douglas county commissioners that certainly if i were sitting in the role that there might be a fee but that it might be connected with a community service to be able to work it off or a educational class that would be designed to stop kids long enough to give them a message of what this that we're opposing a small fine right now this is pennies compared to what this habit could cost you did you say you're already imposing a fine is that no i'm not no i'm i'm saying that if i have faith that the douglas county commissioners who are the people that are primarily asking for this bill would have that common sense that no simply imposing a fine is not going to do the job and i would suspect that that would not be their intentions and that given the opportunity they would exercise the same wisdom and judgment that exists within this body well i'm wondering why then the douglas county is the sheriff's police department they're saying that they just feel hopeless that they're just rendering they just don't know what to do with these kids and they have no tools there's nothing they can do madam chair just just so you understand there is no police department because it's not a city it's the sheriff so it is the county sheriff's that is the law enforcement mechanism i just want to make sure that we're we've grasping the sheriffs are saying that absolutely nothing they can do with the the kids that are having nicotine products in douglas county is absolutely nothing they can do oh madam madam chair so the way the law reads right now it's illegal and so if the school is having difficulty enforcing through their own prohibitions which we've already discussed can lead to a slippery slope of just ejecting the student from school which is not desirable they ask the sheriff's office often who provide deputies to the schools to have a deputy tell these students it would be helpful is my understanding if the deputy could issue a ticket because right now the sheriff's office understanding of the law and our understanding is that that is all all they can do at this point is to tell them that's illegal you need to stop because you're saying they cannot issue them a ticket right now i'm saying that 25 14 301 does not give the county the authority to do anything um so i'm glad i'm glad you referenced that that section of statute i'll read it again it's 25 14 301 and it specifically states i'm not an attorney but it's fairly clear and this is a state law possession of a cigarette or tobacco product by a person who is under 18 years of age is prohibited and so this is similar to where we have other state laws that the county can enforce and frankly that cities can enforce in this case let's just talk about county since we're talking about counties there are domestic violence statutes and it's against state law to do certain things and your sheriff can uphold the state law in regards to domestic violence charges so why wouldn't they be able to to look at this statute and and say yes there's something on the books that prevents the possession of a cigarette or tobacco products by a person who is under 18 years of age mr pratt well and that is the problem we're running into is they they can't go to that we'll say teenager we'll say a 16 year old teenager the officer could approach that 16 year old and say that's illegal you have to stop that's all he can do he has no authority within the county's jurisdiction to do any more than tell him that madame thank you madam chair representative lebsock can you show me the penalty well representative um i i guess i don't mind answering a question from the the bill sponsor madam chair i guess i will do that so the question isn't um whether or not there's a penalty the question is is it appropriate for you to criminalize a child's behavior in your bill we just heard from the american cancer society and the whole group of tobacco control alliance folks who are opposed to the bill and they are saying that penalizing kids with a fine is not part of their agenda and they're saying it's not going to help and so that that's what i'm basing my decision on is what's in your bill um also if i'd have been here in 2008 i'd have been voted no on the other one as well um but that's neither here nor there further questions for mr pratt representative singer thank you madam chair i think there was a question in there first i want to give one of the people who's sitting at the table the opportunity to respond and then i'll queue up my question if that's appropriate representative thank you madam chair i'd just like to remind you representative lebsock this is not criminalizing as we've heard from representative lebsock in his conversation with the drafter this is a civil penalty it is not a criminal that what they're asking to do their authority does not extend that way and so this is simply a civil matter it is not in any way going to put anyone on anything on anybody's record so to speak i just want to make that clear so representative singer thank you thank you manager actually i'd like to respond to representatives i have i have a follow-up thank you madam chair you just said it's not going to be put on anybody's record and so if the county um initiates a penalty and fines then that child when they are they have that fine associated with that behavior is not going to be on their their their record representative conte uh madam chair thank you so much that is my understanding singer thank you representative lebsock i think one of the things that and this is how state and city and county sort of operate if you already finished your drink so i won't mention north clint but but uh but but how how states so the interaction of state and county and this has come up in taxation issues in the past unless the state specifically enumerates the ability of a county to do something it it is legally questionable as to whether that county is able to to take its own action and that's i mean we can disagree with the the content of the bill or why we're bringing this or the or even the you know the intentions behind it but i think it's just just to get that off off the table here that's part of the challenge when we tell cities something it's very different than when we don't enumerate something um in statute as it relates to to counties that being said so i i've i guess three questions here and two of them are yes no questions and one of them's a little bit longer so so is the douglas county school board in in support of this bill it's the douglas county sheriff's office in support of this bill and the third thing is what is douglas county's plan assuming this bill were to pass and and and you know is the and thank you for taking notes uh because i'm continuing to ask questions here um and so is the plan just fines is it fines in education is it um using a um a standard program that has been shown to stop um underage tobacco use because the the you know the reason i signed on to this bill is is the sort of if it's good for the goose it's good for the gander thought on on cities and counties but i would hope that the commissioners and i know commissioner hilbert very well well when he was commissioner i mean i know that he put inconsiderable amount of thought into this and so i'd like to know what the county's plan is mr pratt thank you i appreciate the opportunity and for the first two questions yes and yes um the school board and the sheriff's office in douglas county are in support of this bill in fact our former sheriff is now a county commissioner he was the one who brought this to cci's attention and cci from my understanding unanimously supported this um and so this is not merely a douglas county issue i think all the counties recognize that it it's it's a legislative oddity that the counties were left out of this um perhaps an oversight but as far as a plan i can't comment on a plan at this point i don't think anyone has made a plan because at this point the answer is we can't do that we're not going to make plans about something we can't do but i'm anticipating if it's that many young people who are smoking and the sheriffs are not able to do anything about it and they they can collect some revenue there's probably some thought about uh projected revenue that they can capture from ticketing and fining they probably think that we could probably get maybe a hundred thousand dollars if there is i am not privy to any of those plans um slightly different question so so schools are tobacco-free campuses right as it is now so i mean i would really like to have you know someone from the school district as opposed you know sorry that you're here for this question but but um part of the reason i asked if there was a plan is there's a lot of steps that go um in front of suspension or expulsion or any number of things and so i would hope that the douglas county schools can comment on this or that you can comment on on their behalf in some way about what it is about a tobacco-free campus that is not working for them and whether or not what's happening right now in douglas county schools isn't happening in other schools such as denver or other places where you're more able to to respond to these issues because those powers don't have to be enumerated mr pratt thank you and i am not sure it was a long question so i'm trying to place my thoughts i'll make shorter statements next time douglas county as i as my understanding is was approached by the school board and that's what initiated this whole effort from douglas county is that the school board was having difficulty with their system it was not working as and i think we've heard some testimony as this e-cigarette situation has grown i almost exploded really what we're finding is it's very difficult for the school to police this on their own students can very easily hide them they're not lit they can put in their pocket they can disguise them as other things and so the schools when they do find them are having difficulty because they can't really if they can't really stop people from using them and it's easy for them to hide them the times they do find them there really is no there's no way to stop the behavior to to to present the students with a situation where there's they don't want to be caught and the hope i think my understanding is they had hoped that perhaps if the sheriff's deputies who help out at the schools could issue a citation that that would have a significant effect on students willingness to bring those kinds of things to school that's my understanding representative singer thank you madam chair okay so there is a plan the idea is as a financial citation one of the things that i cited and when i what i worked on you know when i was doing similar programs not with tobacco but with alcohol is time and money and you know a citation is money but i would hope that the school district actually educates their kids about these things you catch someone with with a tobacco product you say you know what you're you're spending an extra six hours in health class young man um you know what whatever it is um that you know my my first um you know i'm not angling for kids wallets as their as the first line of defense here and so that's that's why i'm trying to hear you know the school's out of ideas but all i'm hearing is punishment punishment punishment but where's the education and i understand you're not there but i'm guessing you can talk to them i'm sitting down with the douglas county human services manager next week actually about all sorts of issues because i'm i'm really committed to giving the counties the authority but if they can't explain what they're going to do with the authority why would i want to grant that authority other than the parity issue mr bergman looks like you're ready to speak thank you so much madam chair and good afternoon everybody uh i wanted to kind of uh just kind of piggyback on representative singer's question and and statement uh i'm eric bergman with colorado counties incorporated um first off i want to say a couple introductory remarks we are currently 12th in the nation in teen smoking colorado is 12th which is shocking to me given our healthy lifestyle here um we're right behind arkansas and west virginia and unless you're talking about you know per capita gravy consumption i don't know that i ever want to be associated uh with with states like that um i've had a handout today that had some articles from around the state on um the explosion of teen tobacco use especially e-cigarettes and ones from craig one's from durango and one's from loveland all kind of bemoaning the fact that we are seeing these the spike in use right now what we are doing and uh in education and i apologize because we had a health and prevention health and prevention specialist from douglas county schools scheduled to come today and she had to cancel last night on us and so i talked to her on the phone for a bit they are doing education they're doing i think everything they think they can possibly do and it's just not enough um we are what this bill is trying to do is just trying to give us one more tool you know we talk about states being the laboratories of democracy and i kind of feel like local governments are the laboratories of democracy within the state we're trying something here desperately these e-cigarettes are have become a blight uh they're also used to smoke marijuana that's the other problem they're having is it's not just nicotine products that are being smoked in these things and they are so prevalent now it's out of control um i think also it's important to remember and i think you might have alluded this in your opening remarks representative singer even the threat of a ticket may work as a disincentive um you know the fines themselves uh the even the threat of a fine may provide that disincentive to get involved with this but the way we're going now i see us going down the wrong road and we're trying something here that we feel like might have a chance and we want to see if it can work and i do feel it'll be in conjunction with more education and other preventative strategies no one wants to just start taking money away from kids but i think what we're doing right now is not working and so we're asking for some parity with the cities to try to do something more in one in a couple communities that are urban size that are like giant cities um to try and get these kids back on track and that's all we're trying to do here and i happy thank you thank you madam chair i just had questions about that do you have any data at all that um finding someone for smoking has ever been a deterrent mr bergman i do not does it i just wonder thank you madam chair um i just wonder if the posers in the room do um that's one question the other question is when you said um with all due respect that it's it's not working i i i'm i'm glad you got to finally to the piece that where there is some prevention or concern about that but it seems to me there's a request to have an additional layer of punitive uh action on on students to criminalize it further uh with a monetary fine if if the concern is really to get kids to stop smoking it would seem like it within the bill there might be something that says and all money from these fines will circle back to prevention i mean i just i i can't get over hearing what echoing what representative singer said i'm just hearing additional punishment works and i don't you don't have any data to support that and neither do i i mean i don't have any counter factuals so to be fair um and if anyone has any i'd be willing to listen thank you further questions representative clinton smith thank you madam chair and thank you for your testimony i know this bill pertains to adding counties and adding nicotine products but are there similar authorities in place for counties to penalize teens who use marijuana and do you already have authority in that area and if i pass this would it be similar to giving you a tool that you already use in marijuana enforcement which i think is unconstitutional even for teenagers it's illegal for uh kids under 18 to have possession of uh marijuana products 21 yeah under 21 it's just 21. under 21 is illegal but you can madam chair thank you um uh representative klingenschmidt it is my understanding that any device that could deliver a vaping of marijuana products would also be capable of delivering tobacco products therefore it this applies it's the same mechanism same function in the pen it's just substituting one for another so any pen that could deliver a vaped marijuana could also deliver the vaped nicotine so this bill would cover should cover the pen's use for marijuana as well represent clinton smith thank you madam chair i think you answered my question but i just want to rephrase it maybe you can tell me if i understand it properly that if this bill passes it would regulate paraphernalia or give counties the power to regulate paraphernalia which is probably being sold over the counter retail for vaping but the teens are not using it for vaping they may be using it for marijuana and you're not able to enforce that use of that paraphernalia or you're not able to confiscate that because the counties don't have power to confiscate it because they think it's a vaping product but really the teens are using it for other substances so if this bill passes it would help you prevent illegal marijuana usage using these vaping paraphernalia am i understanding that correctly mr pratt i believe you are understanding that correctly representative klingenschmidt part of the bill you'll note is to change the definition used for tobacco products from a taxation definition to the definitions used in the criminal law and that definition says any device that can be used to deliver nicotine or tobacco to the person inhaling from the device including an electronic cigarette cigar cigarette or pipe and under that definition regardless of what they're really using it for if it can be used to deliver nicotine it would fall under the purview of the counties if this passed thank you madam chair i'm sorry maybe i didn't maybe i was too long and drawn out but i thought i had a question in there if this bill is about helping kids not smoke why does it not say that any fine levies will be used for education representative conte madam chair i just like to say i don't know that we would be opposed to that um that is you know as i'm talking with my counterparts here representing the counties they don't have any doubt that that would be exactly what they would use the dollars for they're not looking to for a new source for to pave their roads yeah so this this i i think that their heart is to get kids off of this they're trying to do anything and everything that they can to deliver this message education absolutely you know and punitive measures to deliver the the thought i can tell you that you know when it hits your pocketbook it does hurt well you know if you are buying tobacco products that's already hitting your pocketbook okay so there's already you know you're already spending your money on that adam chair yes thank you madam chair i have actually talked with uh tobacco-free kids on this topic and it's not uncommon for parents especially in the region that we're talking about to load a debit card with enough money for lunch for that child for every day of the week and they're expecting that that kid is paying for lunch every day what they're in fact doing is taking that debit card elsewhere and using it for an illegal purchase well you're saying that you're now saying that teens are going into 7-elevens with the debit cards of their moms get them to buy tobacco which is illegal madam chair 7-11 should be or wherever should be checking ids before they make that kind of purchase madam chair yes yes i have actually talked with tobacco-free kids and they have told me of an instance where the retailer inflated the price of the cigarettes knowing the child was illegal and and calculated that it would be enough if that kid bought cigarettes every week that would be enough to pay the fine that they would be levied if they were caught i think we're off topic on this one uh representative rosenthal thank you madam chair so um i don't know who would be best to answer the question but so just walk me through briefly what would happen if um a child is fined um and so how do they pay that fine do they uh do they just mail it in do they go on the internet and pay that way do they have to go to court um and then also what if they don't pay the fine is the fine increased is they they have to go to a court is court factored in anywhere in this mr pratt i believe if it's a civil fine i believe court would not factor into this and the exact handling of how it would be paid and what would happen if it was not paid is something that the local government can establish on a case-by-case basis they could in the ordinance they can decide how they want to handle that that's again part of the toolbox that they would be given for handling a local problem yeah most fines when they're not paid it issues a warrant for your arrest by civil fine you can't just have if the law enforcement issues you uh a summons or a ticket and has a fine if you don't there is consequences and typically it is a warrant but i'm not quite sure in this situation here but that is like common practice representative rosenthal you're laughing you laughing about i just i i don't know i'm just thinking like if if you if if somebody doesn't pay a parking fine you can you know they can put a boot on the car but i don't know how you put a boot on a kid i mean that grounding is grounding okay it's been a long afternoon who else has a question okay seeing none thank you for your testimony today i appreciate it okay let's see there's one more witness i have to call up mr kaplan please come forward introduce yourself and who you represent we will not be putting boots on kids welcome thank you good afternoon madam chairwoman representative fields and members of the committee my name is gabriel kaplan i am the branch chief of the health promotion and chronic disease prevention branch in the prevention services division in the colorado department of public health and environment i'm here today on behalf of dr larry wolck the department's executive director and the colorado's chief medical officer to share information from the department regarding the matters covered in hb 16 1150 clarifying the counties may prohibit underage nicotine procession tobacco use has been classified by the cdc and others in the nation as a pediatric epidemic research projects that 5.6 million youth who are currently using tobacco today are projected to die prematurely as a result of their initiation of tobacco use and preventing young people from ever picking up a cigarette or a nicotine product is a major priority of our program this bill extends to counties in ability already afforded to statutory municipalities which would allow counties to purchase to pass purchase and or underage possession or what are called pup ordinances or resolutions and we welcome this concern we agree that youth initiation of tobacco use is a severe problem and progress on reducing youth initiation tobacco products as representative singer has pointed out has slowed in fact the proportion of youth who we identified through surveillance instruments as susceptible to initiating smoking has increased since 2008 from 19 to 35 in 2013 and another survey we conducted indicated that about 60 percent of students in grades 6 through 12 thought it would be pretty easy or very easy for them to get cigarettes or nicotine products if they wanted them these data indicate that the popularity of these e-cigarettes or vape pens is rising pretty rapidly and further studies that we've looked over in the department have indicated that vapors are six times more likely to begin smoking than non-vapors and they have 40 times the odds of becoming daily cigarette smokers than non-vapors what we understand about youth usage of tobacco products is that they are the targets of clever and shrewd campaigns that are meant to entice them to purchase and use these products even though tobacco and nicotine sellers know it is illegal to sell these products to them many of these products come in flavors that really are meant to appeal to children only bubble gum fruit flavor fruit blast these are flavors that are meant to appeal to younger and younger audiences the department of public health and environment supports allowing counties and municipalities to have the powers they need to control youth access to tobacco and we have an extended history of working with our local public health agency partners to offer many programs and services to control smoking these statutes or pup laws are intended to reduce youth smoking by making kids more personally responsible for buying and using tobacco products evidence reviewed by the program however has shown that tobacco control efforts which penalize children who are often exposed to aggressive marketing tactics or illegal sales on the retail environment have not been proven to be an effective strategy for use reducing youth smoking however counties and municipal governments can pursue multiple evidence-based interventions promoted by our state tobacco control program to address illegal sales of tobacco products including nicotine products the department uses amendment 35 monies to fund the rocky mountain center for youth prevention and local public health departments to provide assistance to school districts to implement the tobacco-free schools law and to address the problem of youth possession and other nicotine products in a way that focuses on prevention and education our state tobacco program has worked with the rocky mountain center to develop and implement a program we call second chance which is a school-based alternative to suspension or penalty programs for kids who violate tobacco-free schools and or minor possession laws and we also fund the american lung association's non-tobacco cessation program to help kids who are trying to quit using tobacco mechanisms to reduce colorado's youth epidemic need to be comprehensive in order to focus on the source of the problem and the source of the problem is essentially the enticement and supply of tobacco products to children who lack the skills and independence to make good choices that can serve them throughout their life policies should include merchant and community education retailer licensing banning the sale of candy flavored products prohibiting the redemption of coupons conducting regular store inspections and supporting strong penalties for vendors who sell to minors for adults who sell to minors these strategies when applied together have been shown to reduce illegal sales we thank you for sharing this information with you and i'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have thank you thank you mr kaplan questions representative art thank you madam chair i just want to thank you for the information that's what i was looking for questions i just have a question because you mentioned that the source of the problem may not be um punishing or summoning or ticketing um the youth that the source of the problem is how we advertise and promote the product is that what i heard you saying that is correct madam chairman we uh really try to focus on that as the central source of the problem is the sales focus and what kinds of resources or support can you provide douglas county because we've heard from the school district that they support this bill we've heard from the sheriff's department that they support this bill i guess the commissioners support this bill what kinds of resources or information can you share with them about other effective models that might work for douglas county that's not a summons or a fine or ticket well madam chairman thank you we would be happy to put them in touch with the rocky mountain center and with the local public health department tri-county uh which is aware of the second chance program which is a program that we implement um that is focused on this problem it actually has a very interesting approach which i think addresses some of the questions that have been raised by the committee so we generally advocate in this program that counties and school districts and those who work with youth always confiscate the tobacco products that that should be an important part of the discipline approach and that parents and guardians should be notified as quickly as possible of a tobacco violation and this should be signed and returned to school for repeated violations that we consider and we suggest additional strategies which include parent guardian notification via telephone call by a school official conferences with parents guardians school leadership and others mandatory enrollment in the second chance program referral to school counselors and nurses for assessment including tobacco prevention education enrollment and cessation classes if the youth are interested in that written assignments around the health effects of tobacco guided questions regarding the reasons for their personal use and motivations for quitting restorative justice and community justice programs in school suspensions including tobacco prevention education programs as part of that suspension and then suspension from her extracurricular activities for a limited time thanks for sharing that information representative and it's real quick i don't want to belabor the the point but i think that was a good question that you had and i want to thank mr kaplan for identifying the programs and things that cdphe believes work one sentence in your presentation stated that penalizing children have not been proven to reduce nicotine or tobacco use in children i believe that could you repeat what you said there and that you're in your prepared statements because i want to make sure because that it speaks directly to what representative arndt was asking of other witnesses i just want to make sure i get that quote correct and from your prepared statements i think it started with penalizing children have not been proven yeah i'm sorry mr kaplan please thank you man and chairwoman members of committee and representative lebsock uh so by sentence read evidence reviewed by the program has shown that tobacco control efforts which penalize children who are often exposed to aggressive marketing and tactics or illegal sales in the retail environment have not been proven to be an effective strategy for reducing youth smoking there's a document that's put out by the cdc uh called the comprehensive community guide to preventive services which goes over public health interventions and they've looked at strategies that simply penalize youth possession and found them to not be effective by themselves and instead advocate comprehensive programs that look at a wide variety of tools thank you representative singer thank you madam chair just uh as as a repetition there can you repeat the comprehensive miss the rest of that title sure um so comprehensive uh tobacco uh prevention programs for youth initiation which include banning the flavorings of products that appeal to youth it includes a licensure of tobacco retailers it includes regular inspections and severe penalties to vendors who violate the sales rules to minors it addresses the sort of organization of tobacco product sales within the store location to make them less accessible to youth behind the counters behind opaque glass those sorts of things in addition to the kinds of strategies that have been discussed here thank you representative thank you madam chair i've just been listening to my folks from colorado counties and who have been in contact with those folks out in the field who are dealing with this their thought was exactly where your minds are that the education might be so much more the important piece and literally their fines their tickets might be as little as five dollars but along with that comes mandatory time that they have to spend in education classes and so forth it's not it's it's just a mechanism that along with one can come the other and they can group that all together and i am every confidence that the county commissioners in any county that wanted to enact any kind of ordinance would be connecting with our partners here at the state level who have the documentation and would be taking the heed and the advice from them just as we would at the state level thank you further questions for mr kaplan seeing none then at this point is there anyone else that would like to testify on 11.50 please come forward ma'am chair i so apologize pat ratliff for colorado counties i've got a meeting going there and this hearing here and this is more important um we've been reacting both representative conte and cci to what we viewed as a fairly narrow request it's clear to me that there is much more here that needs to be considered we've talked with a number of legislators but certainly not all of you we would like the opportunity to make this a rationally helpful intervention with youth and i in particular have reasons for wanting this did i introduce myself pat rat of colorado counties i've lost half my family to smoking i'm so crazed about this i can't begin to speak of it i would like everyone to know that we will work with the various sponsors to make this a bill that does not concern you about profiling or costs or anything else that views a comprehensive approach to these children that is what we intend and that's what we will commit to do with our very sponsors on second reading we would just ask you to let us have the opportunity to do what we should have done ahead of time i so apologize but i appreciate your attention thank you madam chair any thank you for your testimony today any questions seeing none thank you anyone else that would like to testify on house bill 1150 please come forward welcome to local government please introduce yourself good afternoon panel local government my name's sophia san miguel and i just have a first-hand experience with uh i represent myself um a young lady who is into those vape pens and unfortunately i didn't realize that they've transitioned into nicotine provision in the vape pen prior to just recently they had made them where they were just fumes of some vapor that didn't possess nicotine however currently now they're coming out with .6 nicotine vape pens and i no i don't smoke i don't have anything to do with nicotine it's um an alternative for some of them given the fact that full-blown cigarettes are pretty deadly at times so i support the bill if it helps young folks get off cigarettes or never even touch them well thank you for your testimony today is there any yes we'll have to make sure that you sign up okay great is there any else anyone else who would like to testify on house bill 1150 seeing none we're going to close the testimony portion of this hearing and now the bill is on the table for any amendments are there any amendments representative clinton smith thank you madam chair i have amendment l zero zero one and l zero zero two uh and they both address the same line of the bill so there may be a settled question unless one is offered as a substitute but the they sh they should both be considered together before we choose which one to move on i think okay why don't we pass them out and take a look at it and then once we get the bill the amendments passed out we will have you explain them thank you oh thank you [Applause] okay okay i think we all have copies now so the question is we're still missing one to avoid a subtle question we need to review the two amendments and determine which should go first is that right representative clinton thank you madam chair um and i'm happy to talk about both of these and i'm happy to move both of these but i don't know if i'm allowed to move my own amendment as a substitute to my own amendment why don't you explain them first so okay so i i talked with representative conte this morning let's talk about l02 first and i said why don't we add three simple words because oh i'm sorry the bill sponsor did not get a copy of the amendments here's uh another one for she's got so l02 was proposed because i noticed in the original bill line 17 we're adding or nicotine products but in the original bill line eight we're not adding or nicotine products so why did you add it to one part of the statute but not add it to the other part of the statute it seems like you're giving counties mixed guidance and so i thought to to make it consistent we should just add or nicotine products to both parts of the statute instead of just the one and i asked the drafter for that very simple amendment and she was great their drafter is here she brought me the amendment i requested it is l002 that's what i wanted to do and then the drafter also because she's a lawyer and i'm not she said when you do this it creates a problem in the definitions part of the statute and so she she drafted a proposed conforming amendment updating all the definitions at the same time and so that now becomes l001 so these two amendments are identical if you if you read the last line of l001 it's the same as l002 we're just adding those three words more nicotine products but also above that the drafter uh advised me and i think i'm fine with this and the bill sponsor is fine with this i've talked to representative conte is to update some conforming language to the other parts of the state statute so that or nicotine products is added in a handful of other places so that there's no conflict in the statute and i i would request that uh the drafter maybe come up and tell me if i got it right yes the bill director please come forward and reintroduce yourself again and respond to representative queen schmidt's question thank you thank you jennifer berman with the office of legislative legal services i do believe that representative klingenschmidt got that correct um for l001 lines 25 and 26 are kind of the meat of the amendment and they are the exact same as the amendment for l002 and lines uh 1 through 24 are essentially conforming amendments that would use consistent language throughout that statute 2514 301 to refer to cigarettes tobacco products or nicotine products so the way i'm interpreting this is that you should move l zero zero one yes ma'am i move l zero zero one there's a second second it's been moved and seconded by representative ransom is there any objection to l zero zero one seeing none l zero zero one passes and it's my understanding we won't need l02 is that correct that's right ma'am are there any other amendments seeing none we're going to close the amendment phase to the bill at this point are there any final comments before we take action on the bill representative lepsop just real quick madam chair i'm i'm opposed for a number of reasons um not the least of which the american cancer society is opposed to this bill in addition to all the i believe six other alliance members um the tobacco control alliance in addition to that opposition we heard professional opposition from an attorney from the aclu and even heard from even though cdphe testified neutral the mr kaplan simply stated that penalizing children has not been proven to reduce nicotine and tobacco use and so um for me this is a a fairly simple no vote president thurlow oh thank you madam chairman and i have to say i've changed my mind on this bill about three times during the testimony sorry and but but where i'm finally going to come down is i'm going to vote for the bill and it's it's based on you know we've gone through the law books quite extensively and it seems to me that even though it is now illegal to for an under 18 year old to possess cigarettes there is no penalty with the exception that cities can define their own penalty if they so choose and i think the the heart of the bill is just to give counties that same ability now what i would submit to everyone is that just because counties and just because cities have had that ability that doesn't necessarily mean that they've used it and as we go through all of the arguments about what's effective it's pretty clear to me that nobody knows what's effective some people think monetary penalties are effective some people think they're not some people think education is the answer and and probably everybody agrees with that but how do you do it so i i very much like mr bergman's argument that we have what's 63 counties and we have a whole bunch of cities and we have school districts and and they are just as well intentioned as we are and probably closer to the problem and and spend more time thinking about the problem of how to how to cut down on nicotine usage among young people so leaving that should given the counties the same ability that the cities have and then leaving everybody the ability in different places in colorado to do something in douglas county one way and to do it in dove creek a different way or mason county another way that to me makes a lot of sense so i'm going to vote for the bill rebsome ransom thank you madam chair i've raised teenagers you can talk until you're blue in the face and you can explain cessation programs and you can explain how unhealthy it is you can go with all of the statistics and data and sometimes you just need to have some penalties there are some teenagers that will not listen to everything that's logical i see teenagers smoking all the time i see it in denver i see it back in douglas county it breaks my heart because i have lost people to lung cancer as well in my family and i think that allowing counties to just establish some of the same parity and giving commissioners the ability to figure out what's going on in their county i actually counted i think there's six high schools that are in unincorporated douglas county and that means that if if you're up in denver those high schools that are within a city within denver they can have penalties if they choose but just because our high schools happen to be in unincorporated areas our commissioners can't and so um obviously i'm going to be a yes vote and thank you for bringing the bill representative conte for the comments represent singer thank you uh madame sharon to uh i guess reiterate representative lebsock's sentiments by i don't like this bill but i'm gonna vote yes um so uh i think this bill needs a lot of work um we we spent a lot of time in this committee just talking about uh with with director sobine about um looking at a cost-benefit analysis about how the scared straight program actually cost the state of mississippi 16 000 for every 65 spent it's a waste of money um so and and when i i was hoping to hear that douglas county had a plan or that they were trying to mimic something that another city was doing i haven't heard that either and and i understand some of the concerns about onerous um owners fines that's why we have the eighth amendment um in the constitution so i look forward long story short i look forward to seeing some floor amendments and letting the whole legislature deal with my rants because i think i think it is really important to talk about this i mean the cdc does have this report about uh preventing initiation of of tobacco use income indicators it's only 205 pages so i thought i would start with page one and now i mean i've sent it on to cci to have you guys take a look at it and see what you can come up with because we could be doing the wrong thing here we really could be i mean we we don't know i believe in more tools in a toolbox but if if those tools you know to carry out the metaphor a little further are faulty we could actually be harming harming the situation harming our kids and and that is a statewide matter of concern thank you it was in clinton smith thank you madam chair i'm pleased to join representative singer and what i perceive to be an anti-marijuana bill so i'll be voting yes for the comments madam chair i'll just before i let you have this last word i was just going to share my thoughts um and i clearly understand the impact of tobacco because my mom passed away because of lung cancer and so i believe that we should be doing all possible to prevent people from using tobacco and so for me awareness and prevention programs is the way to go but as we were talking about cigarettes and and youth and i think there is an increase of youth using cigarettes but what kept ringing in my mind is eric gardner who kept saying i can't breathe i can't breathe and the policeman stopped him because he was selling single cigarettes and so they put him in a choke hole and he lost his life so when i think about adding more penalties for cigarettes for a kid just for having possession of it just telling you where i'm coming from that gives another opportunity for law enforcement to interact with the youth now it may not happen in douglas county but i can tell you what happens in other jurisdictions and if we're going to be penalizing youth for having nicotine and tobacco products and it puts them in a situation where they have to pay tickets and fines and there'll be warrants or you have to maybe go to court i think that does set up a scenario from school to prison pipeline so i will be a no vote but it sounds like you have enough votes here for um to pass this bill but um i can't support the bill representative rodenthal thank you madam chair and um you know i have to admit i really struggled with this bill you know i'm a teacher and so i i i i've seen i've actually had a lot of discussions with the youth in my classes about you know drug use and cigarette use and um you know so you know i can see where the bill sponsor is trying to find you know multiple ways to reach these youth and and but i think as what was revealed in testimony that we heard you know by by the the advocates that they don't have any data i mean there's no background there's no research there's no best practices it and i'm i'm just frustrated by that um and and i wish there was more of that that we could say well you know what in i don't know let's say greeley colorado they did a they had their own fine program and it cut down use by 40 or or something like that and i just don't see it so i i can't uh support this bill today thank you madam chair i have to say that this is you know i think what we're used to seeing at the state level is the complete program laid out and i think somehow it's frustrating for us to let go and allow local counties govern themselves but i have complete confidence in those local elected officials that are closest to the problem and if they don't do the will of the people that elected them guess what they might not get reelected and that's how democracy works all we are doing is allowing them the freedom do you not think that they will be conferring with the center for disease control and our local uh health and human services department i think they absolutely will i think that they will come and they will work alongside them do you think that they will not do study sessions and go to and look at other places in other counties and see what they have done that might have worked i absolutely have sat in on some of those study sessions where county commissioners have sought and sit around and talk to with other commissioners and find out what have you done in your county what's worked there just as we do here at the state house i would ask you have a little faith in your local elected officials this is simply permissive this is simply saying you can enact whatever ordinance you want to enact maybe that ticket is going to be for three hours of an education class on the detrimental you know possibilities that smoking can bring to your life it may not be a fine penalty at all as far as monetary and that is in the purview of now the local counties as we would give them the authority but i don't know how much time you have spent with your county commissioners i've spent a fair amount i've sat in on their study sessions i've sat in when the local sheriffs came to talk to them i've sat and when the state came and talked to them i've sat when they when they sought out council at huge meetings with 64 of them around a table with representatives from all over the state and they conferred with one another i can tell you that they do not make decisions lightly and they understand that they are accountable and i understand that county sheriffs are accountable and if they are perceived at being onerous where kids are concerned and delivering penalties that are too harsh for the circumstances they will reap the benefits or the penalties from their constituents come election time colorado ranks 12th in the nation for teen smoking use we at the state level are set the policy our partners at the county level implement those policies as we allow them to all this bill does is give the freedom to say you can set the policies as you see fit we're not prescribing anything that they have to do we're saying we trust you to talk to the cdc to talk to the state health department to talk to your count other county commissioners to develop a program that's right for you and if that one includes penalties or fines as part of a comprehensive program we're giving you that authority knowing that you will stand before your voters come next election they are our boots on the ground they actually implement what we set up here at the state when we give them that authority i would encourage you listen to them they have unanimously across the state unanimously at that big meeting that i described with 64 counties sitting around the tables a representative from each one asked for this bill i encourage you to listen to your boots on the ground good bill vote yes thank you representative conte mr pachotta please call the world oh we need to move move the bell we need to have somebody take action on the bell will somebody germinal tell everyone representing the roraro committee of the home second second second by third loan now we can call the world representatives aren't no danielson um i just want to say real fast i heard what everyone had to say in committee including my fellow colleagues up here and i'm taking it into consideration so thanks for those who came to testify but i will be a yes today and then we're going to revisit and keep working on because there were a lot of really good points brought up so thank you for your time today klingon schmidt yes navarro ransom yes rosenthal no sane pass singer yes thurlow yes sane no websock no madam chair no 6'5 congratulations that pass is 6'5 you're on your way to the committee of the hole we members we have one more bill up and we have our last bill up representative wilson 1106 please come forward and tell us about your house bill don't you say that because now [Laughter] hi there good afternoon madam chair and local government committee members i see you're all wide awake and ready to get after it here i was going to thank you for rescuing me from beating a dead horse across the way but i saddled up a new one and came on over today i'd like to share house bill 16 1106 with you concerning the authority of a county to designate public roads as a section of a pioneer trail madam chair i know that as a member of the education committee that you already know my philosophy of bill presentations in committee for the rest of you here it is i believe there are three things to a good presentation brevity levity and repetition so what's in this bill i am glad that you asked the reader's digest version this bill will allow counties to identify and designate pioneer trails within their area several years ago there was a move at the federal level to identify pioneer trails within states somehow that effort fizzled imagine that at the federal level back in 2010 the colorado legislature passed a unanimous resolution to support federal legislation to pursue this issue but that did not seem to generate a lot of interest at that level so house bill 16 1106 is an effort to allow our counties to proceed with trail identification within the state while prodding the feds to finish what they started madam chair since the last bill you heard me present at a fiscal note of 242.9 million dollars you will be glad to know that the fiscal note on this bill is wait for it zero seriously pioneer trails are the arteries that supplied the lifeblood to the state of colorado in years past native americans the french the spanish lewis and clark pike long dodge kearney fremont gunnison even beckworth the first african-american mountain man settled here in denver which you don't know that if you don't go back and study some of the the pioneer issues the list can go on and on pioneers who made colorado what it is today or what we're talking about here usually at this point i would quote some cowboy philosopher but for this bill i think cicero said it best and i know that surprises representative lebsock and i even know who sister rowe was but he said to be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child for what is the worth of human life unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of history that's what we're talking about here are pioneer pathways this bill will enable counties to weave another piece of the tapestry of history each county will be able to complete its piece of the quilt we call pioneer history here in colorado and as you look at that do you find such things as those of you that are old enough to remember the movie jeremiah johnson jeremiah johnson actually rode the arkansas river valley he was actually a law enforcement officer in leadville colorado so those are the things that we're talking about here i ask for your support of house bill 16 1106 are there any questions that i can refer to the expert witnesses thank you madam chair and good work on this bill representative wilson i think it's a good bill there was an amendment that's been talked about are are you going to be presenting your bill along with that amendment um today thank you madam sharon thank you representative lebsock for that question it doesn't alter the the makeup of the bill there's just some procedural things in there so if we could because the witnesses have been waiting for so long i'd like to have the witnesses come forward and then i'll introduce the amendment if that's fine thank okay so other questions seeing them we're going to move into the testimony portion let's bring up miss linda follow pretty close fella hello please come forward introduce yourself looks like everyone's for your bill so there's no opposition thanks for waiting thank you madam chair committee members i'm linda bailo i'm the director of the department of historic preservation uh heritage tourism and community development for park county uh that that committee also manages one of colorado's three national heritage areas the south park national heritage area i'm also a member of the board of colorado preservation inc and a former advisor for colorado tourism office heritage and tourism committee um colorado is very lucky it has these wonderful trails these representative of our history and i think what we have with the advantage of the local grassroots county commissioners being able to designate these trails is not just the other two parts of my committee of of our my title of tourism and community development but also the heritage and that's a way to impart that heritage these trails crisscross colorado and it's a way to identify what's in the backyard for our young people oh we're we're on the the zebulun pike trail well that's pretty interesting now now the interest is there so on the community development side of just taking our own areas and our own students and our own people who have moved there to understand the value of where they live then with that with that ability to identify this history this also then brings us to the tourism part of the advantages and one of the things we've learned and i made little notes here from two or three studies with the colorado tourism office longworth and our longwood and mile studies for outdoor recreation number one on the list of why people come to colorado is historic places number two is culture and and what they find there so they're already wanting to come the increase in the people that are coming for that by being able to designate this on an individual county basis the grassroots people saying we've got something special here the folks are going to want to come and then number three that they were listing is what people want to do on their vacation this kind of surprised me they want to discover something they want to explore something so the fact that it's not been pushed forward and we have the opportunity now for each county to say we've got a section of this trail here and we're going to promote that maybe the next county doesn't want to do it but they're looking for something different to do and that sense of exploration is going to bring the kind of traveler that we like to have here they'll be respectful of what we have they spend more money and they stay longer we've found that and that goes across the board whether it's boomers or the generation xers who have the the kids to bring along now or whether it's the millennials they all have that same degree about 70 percent are looking for that exploration thing so we're just we're just running with that and giving the the counties the ability to go and do that and then following that of course is the economic development in in park county we have no business that has more than 25 employees all of our businesses are moms and pops and those are the kind of things that these people are looking forward to for the exploration finding that little out of the way restaurant or that little shop over there and that just puts a little bit more money in everybody's pocket so it has it it addresses what we have to offer here on so many levels from educating our kids and our newly arrived people to how valuable where they live is and the fact that these trails very often are going through areas in the in the state that really get the biggest benefit from this as it comes through park county it's going through a part that has not been high on the on the list of attractions and yet if you drive the part of the zebulum pike trail which is one of the examples that we'll have of a trail that can be quite meaningful it goes through the the little towns that people would miss otherwise and uh through part of it that you feel like you probably see zebra and pike over the hill because there's nothing else there so you get that whole feeling of why colorado is so attractive in the first place that's what attracted me and that's why i live here thank you so very much questions seeing them thank you for your time today good job thank you mr pike please come forward introduce yourself and who you represent oh good afternoon i know why you guys earn your money now um thank you uh madam chair and the board i appreciate being a chance to speak here my name is brian pike i'm vice president of the pike national uh historic trail as rep wilson said it's been a tough battle for us at the federal level i'm extremely pleased that you brought this up at the state level because we probably are the greatest state to put this forward and i come before you to ask that you'll support house bill 1106 the pioneer trail bill this bill would bring increased notoriety the rich history of colorado and provide support to our valued tourism industry and at a time where bipartisan ship is greatly needed this bill's a no-brainer no cost local control and it highlights important historical routes that were vital to our great state and the nation please allow me a brief moment to share one example of a pioneer of colorado my uncle albeit a few generations removed zebulun montgomery pike and to paraphrase the words of historian robert m warner few men have left such impressive monuments preserve their memories of zebulun montgomery pike whose memorial is probably america's best known mountain pike's peak was discovered in 1806 during pike southwest expedition that included his historic trek through our great state this was a second expedition into the interior of the newly acquired louisiana territory and eventually led to the development of the santa fe trail in addition to his career as a soldier pike published a book detailing his accounts and findings of his two western treks in 1810 and this was four years before the lewis and clark's contemporary account this book was so popular it was translated into french german and dutch for publication in europe pike's career however was destined to be of short duration the war of 1812 at the rank of brigadier general pike led the united states army assault on a brit at the british at york which is present-day toronto the capital of upper canada at the time and on april 25th 1813 his forces of about 1700 troops sailed from sac at harbor sackett's harbor new york across lake ontario to successfully attack the british fort near the end of the battle the british exploded their powder magazine sending stones and debris into all directions and pike was struck by a flying object and died at the battle of york at the age of 34. president thomas jefferson said zebulun pike was an american hero a patriot who lived and died for his country and it would be fitting and appropriate that pioneers of this caliber be remembered and honored for their significant contribution to colorado and america the pioneer trail trail bill will honor our colorado pioneers and there's many more than pike but i wanted to share that one example obviously very near and dear to my heart please support house bill 1106 and consider the pike trail as one of the models we've done a lot of the work we've got uh phone apps going out we've got sign boards and you name it so as we've talked about there's very little cost we can use it as a model and many others to follow and it will exploit our rich tradition and think before the ski industry what the greatest what the greatest tourism attraction was and it could very well have been pike's peak most likely it was it's the best known american mountain in europe it's why people come to colorado and many of the things that linda said is exactly correct there's many others to follow i very much thank you for your time i appreciate your efforts rep wilson thank you very much and have a great afternoon thank you let's see if there's any questions for you any question of this witness representative uh thank you matthew thank you for taking the time especially you know considering the hour so i won't belabor it too much i was really hoping to see some pictures since we're talking about sort of the scenic heritage of colorado here but you know i i look forward to you know when this when this bill passes you know seeing what it really looks like and maybe we can have local government do a field trip so absolutely that'd be great i've got a a few little bits on maps if you guys would like to have them yeah and and since you uh since you asked the question i'll give you the lucky sticker here we go there you go i have a question certainly you get one thank you so much appreciate it any other questions seeing that thank you for your time today thank you very much nurse shy please come forward introduce yourself madam chair committee members my name is kit shy i'm a county commissioner by election a land surveyor by profession and a by choice i feel i'm in good company here today in 2006 i gathered or i went together with four other county commissioners in the southern part of the state and achieved a dola grant to commemorate pikes trail we placed 16 roadside markers at key points along pike's journey across the state zebulun pike of course was one of the early explorers in colorado and one that needs to be commemorated but in the next 25 years we're going to hit the 200th anniversary of lots of other people who made it to the west the um i was really fortunate with the people that i worked with the cartographer from retired cartographer from national geographic magazine designed our panels we had clive siegel with the the santa fe trail association county commissioners workers from the forest service the blm the state parks all worked on these 16 panels that we have up around the state i'm glad to say that they've been up for 10 years and i inspect them all on occasion and we have yet to have any vandalism to them and an awful lot of emails and comments on the quality of them the 16 panels are in private land state parks county roads blm pike's fort san isabel national forest u.s highway 50 and 160 and the towns of silvercliff alamosa canyon city and florence the group that we put together to do that we've all stuck together pretty well actually since 2006 and we keep together by email there's a hundred person list email that we started when we first started this project and for a full year every morning on my email was an excerpt from pike's journal for that very day from 200 years ahead so we are a tight-knit group and we do feel strongly about having this bill pass it's a simple bill it has no um economic connection to it at all we're very proud to be a part of what's going to go on with if this bill does pass quite often we end up getting run over by the rock that rolls downhill from the feds and we have a feeling that maybe we can push the rock uphill from our from the county level to the federal government to get them inspired to continue with this bill there's a lot of passion with people that are connected with this i was really pleased to see one of the pike family here today there are a lot of descendants i've met kit carson's direct descendants in the course of doing this work as well so we um are in great support of it i think that what we've all learned in the works that we've done on the pike trail is that the journey is as important as the destination and many many journeys came through colorado and we need to commemorate them we have a lot of history to pass on to our children and this is just one step in that process i thank you for the opportunity to make testimony and if you have any questions for me looks like everybody just looks like one of those slam dunks is it because it's the end of the day or um because it's a really good bill i hope it's because it's a good bill thank you thank you madam chair i'm just reading this wonderful map that you gave us of the adventures of zebulon montgomery pike what in 1806 was a young army lieutenant and there's a map here it says in his handwriting he says here i left doherty and sparks who were froze so bad as to not be able to march so here's these apparently two frozen sergeants and they may still be buried there but i'm wondering will your bill give counties the maybe the possibility to reenact this map i mean you have a map here in his handwriting and maybe put a sign where the bodies of those two young men may still be buried today to remember the the sacrifice of the pioneers who went and and marched with zebulon pike to discover america yes in answer to your question those men did not die on the trail they froze their feet they got gangrene he left them behind and after he was captured by the spanish they allowed him to go back and get those two men who he left in a camp killed two buffalo for them to live on while he was gone in his journey that he went all the way from missouri through colorado and down to chihuahua mexico where he was imprisoned he all of his men made it and he's responsible for making that happen as as we did our commemorative signs he would leave people behind either to take care of horses to get their health back or because they were injured but as the journey progressed all of them either caught up or he went back and got them the only two men that did not return from his expedition killed each other in jail in mexico in a fight he had one member they did fall off a little bit and our commemorative signs show that the group would shrink up or grow back together as they caught up at one point he had to abandon his horses and go on foot and he left people to take care of the horses and then they caught up later on so he got them all back further questions thank you for the history lesson thank you at this point the bill is there anyone else out there that would like to testify on this bill house bill 1106 seeing none we're going to close the testimony portion of this bill at this point the bill is on the table for any amendments are there any amendments representative no amendments we do have an amendment oh there is minimum [Applause] so representative tell us about this amendment uh yes thank you madam chair uh this amendment uh represents two or three concerns that came up over the bill conservation colorado was concerned that and those of you that have been on public land blm or whatever there may be a road that's going through number 2705 and then branching off from that is wilson's atv trail that was unauthorized and it just went off in the middle of nowhere the concern there was that these trails that they're designated are actually uh designated on roads that are open to travel is the is the phrase that's important there so lines two through uh five addresses that concern that's also down on line 16 through 18 about the designation of the roads if they are on federal government land that the government will be notified about that the second concern was the state highway piece that cdot talked to me about the fact that if you have a trail that comes on a county road 160 and happens to go on highway 285 for five miles and it moves off on county road 195 what do you do about that section so this allows for the designation of that but it also stipulates if you will look lines through six through 11 this says that if that does affect the state highway that the general assembly by resolution will designate that part of the state highway so you just can't randomly go out and mark that and put signs up and so forth that actually has to go through that process the third thing that it does on lines 22-26 that's more of a property rights as the rafter said it's a belt and suspender thing that just simply uh guarantees that nothing in this section will affect any rights away or ownership of any of the roads and so forth just clarifying those pieces the colorado counties support this and conservation colorado with that piece for the conservation they're behind it and cdot was on board with it as well so that's what the amendment does representative clinton thank you madam chair i i do object to this amendment uh not because you're not trying to do the right thing most of this looks great but in the first paragraph here you're talking about public lands and yet they are prohibited from travel by the federal government so in other words they're no longer public lands even though they're called public the federal government is restricting access to these lands and i think the counties ought to be able to label those as pioneer trails anyway just to encourage the public to retake possession of their own land so in principle i'm opposed to that part of this amendment and therefore i'll be a no on this amendment representative wilson did you want to respond and then represent singer uh thank you madam chair and and representative clinton smith i i understand what you're saying there and the reason why that was included was that it is what it is with those lands designated this was simply to include the fact that the counties could if they so chose to designate those roads that go through the federal land as part of the pioneer trail and not have to worry about getting permission from the federal government as long as those roads are open to travel it was specifically set as one question was raised could we have a horse trail no these are roads that are open to travel because people will be traveling and the most mobile way of traveling for those would be by uh automobile or in those cases where atvs are actually allowed with wheeled vehicles as well represent singer thank you madam chair i i may have missed this did anyone move the amendment yet uh i move l03 second it's been moved and seconded the amendment no he objected to the amendment yeah so we have to call the vote amen on the um amendment representatives aren't yes danielson why don't you go ahead and pass and go get to the other members klingon schmidt no navarro ransom yes rosenthal yes sane no singer yes yes danielson yes websock yes ma'am chair yes that amendment passes 9-2 9-2 are there any other amendments seeing none we're going to close the amendment phase are there any comments before we take final action on this bill representative saying thank you madam chair and representative wilson this bill is already a good idea but i think you had me at the fiscal note of zero so i'd like to move this bill with a favorable recommendation to the committee of the whole second it's been moved and seconded as amended as amended any other comments before we call for the role for the vote representative singer if anyone has extra stickers please bring them back to me thank you all righty representative wilson thank you madam sharon just quickly folks i'd like to point out commissioner shy comments the excitement that he has on being involved with that i can see that excitement spreading across the state of colorado with the various pioneer trails and so forth are recognized and perhaps we get the feds to actually follow up on that but it's an exciting thing to see people testify about what we can actually have here so thank you for for listening to us and and please support 1106. representatives aren't yes danielson for the pioneers representative wilson yes klingon schmidt yes navarro ransom yes rosenthal yes sane yes singer yes thurlow yes websock yes madam chair yes congratulations that bill's passes unanimously it's on its way to the committee of the hole we are adjourned committee thank you madam chair

get three minutes hi madam chair my name is chris bowie i'm from denver public health and on the policy and partnerships coordinator and i'm here to testify in support of house bill 1137 and hope that everybody else will too and i'm lisa and i'm lisa van ramdunk the executive director of the colorado association of local public health officials and i think we'll let chris go first and i'll follow up go ahead thank you so denver public health is definitely in support of this bill with the proposed amendments that we'll probably talk about in a little bit denver public health provides a wide range of programs and services that encourages nicotine free living and prevention of this generation's youth to succumb to nicotine exposures we educate on the known and unknown dangers of electronic cigarettes and provide cessation tools for those that are addicted to nicotine i have to say that nicotine is a highly addictive substance and it's addictive in any amount and i think that's what our concern is for today with the warning labels nicotine concentration affects severity of the addiction and it's definitely magnified for youth adolescents and young adults whose brains are still developing and studies show that so i just want to wrap up keep it brief denver public health sees labeling as responsible and preventative measure that addresses what our state communities and businesses concerns are regarding the toxic nature of nicotine and the addictive nature of nicotine we've heard testimony that a lot of businesses are are in the dark they would like to receive guidance and i think this is the opportunity that we can provide them this also helps our communities and it's the ability to just be responsible to not only our youth but also to our businesses that are looking for guidance so on behalf of denver public health we'd like for everybody to please vote to pass house bill 1137 thank you madam chair and representatives and i can field questions there any questions at this point we can also ask questions after the next witness all right why don't you go ahead thank you madam chair again i'm lisa van ramdunk the executive director of the colorado association of local public health officials we are the association that represents all of the local health departments in colorado every county is covered by a local health department and in your individual jurisdictions you may find that you work with more than one public health department we've got a lot of great experts we heard some terrific testimony the other day and so i will certainly defer some of the technical questions to those great experts but i did want to come here and tell you that calfo is in support of house bill 1137. our local public health agencies are engaged in their communities as many of you well know in helping current tobacco and nicotine users quit and in helping prevent youth and others from starting to use these addictive products in many of our public health programs our public health professionals are working with new moms and families to help them ensure safe environments in their home where their children can grow up to be healthy and so the idea of labeling is is certainly a place where we can help ensure those safe and healthy homes for kids and i think as with denver public health we broadly as public health agencies see this type of labeling as a reasonable step towards helping community members make informed decisions about what they put into their bodies and helping inform parents and other adults to prevent accidental ingestion of these products by children so thanks thank you are there any questions for either one of these witnesses yes oh representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair uh and thank you both for your testimony miss von rimdenk uh is when i was first given the idea for this bill it was by a county health official who was out there in the community trying you know they have a charter they're out there trying to help families and they brought me some of these deceptive bottle labels which we have pictures of and you know without my bill and without labels it's kind of the wild west out there i think the real retailers are trying to figure out what is best to put on the labels but in the absence of guidance does it leave in your opinion room for either a lack of information or deceptive information so that teenagers and moms are having this argument about what's really in the mystery bottle miss van remdunk thank you madam chair thank you representative um yeah i think you know generally we support the um broad idea of informed consumers and i would agree that with the enormous variety of um labeling that we see and the the actual contents of these these bottles that this is one instance where stronger labeling requirements really do equal um a more informed consumer i think there's we can debate labeling on a lot of other a lot of other substances food that we put in our body but this is certainly one of those labels that seems a lot more a lot more common sense and a lot less controversial any further questions thank you both very much for your testimony uh mr clinton representative clinton schmidt we have one more signed up in favor um so shall we go forward with mr kaplan yes ma'am all right is mr kaplan here there he is come on up and tell us who you are and who you're here representing good afternoon madam chairwoman uh representative mccann and members of the committee my name is gabriel kaplan i am chief of the health promotion and chronic disease prevention branch in the prevention services division at the colorado department of public health and environment on behalf of dr walk the department's executive director and the colorado's chief medical officer i'm pleased to be here today to convey the department's support for house bill 1137 concerning a requirement that package nicotine products have a warning label we have numerous points of entry and interest in this legislation we are concerned about accidental poisonings we're concerned about nicotine and its health effects but primarily we're concerned about nicotine as a pathway to a lifelong addiction to tobacco products tobacco kills well over 5000 of our residents every year and we know that for every death there's about 30 more individuals who suffer from lifelong tobacco-related chronic illnesses uh the financial costs of this burden are tremendous and so we are doing everything in our power to limit the effects of this addiction and problem uh this bill would require simply the products that contain nicotine except for cigarettes a few other products and approved cessation devices carry a warning label that simply states the product contains addictive nicotine there are some amendments uh which do a bit more but that's the primary focus of the legislation all the products that we're talking about today represent novel ways of delivering nicotine products and these are an emerging challenge for public health very little is known about these products and very little regulations particularly in colorado exist for them and despite a lack of understanding about them their popularity is rising we know that colorado has actually been singled out as a test market for unregulated products such as these and this uh this test actually has been enormously successful data shows that from 2012 to 2013 the increase in sales of starter kits for e-cigarettes and cartridge refills increased first for starter kits by 500 percent and by cartridge refills almost a thousand dollars in convenience stores uh sorry a thousand percent in convenience stores so uh we can see that this popularity is rising and we see this in our data of colorado youth as well we'd like to correct the impression that e-cigarettes are a cessation device there is data that indicates smokers are interested in using these products as a cessation device unfortunately the data doesn't support that these actually work as a cessation device in fact the most recent study which came out just a month ago showed that if you were a smoker and you started using e-cigarettes you were 28 less likely to smoke to quit smoking than if you didn't use e-cigarettes at all and that if you're a vapor and you are not yet a smoker your odds of becoming a smoker are actually 15 to 40 times greater the american family of pedia academy of pediatrics did a study of about 35 of these products and found there were substantial discrepancies between what they contained and what was on the label and while the fda has proposed rules which will require labeling uh those rules are not likely to come out uh for some time we're not quite sure where the omb is on that process and in addition the regulation states that the rule would require these postings 24 months after the rule is released so if that gets held up in court it could be a substantial amount of time before any labels appear on these products and stores we know that warning labels work we know this from our experience with tobacco control when you see a label you're more likely to think about quitting you're more likely to hesitate and for all of these reasons we would ask you to support house bill 1137 and we think that warning labels are a good common sense public health strategy thank you for your time and happy to answer any questions you might have thank you mr kaplan are there any questions for mr kaplan so i have a question um because i happen to have some nursing students meeting with me this morning and um we were talking about another bill but i just was chatting about this bill it was interesting because one of the nurses said that she used to smoke so i asked her about the e-vapor issue and in fact she used it to quit smoking um which was interesting to me she said she did reduce as the woman testified on tuesday that she did actually decrease her amount of nicotine and it took her about a month but she has successfully quit so i'm interested in the data that you were talking about because it does seem as though some people do use these as you know to help them quit i don't know that i call it a cessation device but um have you all studied at all locally about how um in colorado how these may have been used to help people quit smoking if you know mr kaplan thank you madam chairman uh we uh have not looked locally at this data we have just looked at the studies that have been done on national level i'm not aware or familiar with any studies that have been done locally i myself have no doubt that there are lots of anecdotal instances where an individual was able to use these products to successfully say from smoking the problem though is on the mass when you look across a large number of people which is what our responsibility in public health is is to look at the broad population and for every individual who might um successfully quit there are multiple individuals who to simply fail and what the data shows what this most recent study both a study in england and a meta-analysis performed in the united states show was that um if you take up a cessation strategy using e-cigarettes you're actually 28 less likely to quit than if you didn't and if you use other approved cessation devices now there are lots of approved cessation devices that are available to colorado residents through the colorado quit line and any resident who calls up regardless of their insurance status would be able to go through a quit strategy and receive coaching from the quit line which is sponsored by national jewish which has testified in support of this legislation thank you any other questions for mr kaplan all right oh representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and thank you mr kaplan for coming i'm glad to have the department's support on one of my bills the there is a amendment being proposed that would exempt from our labeling requirements any product that the federal food and drug administration has approved as a tobacco use cessation product so i understand from your testimony that most e-vaping liquids are not yet on that fda list but if they did someday gain access to that last and the fda approved them as a cessation product then would this amendment remove the labeling requirements in question mr kaplan thank you madam chairwoman i believe it would um the you know we are not opposed to uh the vape uh industry and and vaping in and of itself our concern right now is that it's a it likely shows and this is what the data shows uh that it's a pathway to addiction to actual tobacco products and right now we don't have evidence that these work as a cessation device on the broad scale and so if the fda were to perform a study and if the science seemed to indicate that the data were changing over time then we would certainly welcome these as a cessation strategy if that could be shown the point we have is that right now we don't see that and so for that reason they wouldn't be exempt under the amendment representative thank you madam chair and thank you mr kaplan i just on tuesday we heard that the fda was going to approve this within a matter of weeks or months is that your impression as well mr kaplan madam chairman thank you uh so there is usually about a 90-day process uh for the omb to review uh the proposed rule uh from the fda and uh they received the rule from the fda um in about october so they're actually a little overdue for having released it so it could well be that it it does come out shortly we anticipate that there are probably lots of concerns uh across the board with that regulation and so that might hold up the release further we simply don't know when it's likely to come out what we do know is the proposed rule which we all saw about a year and a half ago stipulated that these warning labels that are called for in the regulation won't appear for two years after the release rule date of the rule uh and so for two years these labels will not be required by fda regulations so even from today we're going to go two years without any labels and then as has happened several times with fda actions in this area there's the likelihood of a lawsuit to hold up the implementation of the rule and injunctions and such could pull that implementation period much longer thank you any further questions representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and since our last meeting i was handed this statement from the federal register and i'd like to ask you about it the the proposed federal warning label that may be coming forth has one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve words uh compared to gordon's magic four words my magic four words are warning contains addictive nicotine but this is a proposed label that says warning this product contains nicotine derived from tobacco nicotine is an addictive chemical leave it to the feds to say in 12 words what i've already said before but my question is even at the end of this 90-day period isn't there like a 12-step process this is at the end of the 90 days i was told it's just the first step that might be approved and that is for the feds to decide if they can even have authority to label these things mr kaplan so uh thank you madam chairman i that is a question that's sort of little beyond my expertise federal regulations are not something i understand very closely my understanding from looking at this information in the interim between tuesday's testimony and today was that the rule-making process is a nine-step process and when it goes to omb uh it is at the eighth step and so the ninth step would be approval from omb uh for the fda to release it uh and then fda would proceed to think about sort of an implementation timeline they could be as aggressive my understanding from what i read uh to call for the immediate um sort of implementation of the rule which would then initiate the clock they would set off a two year waiting period but they may sort of get held up for a variety of reasons so i think you know your allusion to challenges with federal operations is a good one we don't really know what's likely to happen all right see no further questions thank you very much for your testimony thank you madam chairman thank you members of the committee and thank you representative klingenschmidt we'll now move to uh individuals who signed up in opposition um let's start with catherine york good afternoon ms york if you'll tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone sorry hi my name is catherine york i'm here on behalf of the colorado chapter of the smoke-free alternatives trade association also known as safada i'm the chairwoman for our board and i'm also here on behalf of uh my small business located in denver called boosted llc we are an e-liquid manufacturer i'm also a licensed attorney and accordingly i am going to speak to you a little bit more about the federal regulations um i have only been with the company for six months but my husband started it and after leaving private practice i came over full-time but my background should allow me to answer a couple of the questions that maybe were unresolved earlier um so here's a printed out copy of the notice of proposed rulemaking applicable uh in this instance the deeming regulations that were first released in april of 2014 by the fda there was a comment period it closed back in 2014 it is cr uh this rulemaking is in the final stage of the regulatory process at the federal level it it omb the office of management and budget or o ira is another um right part of that they have been reviewing this since october 19th so it is a little bit more than 90 days they are allowed to give themselves a 30-day extension for a total of 120 days for review and we i'm under the impression based on speaking with our federal lobbyists that that's what's happened in this case and accordingly we expect that the regulations will be finalized within weeks um in this regulation it does in fact propose the warning that representative clayne schmidt uh read and the fda uh has not allowed us to call ourselves cessation devices because this is the only type of regulation they are allowed to um issue for our product based on a few court cases including the saterra case that was from 2010. specifically this regulation is uh was issued based on the fda's authority under the tobacco control act um the long version of that name is the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act of 2009 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic cosmetic act allowing the fda to regulate nicotine products or tobacco products uh which was defined as or which was defined to include products that were derived from tobacco products which is why our nicotine products which although they aren't like a traditional tobacco product are being regulated as tobacco products and are subject to the tobacco control act now part of the tobacco control act in section 916 is that there is an express preemption clause for a variety of things including labeling which is why as soon as these regulations are issued under the tobacco control act authority the fda regulations will expressly preempt any contrary state labeling requirement and um i believe uh representative clinton schmidt may be aware of this because the expected amendment has something to do with uh include something about fed contrary federal language is that correct that really mandated language and so i i believe he's aware of the express preemption clause but um that so our conclusion your your time is up oh i'm just gonna just sort of wrap up i'll give you a few another minute or so to wrap up we're just concerned that having state requirements that we're required to submit to in addition to these expected federal laws like are impossible for our businesses to do uh the these products are can remain on a shelf for a year and so the small businesses that buy these products and are unable to sell them during that time um are not able to plan for the future if we have a a state law that's going into effect on the first of january and we have to plan for this federal regulation so i'm just concerned for our businesses the and i believe that it's a waste of uh the legislature's time because of the expected federal regulations all right are there questions for ms york representative lyongraph thank you man madam chair can you tell me ballpark um what these products bring in annually to our state i do not have numbers for our state specifically but it is a billion dollar industry and we have more than 150 small uh businesses operating as retail outlets so that uh they're mostly mom and pop shops and they're spread across the state um and so those stores you know having inventory is expensive for them and they're concerned that they will not be able i'm sorry that's sort of not your question but they're concerned about being able to comply with this law as well as plan for their inventory um throughout the year and buying quantities and all of the things you would expect from a labeling bill representative blankraft thank you madam chair so if the federal law goes through every product that is produced will have this labeling or whatever labeling they come up with yes ma'am on it yes york um yes sorry uh catherine york uh i was supposed to introduce myself yes all of uh our products are going to say warning this product contains nicotine derived from tobacco nicotine is an addictive chemical unfortunately we're not sure if the feds have decided to change that that's part of the mystery of the rule making process and so we can't actually change our labels yet to comply with the expected regulation because if they change like three words in there then we're that we have to start over anyways it's it's sort of a tough spot for us representative blancraft thank you madam chair so if this bill goes through you could conceivably have to change your labeling and then and maybe label all these products with this language and then the feds could come in and use one or two different words to get to the same point and you would have to redo yes ma'am and that is a um yes that is exactly our problem and for example my company has hundreds of thousands of labels like on hand right now and we would have to reprint all of them um in order to comply and that's the manufacturer's perspective the shops have a different perspective obviously but changing our labels multiple times just because there is a state law requirement is very difficult thank you uh representative eskar thank you madam sharon thank you mr york for being here you just talked about how you have hundreds of thousands of labels already um set to go how long have you all been aware that there's going to be something even coming from the feds when it comes to labeling this york uh thank you um we technically have been aware since it was introduced in april of 2014. however the regulations were not submitted to the final stage at omb until october of last year and so we try to think about planning but we are also aware that we need to be able to still maintain our supply chain so that we're not out of labels when we go because we have multiple flavors and we make each one of them in five strings of nicotine so that you can go down over time um so it's a lot of labels it's a lot of ways represent vascular thank you madam chair and i believe last time we were all together i'm going to say her name wrong with sven drewska bondroska was here and she brought different bottles from her store and some of them had labels do the labels you're talking about for your company already have warnings on them can some of the labels have warnings on them already miss york um yes ma'am i have not seen a bottle that is uh sold in a retail location that doesn't have some sort of warning i actually uh don't remember seeing any that uh representative clinton schmidt was able to find either so i think it's standard in our industry to have some sort of warning about the product containing nicotine i think the concern uh was brought up that some people have something that says may contain nicotine on their non-nicotine strength uh e-liquid my products do not have that but some products apparently do though i do believe that would make it easier to keep those products out of the hands of children because i believe that was brought up and that seemed to be a corollary issue though i i have not seen any products that contain nicotine that do not have a warning on them in and i've seen thousands of different products at these trade shows and uh speaking with our retail locations that we do business with thank you so i have just a quick question so your business is just the manufacturing you don't do any retail uh yes ma'am we then wholesale to about 1500 retail locations across the country and we do business in 45 states which means that when any state would propose something like this we would be concerned because we would want to be able to comply with that state law and that's why we welcome reasonable regulation some parts of the uh notice of proposed rulemaking are not quite as reasonable as we would like but this part makes sense so that there's a standard warning um and at it's appropriate at the federal level to have this type of labeling requirement so that it is standard and we can do business freely in interstate commerce so um so what kind what are the labels that you have in stock do they contain what warning do they contain see um my all of my products that contain nicotine state that they contain nicotine they contain uh they i believe they all say nicotine is an addictive drug or something similar and then they have the prop 65 california labeling requirement which is to state that nicotine uh may cause birth defects and other reproductive harm all of my labels including the ones without nicotine say keep away from children and pets and must be over the age of 18 to use or possess that is just something that we as an industry have adopted as a standard thing even even with the non-nicotine products just because we do not want kids getting their hands on it our target audience is the 45 million adult smokers in the united states i mean it's an amazing number but it's true there are significant numbers of adult smokers in the united states that yes it's anecdotal evidence but many of them have written us thank you letters as the manufacturer saying that we save their life and you know you can't totally just ignore that if you're a manufacturer it feels it's difficult to hear the testimony sorry i'm rambling but it's difficult to hear testimony demonizing our products when there was a longitudinal multi-year study in the united kingdom that found that e-cigarettes are 95 less harmful than traditional cigarettes and that 5 was mostly based on uncertainty because you know there's unknowns in the world but that also 44 of the population in the united kingdom did not realize that e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking public perception of our products is based on how they look and on and fear and uncertainty but the science that has been done is is not quite as uh bad as it might have been made out to be i would be happy to send um the study itself it was more than 100 pages so i didn't print it out i have a summary if anyone would like that from uh the public health study i i don't know if that's appropriate but if it is please let me know i don't think any of us want a 100-page study there's a summary it's only three maybe a summary yes representative thank you madam chair and just to follow up you said that you already have the california law labeling my question is if this law were to pass would you have to put colorado's label on it california's label on or would you have to do separate labels for separate states miss york it's not quite as bad as having to do separate labels for separate states though if there's more than one or two states that are having requirements the space runs out as you saw like we already have to use very small writing and that was remarked upon and we are concerned that at some point it will be illegible if we have to fit everything on our bottles um and the i would also like to point out that the california market is extremely different than the colorado market we are not as big a market as california a lot of e-liquid manufacturers are willing to change their labels for california so that they can still do business with those thousand literally thousands of brick and mortar locations for specialty vape stores but here in colorado we are not that big of a market and i think that that really harms the small businesses operating in colorado because those retail locations are competing with each other so they having different products in each store is great but if you remove the variety then they have less to compete with each other and they're definitely are not able to compete with online products that it is almost impossible for us to really enforce a labeling requirement against representative valantine thank you madam chair how far off are we from the california law ms york that has already been enacted it was it's not specific to our industry there's something called prop 65 and they have about 60 chemicals anytime one of those products is found in a one of those chemicals is found in a product that product must write a prop 65 warning i'll tell you that when i went to disneyland uh with my family this last summer there was a giant prop 65 sign in front of disneyland saying disneyland may contain chemicals known by the state of california to cause birth defects or cancer and that's the prop 65 warning and so although it's very bizarre and it does make people very concerned when they see it on our products it is not limited to the vape industry and it is just a product of california's regulatory system all right anyone going to disneyland remember that warning before you go um are there any further questions yes sir mr representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and thank you mr york for your testimony you know after our last hearing i met many of miss york's clients out in the hall and they showed me bottle after bottle many of them with the california label on them and i first of all want to commend you and your retailers for self-initiating for being above board for being very honest with the consumer about what's in your labels and on the record i'd like to state all of the labels you showed me i believe are comparable to the language that we would require in colorado law and so when you see amendment 002 later it says federally mandated language or the following or comparable language i think your excellent retailers are already meeting what will be the colorado standard by offering comparable products what we are trying to get after are some of these other mystery bottles and you said you've never seen these but they're out there and there's other less ethical perhaps or at least less forthcoming manufacturers that are producing things they don't even list the ingredients on some of these on the front it says zero nicotine on the back it says contains nicotine there is no uniform standard and so while your retailers are meeting a very high standard and thank you for doing that there are others that we're trying to bring up to your standard and that's the intention of my law um i wasn't sure if there was a question in there but i did have a question about what that statement um do you mean that products that just say contains nicotine would meet your standard representative klingon schmidt uh thank you madam chair and thank you for the question i think we'd have to say something about being addictive also but okay otherwise it's pretty comparable i think so that is my concern because you work go ahead my concern is that not all of this the products even though they are labeled quite clearly in a variety of ways um already say addictive so that does mean that a number that literally thousands of out-of-state manufacturers would have to change their labels in order to do business here we as in-state manufacturers uh would be likely to change them just because we would want to still do business in our own state obviously um but that represents a significant burden on the small businesses the tens of thousands of small businesses in our industry all right thank you seeing no other questions thank you for your testimony ms york all right ian firth you tell us uh who you are and if you're here representing anyone and just so um witnesses know there is um on the table in front of you a timer so when it is green you are good uh when it turns yellow you have 30 seconds left and when it turns red you are done so keep that in mind if you come up to testify all right go ahead mr firth is this on my name is ian firth uh oh sorry uh go ahead good afternoon comedian can you pull the microphone down a little bit closer there you go my name is ian firth i am the owner of a colorado-based e-liquid manufacturer i am also a co-chair and founder of the colorado chapter of the smoke-free alternatives trade association i have some clarifications on some notes or testimony that was given on tuesday can i add those to the record uh on tuesday we heard from various uh people about certain things i wanted to clarify those there was a comment made about e-liquid being available at retail at 500 milligrams strength that would actually be a 50 concentration of pure nicotine the current agreed upon ld50 of pure nicotine is 500 milligram for an adult so consuming orally one mil one milliliter of such e-liquid would be fatal in fifty percent of examples nothing like that is sold or available to the consumer pure nicotine is only available to laboratories and suppliers who dilute and distribute it to companies like like mine as a manufacturer myself and many others work with nicotine at 10 concentration or 100 milligram per milliliter from there it is diluted during the e-liquid manufacturing process to 0.3 0.6 1.2 etc resulting in our industry standard labeling of three milligram six milligram 12 milligram statistics about uh increases in nicotine poisoning are misleading when presented as they were on tuesday if we think back 100 years there were very few automobile accidents because there weren't very many automobiles this is very similar with e-liquid e-liquid nicotine poisonings will increase simply due to the increased availability and usage of electronic cigarettes the 3000 poisonings that was mentioned on tuesday sounds like a lot compared to a prior year number of only 1500 but it's still a very small number compared to 150 000 cosmetic poisonings 118 000 cleaning substance poisonings 100 000 analgesic poisonings or fifty thousand vitamin poisonings all reported for children under the age of six in the year of 2014. but there was also discussion about propylene glycol uh there were some incorrect where points were raised um pg is one of two carriers used in e-liquids it's commonly used at a total volume percentage of 50 to as low as 10 percent uh pg was claimed to be a skin irritant and some people are allergic to it but it is still commonly used in hand creams consumed in thousands of foods and sold over the counter as a dry mouth rinse in 1942 propylene glycol was being used as an airborne germicide in 1950 it was registered by the fda for use in hospitals as an air disinfectant it's still used in various forms of air sanitizers due to its antimicrobial properties when aerosolized the other carrier that wasn't mentioned is vegetable glycerin also known as vg it is a palm-based or renewable soy-based liquid um it's a non-toxic sugar alcohol it is also used in similar pharmaceutical and food industries that was that now on to labels um vaping is a consumer-created solution to the tobacco problem our the vaping industry has been self-regulated for the better part of a decade every day roughly one million bottles of e-liquid gets shipped across the united states from over 500 brands to almost 10 000 specialty vape stores each one has a different label each manufacturer has their best estimate at what the industry wants or will require months ahead as we are constantly aiming at a moving target early on labeling was simple just a flavor name a logo and nicotine strength as the industry matured we looked to other consumer products for guidance labels started to include more detailed ingredient lists the ratio of pg to vg and warnings we didn't see poison warnings early on since vaping wasn't widespread the people who were vaping knew what they were buying as the consumer base grew it was clear that more information should be placed on labels nicotine warnings age warnings and keep out of reach of pets warnings were added last year we saw california proposition 65 warnings appearance labels even though many companies are exempt from the requirement and many others disagree with the claims made by the state of california your time is up if you could just wrap up quickly please we have born on dates expiration dates poison control information barcodes from automated manufacturing facilities for tracking inventory and batch and lot numbers for traceability is the type too small in some cases yes labels are designed for shelf appeal do they look interesting to the consumer when viewed from the other side of the counter sometimes the logo takes up more space than it should labels are also designed for the employees so they can easily select the right product at the correct nicotine strength for the consumer we have several trade organizations both svada that i'm a member of and the american e-liquid manufacturing standards association amc has standards they publish that many of us follow svada has similar standards that we follow as well all right you your time is up um representative escar has a question thank you thank you madam speaker are these i'm right here i know yes we couldn't read them on the other day i handed out a bigger version of it so this is this is your labeling that is my labeling mr first i have to recognize you before you answer go ahead representative so my question on um the top one the 1.5 milligram up here is that the milligrams of nicotine mr firth that is milligram per milliliter correct representative escar my question then is on this particular label and the ingredients listed it does not have nicotine in the ingredients is there a reason for that mr firth it's listed under the warning portion of it it represented investigar okay so the warning portion says this product may contain nicotine but it's not have it's not listed in the ingredients is that correct mr first that is correct and representative esker thank you man i'm sure and then i'm to assume the zero milligram label is the non-nicotine label correct mr firth correct all right and so the the product that does not contain nicotine also has the warning that says this product may contain nicotine is that correct mr firth that is correct okay i can tell you why that would be great go ahead tell us why it's zero milligram it's still an adult product it's still an adult product is that okay do you want to ask for a further question representative escar and using using the word may mean yes it may contain it they look at the zero when they realize it doesn't but it's still an adult adult product okay representative blantine thank you madam chair and just to clarify these were the labels that we could not read on the bottles that we were presented with tuesday is that mr firth uh i thought mine were big enough for people to read but only one of mine got passed around but there are others that were the the typeface is very small representative geneal thank you madam chair and under the lot number um i see is there a shelf life for these i'm not sure if that was answered last tuesday or not mr firth uh there is a shelf life up to two years okay thank you representative landgraf thank you madam chair you mentioned that sometimes the the labeling the lettering is very small and hard to read i don't see anything in the bill that has a lettering size requirement mr firth there's nothing that we know of uh the beer industry is an industry that our microbrewery industry is an industry that has actual font height requirements for readability so this representative line graph thank you ma'am chair so this this bill wouldn't fix the small labeling um anyway mr first it would not one last question uh representative blindgraf thank you madam chair do you know of any products that have um dangerous for children or keep out of the reach of children or something that's on one of the amendments mr first products that aren't liquid products i'm sorry what's up i didn't quite get the question i was wondering if you are aware of any um existing products that have uh keep out of the reach of children or like to find the actual language sorry um yes keep out of the reach of children uh mr firth uh planing supplies uh no representative landgraf i meant do you know of any of these uh vapor products the vapor products that say that mr firth oh from other manufacturers yes hundreds and hundreds of them okay thank you representative ransom thank you madam chair i have a question about the labeling is there any reason that it couldn't happen on a box as opposed to on the bottle that it actually comes in or are these products ever sold in a box mr firth they are sold in boxes uh which gives an opportunity for better merchandising marketing as well as giving them a lot more inch space to put more information on them but it's a trend we're seeing over the last six months any further questions right uh representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair and thank you for your testimony i'm noticing on these labels they're very colorful and they have sort of candy flavoring descriptions orange cognac liqueur or white chocolate mint but i also notice a skull and crossbones where you have indicated the phone number to the american poison control association which of the four ingredients and i'm going to list these ingredients propylene glycol vegetable glycerin natural or artificial flavors or nicotine which of those four ingredients are poisonous mr firth the poison is in the dose but nicotine nicotine okay thank you all right seeing no further questions thank you very much mr firth your testimony mike weber you could tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone thank you council representatives sorry thank you i'm the owner of an electronic cigarette store located right down downtown denver it's called mystery vapor bar we've been open since 2013. i have about five or six employees i'm also a homeowner so you guys represent me quite a lot in this state um foremost though i'm also founder of the president and president of the colorado vape association again we're a small grassroots type of organization that represents retailers and consumers across the state and are dedicated to supporting the owners employees and customers within the industry with the latest product information um safety guidelines and so forth um and just so you know cva members are you know good citizens of the state there are as we had mentioned 150 stores across the state which people are collecting uh rental space sales tax on as well as employee taxes and so forth so we do represent a significant amount of money in the state these labeling requirements from a manufacturing side just so you know a box and things like that that costs us a lot more money if we have to package it and someone puts it in that box and does that we're not big tobacco we don't have fully automated systems and things like that but just so you know we're very self-regulating we even most of the places in every brand in my store including my own private label brand are made in iso standard labs so the largest players in this industry are already using lab grade stuff because they're already consulting with the fda and applying for applications right now to meet their guidelines so there's a lot in the works but from the labeling side if i have to relabel every single label three times and then my suppliers down there bound by which states to do it i them and being impacted from a logistical standpoint on when they can get this because they'll be doing smaller supplies and so forth our customers are impacted thus my sales are impacted and your tax revenue is decreased so you know there are a lot more implications into this now since 2009 we've always been deemed that the fda will eventually regulate us and so forth but what you need to understand though is that this isn't about cessation it said in 2009 all we claim is that this is a healthier alternative to tobacco we are not a cessation product never have been last time i was here tuesday a doctor who and both the doctors that were present did not back up any of their claims of information with one study name all the studies right now are being done mostly in the uk but just now and you can look it up and i'd be happy to provide you all this information the uk just passed e-cigarettes to be allowed in hospitals right now in addition in regards to the labeling requirements just so you know a pack of cigarettes and a cigarette has over 5 000 chemicals i have yet to ever see 5 000 written articles on a pack of cigarettes why is that allowed i'm not sure but we are forthcoming with all of our information so it's part of the cva and every supplier that i've ever dealt with excuse me um already are abiding by labels regarding poisoning i'm sorry regarding poisoning labeling is not the answer that's a safety cap and all of the products in my store already have safety caps beyond that i mean parents need to take some responsibility for what they have in their house you guys have you know amended things for marijuana and kids consume edibles all day not all day but in similar packaging of that it can be in a safe locked thing and that parent leaves that brownie on the counter and guess what the kid eats it is that on the marijuana manufacturer i don't think so i think parents need to take a lot more responsibility for that stuff regards to alcohol have you guys ever had um what's that one that has um red red fire or whatever it's called um fireball excuse me fireball that has 20 to 30 percent propylene glycol in it it's called fireball and by the way when you go to argonaut people are allowed to give up free samples of liquor that's legal right now in in those places so there's a lot of things that aren't very clear on on why we're being impeded but we just like to inform you guys and educate you and i will personally i i live downtown as well supply you with all of our studies that the only ones that are legitimate right now are out of the uk not just hearsay provide you at least a good well-rounded view of our industry because there's also concern that we get tied in with marijuana as well and that's not the case one out of five people are tobacco smokers and they have nothing to do with that so we want to make sure that's also very clear mr weber your time is up can you if you just have one more sentence that's fine yeah um i would just essentially um as part of the cva and as a local business owner um oppose this bill hb 1137 it'll just create an undued cost for us it'll inhibit us ability our ability to do sales it goes all the way down the chain the fda is going to eventually mandate this anyway and they already have i would like to sit down and for something that's being you know voted on i feel be important for you guys actually read that legislation so because last meeting was clear that no one even knew that under 18 we legally can't even sell zero nicotine out of our stores and that's a law you know one that was set and it's not clear that you guys are aware of the laws that aren't even on the books but i would be very happy to sit down one-on-one and you guys can come into my store and get a second look because a one-store image is again there's very crappy marijuana dispensaries are not good and there's ones that are professional but they're you know they're in business and they need to be monitored so we are for safe products um we're for anything against anti-miners and labeling requirements but we do ask that they're fair because tobacco does not put 5000 ingredients on there we put five thank you mr webber are there questions representative vlanteen thank you madam chair and um at the very beginning you introduced yourself and said that you were president of an association the colorado go ahead mr webber colorado vape association represent valentin so are i guess i'm assuming you speak for the the vape association then yes and our members okay represent blondie so um representative klingen schmidt has a a small bottle in front of him that i'm assuming was the same one that you showed us um tuesday no i never presented anything no representative klingen schmidt did and he told us a story about a store in the in the colorado springs area that had kind of their own i don't know what you would call it they were mixing it in the back is the way he explained it is that a common practice in your industry mr rubber thank you when it first started just so you know all of these products propane glycol vegetable glycerin nicotine food flavorings and water are all federally legal you can go in the walgreens walmart anywhere you and i can all buy them that's why this is an issue no matter what because even if this whole thing gets banned and you guys put us out of business people can legally go and mix their own so this is not going to go anywhere but to answer your question i all anyone and part of my membership does not do that and everyone is moving towards all lab grade iso certified labs because they understand the ramifications and things coming down the pipeline but currently sure there are some mom and pop stores that do that i don't abide by that and within our mission statement and our requirements they're not members of my association representative lontine i i appreciate that all of those ingredients are available to anybody thank you purchase i i get that i just have a concern with that being a process for sale i mean if i want to mix up at home that's my choice but when i buy something at a store i would like to know that it's you know gone through a clean lab and there's strict standards involved so i just have concerns about the mom and pops in the back mixing it up because we have no idea what the strengths are and cleanliness and those standards so mr weber i actually completely agree um i have a manufacturing background before i ever got into this business um so i have always had even my own privately labeled brand in an iso certified lab um so i you know we i am it's it's not for me to say that other people my industry should not adhere to these standards we are all for safety and things like that within my store though all of my products are coming with all of these labels all of these requirements and everything people have said everyone in my store and our members for instance all have name a product name of strength name of all ingredients not for sale to miners warning keep out of reach of children and pets warning and the volume size so that's what's present the other thing too when it comes to poisonings i would say there's a much bigger issue to make sure which all my products do and no one is brought up but we all have see i have safety caps on every product i sell that's not mandated so that that right there will stop a kid from being able to drink the liquid and so forth and the parents sort of know they know what they're buying when they walk in our stores they come in there for consultation representative janal thank you madam chair and just a quick question about um the the vape association how many uh people and or businesses are we talking about uh mr weber um five of the ten but if you go you can go to my uh we have a facebook link page and i'll be happy to send it to you we have over about 500 to 1000 members and i'm continually adding new real content and real studies that i'd be happy to provide with you mostly out of the uk most of things we've heard here i haven't heard one you know who they're credited to by anyone even the health department and just so you know before i started my business i went to the denver health department and have recorded and asked if there was any issue with e-cigarettes before i even opened my store they looked at me and said absolutely not there's no issue with this i said are you sure they said go forth so you know there have been decisions and and the city has been collecting lots of tax for me for years now and we're for complete safety and labeling i agree i just think we should let the fda handle this so we don't incur a million other costs which are just to potentially put us out of business anyway i also would like to say that it's not very fair that tobacco again has 5 000 known chemicals in it they only list a few warnings on that but their lobbying money can do a lot we're a small we're small stores around here aiding to help people and again we are not this is not a cessation issue we're not we're not even allowed by the fda to claim cessation so that's people use that publicly but all we can say is this is a healthier alternative i'm an ex-smoker myself not smoking anything is by far the best but there's plenty of people out there that smoke marijuana too and where the studies on the health effects of that that's not being federally mandated right now but this state has given them access to do that i would just like to see fair playing grounds as well representative ryden thank you madam chair and i may have missed it but i'm looking at the fiscal note and it talks about the liquor enforcement division and how they average 2 460 tobacco inspections a year that they anticipate that this would add about five minutes per inspection and so they're not looking at any kind of increase in costs and i'm wondering do all the vape stores sell other sell tobacco products as well and or do you think that they would be more exclusive to just that the product um and would require a whole separate sort of uh inspection process mr royper um no currently vape stores only sell basically liquid nicotine our whole industry is all about getting existing smokers giving them an alternative to get off this press about miners things like that you guys have already enacted under 18 we can't even sell zero nicotine so retailers have the most to lose here worldwide it is perfectly legal to buy any of these products and at the walgreens and make it yourself so the retailers of anything are the most professional watching these things i actually had the liquor board come in this past year just sort of showed up got an a plus rating and they walked around made sure we had no 18 plus warning made sure they they're watching people id which we do we have everyone id in addition i even have one of those high-end id scanners just like marijuana does at their desk just proactively because i i do care about our constituents and our consumers so there is a lot of proactive stuff here that uh we are doing as an industry represent brighton thank you madam chair so i guess what i was trying to get at was are we going to add a a number of new locations that are not being inspected now for by the liquor enforcement division or would your store and others already be included in what in inspecting that they do mr weber um i mean i'm guess i'm not sure for every location we have we're bound to be inspected so we're just talking about the extra time for them to go to more businesses but wouldn't but i guess that what i'm confused about is don't we want further business growth in general why would why would we be concerned about them going for five minutes to inspect we have no issue with the inspections if anything they can come every week i'm not sure what you're saying representative ryden thank you madam chair i guess what i'm asking is if you're currently under tobacco laws or liquor laws and if indeed there's no additional work for them to do or have we do we have a miscalculation in our fiscal note and perhaps there would be additional costs to the government to inspect additional stores i see thank you um when he came into my store no he had a pre-list of everything that was just you have your sales tax license up there do you have nicotine products it's no different than them walking into a liquor store we're bound by the same criteria i have stuff at my my pos i have stuff at the front door we have our all of our you know trout you know insurance for employees i mean your stuff for any general business so yeah there's nothing else besides that we don't serve food um you know there's nothing we're just a retail store so yes as long as we have our fire permits we have all of our postings we have our stuff there is absolutely nothing that's added to that list that you guys currently use to inspect liquor stores and you know and everything else that abides by the same standards thank you uh represent minecraft thank you madam uh chair i just i noticed on the fiscal note that it says penalties range from a written warning up to one thousand five hundred dollar fine would that be per bottle this is probably for representatives i'm not sure mr weber could answer that but maybe represent clinton schmidt do you know thank you madam chair thank you representative landgraf and also representative briden for your questions about the fiscal note my understanding is that uh two years or before i became a legislator that senator nicholson passed a bill to make it illegal for teens and that bill when it passed probably already had a fiscal note that put in place that these products since they're now illegal for teens they need to be subject to inspection and so my understanding is those inspections are already happening the only difference with my bill is that they got to look at the label now to see if the label is accurate and i was told by the fiscal analyst yeah this is going to take an extra five minutes but they're already doing the inspections they're already at all these locations and if anything i have an inverse fiscal note where we make a little bit of money because some people if they get it wrong they might be fined so this is is a negative cost to the state if it passes represent blind graph thank you madam chair um that wasn't my question my question is the fiscal note says there is a the penalty is everything from a written warning up to a 1 500 fine so would that fine be per bottle i think we have the lifeline coming up miss berman do you want to identify yourself and see if you can answer the question thank you madam chair um yes the penalty scheme concerns sort of a step up process the first violation so the first bottle that violates you would get a warning a second violation goes up to there's a dollar amount and i can't quite remember what it is but it steps up to the fifth or sec or um subsequent violations within a two-year period would be at that hyatt that maximum fine amount so looking over a two-year period how many violations do you have and it ratchets up from there representative landgraf thank you ma'am chair i admit i've never been in one of these stores but so if if if somebody has let's say 10 bottles on a shelf of a product that isn't properly labeled and it's the first violation there'd be a warning or would it be a per bottle ms berman thank you uh let me just look quickly at the language before i answer based on the language of the bill it could be per bottle all right any further questions representative escar thank you madam chair just a clarifying question for miss berman as well i'm looking at the bill on page two line 20 and it has the statute the statute number 24 35 506 for the fines is that where the fiscal analyst was getting the up to portion of this fiscal note do you know miss berman um thank you madam chair representing vascarid i haven't looked at the fiscal note in a bit so the up to is the amount of the fines yes i would believe that's probably where the fiscal note analyst was getting that information all right any further questions and miss berman could you just tell us who you're with i don't think you actually introduced yourself thank you sorry about that jennifer berman with the office of legislative legal services thank you representative klingen schmidt thank you madam chair i don't know if there's a disconnect representative land graph but i think the people who did the fiscal note were not assuming uh fine for each bottle but a fine for for i guess each store and that's why the fiscal impact is under 500 i think if if they were finding per bottle then the fiscal note would have been a much greater profit to the state so i don't think they're reading the bill quite the same way and i don't know if the drafter would recommend any clarification uh with regards to an amendment to make sure it's not actually per bottle all right see no further questions thank you both mr rubber and ms berman and next we have david yoshikawa come on up and tell us who you are and who you're representing my name is david yoshikawa i i'm representing vaporgate myself go ahead oh just go i'm just a little curious as to why we're trying to pass this bill when everything that's been already set in motion from the federal government to do essentially the same thing um it doesn't make a lot of sense to have to change our labels for this and then in addition to do it for the federal government because we have to have a particular uh wordage i think all the manufacturers have already prepared themselves to um to change the labels once it's required but to do it again to do it this time and then to do it one time further just seems a little redundant i think that we all are in support of labels and we all want them but we're waiting for something that's standardized where uh it's a it's nationwide and it's not per state to have requirements per state is going to put a big hurt on the production cost of our manufacturing and it's going to cause logistically a quite a big issue all right thank you um mr yoshikawa are there questions representative primavera thank you madam chair um in reference to the fda um i've i've heard that what they're doing is purely speculative right now maybe you have better information than i do and um it could take years for them to actually do something about this and i'm not sure labeling is even part of what they're looking at do you have better information than i have mr yoshikawa i'm pretty positive that it actually includes labeling um one thing that is actually going to be part of like the whole regulation is with smaller companies that don't produce in a certified lab environment they're going to have requirements for them or they're not going to be able to make it at all and they're going to be forced to actually source to a production facility that is certified that is it has a clean room in a lab where they can actually have a more controlled environment and have the required wordage and information and warnings particular to the product any further questions representative primavera man i'm sure but you don't know this all for sure do you mr yoshikawa no because it hasn't been released since you know what we're doing is we're waiting on it i would love to know exactly where i stand and what's going to happen and it's right down the pipes but to pass something and then to have the federal one pass shortly thereafter it's kind of silly i think all right see no further questions thank you so much for your testimony today and uh mr croom i think it is [Music] if you want to come up and tell us who you are and who you're representing today i don't need these to know who i am but i need them my name is wilson croom i'm president of the colorado association of distributors our members provide products to convenience stores everything except for the beer coat and direct store delivery products and it does include tobacco and nicotine products first i'd like to mention since it came up on tuesday the accidental use by child or consumption by a child on january the 28th the president signed a bill requiring nicotine products to be packaged child proof that'll be effective in july 180 days neither cad or its members or anyone i know in the industry opposes labeling of products containing nicotine we supported inclusion of nicotine items for prohibition to underage sales this bill creates a labeling requirement that will be resolved by fda while the timing of fda action is not certain it could be prior to the effective date of this bill or shortly after when the fda establishes these requirements they will be consistent nationwide while this bill causes all product not labeled as call for in this bill to be unsalable on january 1 2017. the fda requirements will allow phase in period distributors and relayers would be able to sell product this would create a burden for wholesalers and retailers because it's highly unlikely that you could run your inventory to zero on december 31 of 2016. so whatever product they held at that time would be a complete loss to the business because it couldn't be sold it's not likely that manufacturers could justify unique labeling just for colorado and if this if this becomes effective before the fda action and this would create a situation where they didn't produce product that could be sold to and by colorado businesses the affected product is legal in colorado and there is a consumer demand if an environment created is created whether it was not available here by the retail community they could turn to the internet across state lines or illegitimate operators to acquire the product at a cost to the state and law-abiding retailers and wholesalers regarding enforcement we currently have a huge problem with operators selling out of the bounds or back of the trunks of their cars tobacco products that no tax is collected on we've tried a number of times to work with the revenue department to find a way to resolve this because it's costly to us as business people and there's not been success with that so these same dealers would not be reluctant to sell an unlabeled product containing nicotine and i don't think they'd be concerned with age limits thank you all right thank you very much mr croom are there questions for this witness representative ryden thank you madam chair and i maybe should have asked this sooner of the one of the vape shop owners but is it your experience that um from the distributor side that a shop would purchase like a year's supply or would it be like a month-to-month sort of situation mr crew that's difficult to save representative riding because if you try to maintain an inventory level that you can satisfy your customers needs up to a given point uh you could have one product you may have three months supply of one you may run out from three or four days if you can sell it but it'll be i mean it's just the art of inventory management it's not so fine that you could say all right this is all i'll sell through january 30 i mean december 31st so i mean it's hard to put a number on that but it it'd be impossible to not wind up having to throw away a lot of product all right see no other questions thank you very much for your testimony thank you we ask you a no vote so members of the committee um we have patrick maroney i don't know if he's here today but he's here for questions only he works for liquor enforcement for the state so does anyone have questions for liquor enforcement that's a good question so the question is do they enforce this well i don't think we have we don't have it yet so but it's probably well that's a good question i don't know is mr maroney here i don't think he's here so never mind um all right we have um a question for the drafter did she leave jennifer i can't see her she's behind the pole there you are you want to come back up and tell us again who you are and who you're representing thank you madam chair jennifer berman office of legislative legal services i think representative eskar has a question for you thank you madam chair i actually have just one or two okay and this may be for you or for the fiscal analyst so going back again when we were discussing the limitations on fines on line 20 of page two the fiscal note says it could be fines up to fifteen hundred dollars where in fact statue it says a fine of between one thousand dollars and fifteen thousand dollars for a fifth or sub subsequent violation within a 24 month period and my question is is it really up to fifteen thousand dollars for a a fifth sub subsequent violation and to that question is a violation one bottle without the right label is it one visit to a store what what is a violation and how do they acquire how many miss berman thank you madam chair representative veskar um the statute does state in section 24 35 506 which concerns the penalties that a fifth or subsequent violation in a two-year period could get the minimum of a one thousand dollar fine up to the maximum of a fifteen thousand dollar fine and as drafted the unit of the violation might be the best way to look at this is the is a packaged nicotine product which could mean that multiple packaged nicotine products in one place that do not have this warning label could each be viewed as a single independent violation of each other they could be viewed as multiple violations whether that's how it would be enforced that i don't know uh representative escar thank you madam chair so just to clarify that i'm hearing you correctly the way the bill's drafted if a store was selling a product that didn't have the correct label that this bill states and they had over five products that day they can get slapped with a fifteen thousand dollar fine miss berman thank you madam chair i think that's possible i guess uh we also have our fiscal analyst president does anyone have a question for miss paramook i guess not you get off easy by the way it does appear that the liquor enforcement division would be the agency and the department of revenue that would be enforcing this bill if it is passed all right that concludes all the witnesses who have signed up to testify with respect to this case or i mean this bill are there any other witnesses in the audience that would like to testify regarding this bill seeing none the testimony phase is closing oh come on up representative clinton schmidt we have a witness that would like to testify so why don't you come back and make sure you hear what he has to say do you want to tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone hi my name is justice bernal and i'm a curious uh high school senior at po west high school at which high school of pueblo west oh well thank you for coming all the way from pueblo you have your representative here i believe i don't know if you live in that district but your school's in her district um all right go ahead um i just have one question for senator christman and uh another question for one of the business owners well you're not really allowed to ask questions terrible um until you get elected up here and come up here how long will that take [Laughter] i think you have to be 25 so you're probably what 17 or 18 or 16 seven years so we'll see you back up here no but seriously if you um want to make a statement you can tell us what your questions are and then maybe someone else will ask them of representative klingenschmidt well i was just wondering what the economic detriment would be on the small business side or if there would be any economic detriment at all for the relabeling of all the e-liquids or if it was just a nuisance to the actual small business the mom and pops and what they'll say would be doing okay i think that's something we'll probably be taking into consideration when we vote on it several of the business owners indicated i think that it would have an economic impact on their businesses do you have any other comments um i was wondering on if there was any evidence or studies on either goods specifically whether or not there would be an effective deterrent with a warning label with a warning that will be an effective deterrent specifically to the e-liquids representative escort has an opinion thank you madam chair and actually i have a question for you on that then as as a teenager does a warning label on any product deter you from using a product um i've never used a product but if i did i don't think i'd be inclined to read the side of the label now okay representative janal thank you for being here and um being brave enough to come up and and talk to us all i just wondered um being a high school student uh do you see this and on yeah within the um high school mr ott um i haven't seen it within my own high school but i do have a family member who is one of the small mom and pops so i was wondering if the economic detriment would be grand enough to shut him down because he used to smoke two packs a day and now he doesn't smoke cigarettes at all and now he has a steady income any further questions representative geneal just a clarification on the students what percentage would you say are using vape cigarettes in my high school mr ott one percent okay probably less thank you thank you very much for coming up and participating and yeah um mr before you leave we have some sign up sheets in the back we need you to sign up as a witness all right thank you very much all right that concludes well is there anyone else that wants to testify any other students looks like we have a lot of you here all right um that will conclude the testimony phase of the hearing representative klingenschmidt or anyone else are there any amendments to discuss regarding the spill yes ma'am there are amendments um i have prepared and i think were distributed several days ago amendments two three and four and i'm just been made aware of amendment zero zero five and i believe the drafter is working on zero zero six which will hopefully resolve the question of representative landgrass and eskars about multiple bottles versus one violation so again our goal and i'm asking the drafter to bring this amendment that she's working on right now and she showed me a handwritten version of it that would say we're not going to let's let's wait till we get that amendment and let's go ahead and talk about the other amendments do you want to move l02 yes ma'am i well there's probably some discussion because we need to resolve the differences between l002 and l005 why don't you go ahead and move l002 because i believe l05 is a substitute to it so we'll discuss them both once both of them are moved thank you madam chair therefore i move amendment l002 and is there a second oh second okay representative brown seconded all right and there's a substitute to l002 representative ryden thank you madam chair and i move l005 as a substitute amendment to l002 is there a second second second by representative genoal all right representative klingenschmidt tell us does everyone have a copy of l02 and 0 0 5. okay tell us about l 0 0 2 and i know you haven't had much chance to look at the substitute but representative ryden can tell us about her substitute thank you madam chair actually five looks like what i started with when i was drafting l zero zero two and the reason we didn't end up with a repeal version is because and we ended up with the l zero zero two version which i think is better is for two reasons number one the department and the counties were in the room with me when we drafted l zero zero two and i believe they told me they support this version of the language that is federally mandated or the following or comparable language and that gives maximum flexibility to retailers we don't want them out in no man's land and we don't want them with two conflicting rules and so i'm concerned and i'll wait till representative ryden uh introduces or talks about l05 before i uh oppose it but when we can when we were considering doing a repeal version we went against that because there could be if we did a repeal version this strange instance where the feds come out with a rule but we already have the colorado rule but it it's not exactly the same and therefore we'd have a double rule and i want to avoid that and so we came up with the ver the flexible language in l002 where it says either or and i think either or would prevent these retailers from going in no man's land where we have a state law and then we have a different federal law that that does not preempt or does preempt and we end up with two different laws the either or language allows them flexibility and i think it would cede or give way to federal language most of the retailers i think would choose federal language since they're selling across state lines but without that flexibility then the retailers could be in a bind and therefore we provided the maximum flexibility in l02 notice also in lines 10 through 13 we're exempting for example nicotine gum or products that the fda has labeled as legitimate tobacco cessation products all right thank you representative clinton schmidt representative ryden do you want to tell us about l005 thank you madam chair well i think l05 really clarifies that when the federal government does act it will supersede what we have and we will repeal the language that we that's in this bill and i believe that that is really what will happen and i want to make it just wanted to make that clear that we wouldn't have two parallel systems going on at the same time which i don't even think would be legal all right are there questions about the amendments representative janal thank you madam chair and representative clinton clinton it's my understanding what i heard from some of the people coming to testify today that the president just signed a something that would in 90 days uh put a warning on uh tobacco products no it's uh for the safety caps it's for the safety caps the way i understood it but representative clinton do you know madam chair you're correct uh representative janal your statement is incorrect in 90 days what's going to be required are child proof caps and even if they have child proof caps on nicotine products there's still no federal warning label requirement even in 90 days that has not been signed by the president that has not even been authorized as a rule in fact the current rulemaking decision process has not even decided if they have federal authority to make any warning labels whatsoever so the apples and oranges represent valentin thank you madam chair um i'm wondering the california language i hate to be coming back to that but it seems like that's such a large market and they're already our large manufacturers complying with that although it's under their proposition 65 but would um would their labeling suggestions fall under the comparable language language and and and does the california labeling include anything about addictions and keeping out our reach of kids representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair thank you representative lantine i haven't read the california law but i have read all the bottles that were presented to me as having been manufactured in california and they all did use the word addictive and i think that is comparable language to what would be proposed here in colorado so i think i have yet to see a bottle in this room or anywhere uh maybe with the exception of the one that i bought in colorado springs uh that that has some attempt at these warning labels that would not be comparable language i'm trying to provide the maximum flexibility when i use that word comparable language and i think that's a pretty low bar for a legal standard if someone's going to go into court and say well you know our language has these 10 words and maybe they're not even close to the same as my four words they're still comparable i think that's a pretty loose standard [Music] representative lontine thank you madam chair i was just curious if the attorney who testified on behalf of the industry was still here she could comment on that she is here ms york do you want to come up we'll allow testimony on that question about the prop 65 question ms york you introduce yourself again please uh my name is catherine york i'm the a co-chair of the safada right i'm from colorado and i'm sorry prop 65 only addresses the it does nothing to do with addictiveness of nicotine it has nothing to do with nicotine in general nicotine is just one of many chemicals that the prop 65 warning applies to nicotine specifically is a chemical where you have to put a warning that says this product contains nicotine a product known by the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm that that's all you have to put to satisfy that requirement for nicotine it has nothing to do with addictiveness and um as we discussed during my testimony earlier some products do not say that nicotine is addictive because there is dispute within our industry about whether or not it independently is as addictive as other tobacco products and so until the fda regulations come out it is unlikely that manufacturers will all independently adopt a warning that says nicotine is addictive and uh representative clinton schmidt said that unless it says addictive it's not comparable and i believe comparable actually is kind of ambiguous and that creates some uncertainty for retailers because they have to judge whether or not it's comparable and that puts retailers in the awkward position of now making a legal decision that could cost them 15 000 on a bad day so i'm sorry but comparable is not the perfect standard either even if it's intended to be flexible flexible is not always great as a legal standard thank you i represent primavera thank you madam chair and this is probably a question for representative ryden who had this l005 drawn up what we saw yesterday or whatever day we met in committee were the warning labels labels were so little that but they still weren't legible and this amendment says uh the following or comparable language is conspicuously placed on the package in a warning label i think they were conspicuously placed but i still couldn't read them because the font was so small so i was wondering about a conceptual amendment to say something about a warning label that is readable or something like that um miss york no this is for representative i'm sorry representative bryden thank you madam chair i would not object to such a conceptual amendment although it does concern me that if we start specifying type size we would be putting our our small business is sort of in the same position that they're talking about now in terms of having to change it for a specific state it that does concern me all right um is there any other yes you may leave thank you miss york are there any other comments on l zero zero two or l zero zero five we'll we'll be voting on l zero zero five first um [Music] so any further comments on l005 representative klingenschmidt i presume that you are opposed to l005 am i correct yes madam chair i'm opposed to l005 and if i could draw everyone's attention on l005 there are lines 14 and 15 which are never going to happen and i'll tell you why if there's going to be a federally mandated warning label for nicotine products it's not going to say that do not contain tobacco because remember we discussed that colorado statute has nicotine or tobacco and colorado law considers nicotine as not tobacco but federal rules are labeled that nicotine is derived from tobacco so when the federal rules come out they will describe nicotine that is derived from tobacco they will never make a federal rule that describes a nicotine product that does not contain tobacco and so that will cause this double law where we have a state law if my bill passes and then we have a different federal label that is mandated by a federal rule but it doesn't trigger this repeal because the federal rule will say there has to be a label but it won't use these words and so it will not actually trigger a repeal of the colorado law and we'll end up with two laws if l005 is adopted and that's why we we considered doing it this way but ultimately the drafter and and the department and the counties we're all in the same room together we decided to create more flexibility to make sure that whatever the federal rules are we don't run into a problem with preemption and therefore we came up with l002 which avoids the preemption problem all right are there any further comments so um what we're going to do is we will ask if there is i will ask if there's an objection to the substitute l05 which is a substitute to l002 if there's objection we'll vote on that substitute uh if if it passes then it becomes part of l002 which we will then vote on it replaces l002 so we don't need to vote on l002 if it doesn't pass then we'll go back and vote on l002 any questions lots of confused looks so we're going first of all let me ask is there an objection to l05 which is the substitute to l zero zero two there is an objection so we're going to vote and representative escar has a confused look on her face so let's see what she has to question my question is before we vote on l005 is what representative klingenschmidt just said factual because that i think does mess up the intent of what we're trying to do with l05 so here's my suggestion because i don't think we really know precisely the impact of l05 i'm planning to vote no because i think if we will and go ahead with l02 and then if we find out more information there can be a second reading amendment if we if this bill passes because i have some concerns myself about what l zero zero five um what impact it has and i want to make sure before we vote on that that we have a clearer understanding of what the federal government might or might not do and i don't think we really know for sure so that's what that's what i'm going to do um i don't know if representative ryden or representative clinton schmidt have any further comments representative ryden thank you man i'm terrible i i i just have a disagreement with representative klingenschmidt on this matter and after speaking with a drafter that's why i presented amendment l005 so folks can make up their own mind about it all right there is objection so now we will vote on l zero zero five and again if this passes then it amends the bill and we don't vote on l zero zero two if it doesn't pass then we'll go back and vote on l zero zero two all right miss king could you call the role representative brown no representative buckner no representative esgar pass representative humphrey i'll go with a drafter yes representative joshie no represent klingon schmidt no representative landgraf i'm going to go with humphrey and say yes representative blanteen yes representative primavera yes representative ransom yes representative ryden yes representative esgar because i know the drafter is smarter than me yes representative janal um because of the drafter yes madam chair no so that amendment passes eight to five so uh that will supersede amendment l zero zero two so let's move on to l zero zero four or three sorry representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair um i move l003 and is there a second second who seconded it uh representative vlantee all right um tell us about l003 thank you madam chair this amendment was brought to me by uh children's hospital and national jewish health and their concern and i was neutral on this amendment actually until a few minutes ago when one of the uh opponents of the bill came up and handed this out this orange label that has skull and crossbones i mean mr yuck stickers right and they they have the poison control center right on their and they told me what nicotine is a poison and i didn't really think of it in those terms until they really explained that but now i think it's essential that we keep this out of the hands of children this these products are labeled like bubble gum or like cherry or banana flavor it's intended for human consumption in some way although it may have a child proof cap i think it's still imperative and i agree with uh the children's and health advocates that say this should be kept out of the reach of children it puts that extra thought in legal adult buyers of these substances that you know we ought to protect our children at least by giving them the information that it might be dangerous so i i'm in support of l03 are there any questions is there any objection to l03 seeing none l03 will be adopted all right tell us now about l004 thank you madam chair i move l004 thank you is there a second okay second by representative humphrey now you can tell us about l04 thank you madam chair l004 again tries to deconflict with federal definitions of what a tobacco product is because the fda is already label requiring labels on tobacco products but not yet on nicotine products and so the department in fact insisted and prodded me to where i finally caved in and brought this amendment to say that instead of just requiring a label on any product that is contains nicotine that is not a tobacco product that we specify which kinds of tobacco products so the following tobacco products are described in federal rules and that includes cigarettes cigarette tobacco roll urine tobacco and smokers tobacco as those terms are defined in the tobacco control act so this helps align with federal law when you're talking about what is tobacco well these four kinds of products are defined as tobacco and federal law and so this removes ambiguity from the colorado version so i urge a yes vote on l04 are there any questions i think you invented a new word deconflict deconflict well anyway is there any objection to l004 seeing none l004 will be adopted now we have l006 which just arrived so can you tell us is do you want to move l06 thank you madam chair i move l006 is there a second second second by representative gennall tell us about l006 thank you madam chair we just drafted this on the fly in response to representative landgraf's and the drafter confirmed that without this amendment there could be ambiguity if a retailer has a hundred bottles for sale does that mean they get fined a hundred times in one visit well this amendment would fix that and say no no no that's not what we mean we're not trying to find them a hundred times in one visit this would limit it to a single store a single visit even if they have a hundred bottles they only get one morning they get one fine and not a hundred fines at the same time so i am intending to resolve the discrepancies properly identified by representatives escar and land graph and i support this solution to what i think is the problem they articulated and therefore i support l06 are there any uh questions regarding l006 is there any objection to l06 seeing no objection that amendment is adopted are there any further amendments by representative klingenschmidt or other members of the committee seeing none the amendment phase is closed and we are now ready for action on the bill representative klingenschmidt would you like to move the bill thank you madam chair this is an exciting moment for me i move house bill 16-1137 to the committee of the whole with a favorable recommendation as amended all right is there a second second representative on teen second um would well are there any comments from members of the committee and then we'll give representative clinton schmidt an opportunity to wrap up representative landgraf thank you madam chair um i know that my name is on this bill but after careful consideration of all the facts um i'm sorry but i'll be a no and obviously i will be asking to have my name removed if the bill goes forward representative humphrey thank you madam chair um and thank you representative clinton schmidt for the bill i appreciate what you're trying to do here and and we certainly don't want kids um um you know getting into this stuff but uh i you know i i like to think in terms of personal responsibility with the parents uh this can't be well shouldn't be sold to the kids that's illegal um and i just think that this is uh you know a stop gap measure that's going to be a uh could really be a stop business measure from what we've heard from business owners you know regardless of what you know we might think about the product it's a it's a legal product um so i'm just you know i'm i'm i'm thinking within the next matter of months that there's going to be federal regulations so i'll have to be a no vote for today all right other comments representative vescar thank you madam chair and at first glance of this bill i was supportive of it and the more we've been digging into it and the more i'm finding out that the federal regulations are supposed to come down very soon knowing that there's already many warning labels on many of the products that are being sold i just i i'm afraid that this is going to cause a lot of conflict for small businesses specifically in my constituency and across colorado honestly and i do believe that these products need to be regulated i do believe these products need to be able to warn people that there is nicotine in them and that there is a poison in them i just am afraid that this bill right now is just going to cause more harm than good when the feds are supposed to bring down the sentence so i respect the idea i want to protect children as much as you do i just don't know if this bill is the best policy for all of colorado right now representative brydon thank you madam chair and i was sitting here listening to the testimony and thinking about my own history with my own son who you know has managed to get to 37 and is thriving and is doing well but when he was two he got into a box of salt well we all know that nacl is a poison and if you eat too much salt you can die and yet i don't believe there's labeling on the box that says keep out of the reach of children or dangerous poison inside so i have also been hearing from our small businesses and it just i remember back too when the way before we were in the legislature that a bill was passed that outlawed smoking in public places and one of the places that was hurt the most were the small little corner bars where people came to their neighborhood bar and they smoked and they drank and there was as i recall virtually no timeline on that new law and a whole lot of people went out of business and it just i agree with representative escar it just feels as if this is going to do maybe more harm than good and i do believe that certainly we should watch for the federal government to act and if they don't then perhaps we should bring this back again but for right now it just feels like we're really putting the squeeze on our small businesses not giving them enough time to really comply they're going to have product on their shelves that they're going to have to just get rid of um it just i don't know it just doesn't feel like it's something that we should be doing at this moment in time and so i am a no vote also today president buckner thank you madam chair um thank you mr klingel's representative klingel schmidt for bringing this to our attention i think your intentions were valiant your intentions are fantastic however as much as i respect all the testimony from the hospitals and i have a fond affection for all the hospitals in colorado i'm really concerned about the federal regulation that's coming down and also i'm even concerned there if there's not much there's no regulation basically on edibles and there are so many more edibles available than vapes i don't quite understand so i can't vote for this right now but your intentions are amazing and i talked to my daughter and my son and they all have children and i asked them what they thought about the labeling and i know we all try to be super conscious i know i did as a young mother and even as an older mother but sometimes unfortunately kids get into things hopefully this won't happen with this particular product but i don't think the timing is good right now for small businesses and i'm going to wait for the feds to come down so i'm going to have to vote no representative gennall thank you madam chair and thank you representative clinton schmidt for bringing this bill forward i think it's opened our eyes to uh an issue that we'll be watching and i know you and i sat down and talked about this and um at at the time i thought it was an excellent idea um and i thought it was needed for for the safety purposes and for the health purposes but hearing the testimony today i guess kind of made me think differently about this bill if we had voted on tuesday it might be a different outcome but hearing the small businesses and the business owners talk about how they would lose sales and consequently it may affect their business even more i do have concerns and if the fda is going to come out with something in the near future i think that that would be a better route to grow to go and the and the other thing that that made me question this is when i asked the young high school student that is representative eskars um uh in her in pueblo uh he um he he said that he was concerned with his family small business and and that for a young man to be concerned and come up and question that i'm glad you asked that question and also when i asked how many of the students in that high school does he think uh did vapor cigarettes uh he gave me a one percent amount so it's not that i don't care about the health issues but i do hear the small businesses and i think this that this will affect them greatly and when the fda does come out hopefully soon i hope that will remedy this issue so respectfully representative klingerschmidt i will be a no today all right any further comments representative klingenschmidt do you want to wrap up thank you madam chair i was hoping to wrap up before everybody said they were no i could have persuaded you with i had a killer closing speech i knew i could have gotten all of you you haven't voted but uh i haven't voted yet so you persuade them thank you madam chair i am concerned again we have products here that look like candy and this bottle doesn't even say nicotine on the bottle and adding four words that nicotine is an addictive substance uh that that nicotine is in the bottle at least you got to list it as an ingredient i think that's common sense not only that my bill would fix a truth in labeling error we've seen deceptive labels the health community is about that and by the way i believe in personal responsibility i believe in parental responsibility even teenagers ought to be taught read what's in the bottle before you put it in your body the problem is when they try to do that there's nothing on the label there's nothing to read if you're a parent and you're trying to protect your teen and you and you're careful and you read the labels but the labels are blank or deceptive then how can a parent take responsibility so i think there are conflicting principles at play here and i think we're enhancing a parent or a teen's ability to be personally responsible when we simply tell them what's inside the bottle i have talked to retailers who say they want guidance i don't believe federal guidance is coming in the next 90 days i don't think it's coming in the next year if it does that's fine as the bill is amended this would be repealed my bill is supported by the department and thank you for their help today my bill is supported and was initiated by the counties and i so grateful to have their support today and the doctors and the child advocates are all in favor of truth in labeling this is not an anti-liberty bill it's not hard for a business owner to put a sticker on a label in fact the responsible ones are already doing that and they're already using comparable language and so my bill would would narrowly bring into line those rogue elements in the industry that are mixing whatever in their kitchen and not telling people what they're putting in their bodies and i think that's needed colorado needs clarity the retailers need clarity the parents and children need clarity the hospitals need clarity there is no clarity and i don't think the feds are coming with it anytime soon and even if they do uh even representative ryden's amendment which passed would would fix that so i don't see the logic behind the opposition i'm still asking for a yes vote and hopefully my closing words have at least impacted if not changed a few hearts here thank you ma'am thank you and um represent clinton schmidt i'm going to be a yes vote on your bill um because i do think that it sounds like the federal regulations are not coming in if they do it'll still be a two-year period and then if there's a lawsuit it could be five or six years or more before we have any kind of federal guidance and um i do think it sounds as though many of the manufacturers are already putting labels on these bottles that contain warnings and contain the reference to nicotine um i think that they will be able to make the adjustment the bill doesn't go into effect till january 1 of 2017 so there is some time for um compliance with the regulate the bill if it passes so i will be supporting the bill today and uh miss king would you like to call the role um representative brown respectfully no representative buckner respectfully no representative representative humphrey nope representative joshi no representative clinging schmidt yes representative graf no representative vlanteen i can't believe i'm saying this representative klingen schmidt but yes representative primavera yes representative ransom representative ryden representative esgar respectfully no representative geneal respectfully no madam chair yes uh representative clinton schmidt that fails on a vote of nine to four oh is there another motion regarding this bill representative landgraf i move to pi the bill set the motion if you like to make it that would be an appropriate motion is there a second to pi the bill a second second second by representative ryden um miss king could you take the role representative brown yes representative buckner yes representative esgar yes representative humphrey representative joshi yes representative clinton schmidt no representative landgraf yes representative vlanteen yes representative primavera yes representative ransom representative ryden yes representative yes madam chair yes that passes on a vote of 12 to 1. all right thank you very much uh representative clinton schmidt and we are now ready to hear bill 1113 representative humphrey thank you to all of you who sat so patiently through this bill and we will now move to the next bill doesn't matter to me bring me all the kisses you can yeah when is it eight to eight to four are you ready representative humphrey almost almost all right no problem next time we'll be co-praying oh i forgot you won't be here cause then he just said this i guess all right representative humphrey you ready to proceed with house bill 1137 i'm sorry 1113. i am thank you madam chair um i was forgetting that i had a bill up there for a minute it's been a long day already no it's going to be like order pizza time eventually here if we take too long so um house bill 16113 a bill for an act concerning the protection of human life beginning at conception um i don't i don't think that we could totally deconflict the room uh over this bill as uh klingen schmidt uh representative clinton schmidt is that a triple word score for you deconflict nice um so i do a little bit more in introduction for this bill because it it kind of requires a little bit ex explanation so um i appreciate everybody being here to to listen and i will i will try to uh modulate my voice a little bit so this isn't too monotone so um i'll summarize what the bill does at the end um and just sort of get into the the uh the spirit of it and the philosophy of it here first the heart of this bill is the moral conviction and scientific evidence for the fact that life begins a conception the facts of science are clear from the earliest stages of development the unborn are distinct living and whole human beings therefore every successful quote-unquote abortion ends the life of a living human being according to ruse and schwarzwalder of the family research council the classic pro-abortion arguments arguments that no one knows when life begins and that a fetus is a blob of tissue are being crushed by the weight of science they write that at the moment when a human sperm penetrates the human ovum or egg generally in the upper portion of the fallopian tube a new entity comes into existence the zygote is the name of the first cell formed at conception the earliest developmental stage of the human embryo followed by the morula and blastocyst stages is it human is it alive is it just a cell or is it an actual organism a being the zygote is composed of human dna and other human molecules so its nature is undeniably human and not some other species the new human zygote has a genetic composition that is absolutely unique to itself different from any other human that has ever existed including that of its mother [Music] this dna includes a complete design guiding not only early development but even hereditary attributes that will appear in childhood and adulthood from hair and eye color to personality traits it is also quite clear that the earliest human embryo is biologically alive it fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life metabolism growth reaction to stimuli and reproduction finally is the human zygote merely a new kind of cell or is it a human organism that is a human being scientists define an organism as a complex structure of interdependent elements constituted to carry on the activities of life by separately functioning but mutually dependent organs the human zygote meets this definition with ease once formed it initiates a complex sequence of events to ready it for continued development and growth the zygote acts immediately and decisively to initiate a program of development that will if uninterrupted by accident disease or external intervention proceeds seamlessly through formation of the definitive body birth childhood adolescence maturity through aging ending with death this coordinated behavior is a very hallmark of an organism by contrast while a mere collection of human cells may carry on the activities of cellular life it will not exhibit coordinated interactions directed towards a higher level of organization thus the scientific evidence is quite plain at the moment of fusion of human sperm and egg the new entity comes into existence which is distinctly human alive and an individual organism a living and fully human being some defenders of abortion concede the scientific proofs but will argue that the entity in the womb is not or not yet a person not a person is a decidedly unscientific argument it has nothing to do with science everything to do with someone's own moral or political philosophy though that someone may not readily admit it where either persons or property and even the staunchest abortion defender will be reluctant to call a human child a piece of property so again i appreciate everybody being here to listen i know this is like a highly emotional issue and um you know i think that we can have a a civil discussion on this um and what i see is is that the key question is that is it possible to the opponents is it possible that abortion kills an innocent human being and i'd urge those listening to have an open mind it's surprising how many people have never really heard um you know coherent pro-life argument before the foundational question is this what is the unborn say you're working in the garden and a child says from behind you can i kill this a five-year-old can ask that kind of question um and many others the kid has your attention right so you turn see what we're talking about is it a slimy worm um or a sibling before you would say yes or no we would have very different reactions in either case if it was a cockroach you might say yeah so well no we we need those in the garden in the soil we like those and if it's a little brother or sister in a headlock you would say you know no definitely not kiddo and you might have a conversation with the youngster about that question you have to know what it is first to know whether or not it's moral to kill it cockroach um or worm or sibling what is being killed if the unborn is not a human being no justification for abortion is necessary however if the unborn is a human being no justification for abortion is adequate but truth is if the unborn is an unviable tissue mass a part of the mother's body a potential human then no special justification for abortion is necessary no problem no need for all kinds of justifications and arguments however if the unborn is a human being everything changes because abortion kills an innocent human being so the first claim i would make would be that abortion or that the first claim would be that it's wrong to intentionally kill an innocent human being second claim abortion intentionally kills an innocent unborn human being the conclusion is abortion intentionally kills an innocent human being therefore abortion is wrong that's the basic moral logic of the pro-life cause [Music] we can all agree i think it's safe to say that taking an innocent human life is an injustice and i think we can also agree that the unborn is a unique individual living living human being for her entire life you see the unborn is a living living being from the moment of conception we know that the unborn is alive from conception there is no period of non-life in the sequence from conception to birth there is an unbroken continuum of life from living sperm and living egg to living zygote to bastula and so on through three trimesters to birth and toddlerhood childhood adolescence to living adults we know that the zygote is alive because the zygote is growing biologically biological growth begins at conception this proves the unborn is a lie there's no period of non-life that life springs from no spontaneous generation the zygote possesses all of the biological criteria for life metabolism growth reproduction a reaction to stimuli so the unborn is clearly a lie from conception the unborn's body is not the mother's body from the moment of conception the unborn has a separate brain a nervous system can be a different gender have a different blood type etc they're not all distinct from the mother not only this but the unborn has her own genetic fingerprint one's fingerprint is the makeup of one's genetic fingerprint is the makeup of genetic chromosomes that is totally unique to that person the mother contributes 23 living chromosomes a father contributes 23 living chromosomes egg and sperm unite creating a brand new unique living being i'm trying to cut down a little bit on my comments here for time um the unborn is a human being from the moment of conception the kind of being that the unborn is is a human being for her entire life she's not partially human she is not potentially human she is not possibly human she is a complete human being as long as she is alive now her body may take many forms along the way during her life her body will pass through numerous stages of development but she will always be the same thing a human being until she dies each of us is a unique human being each of us as unique human beings came into existence at conception the unborn genetic dna signature proves that she is a human being because every living being has a unique kind of dna not only can we distinguish one human from another through dna analysis but we can distinguish completely different kinds of beings fish lizard human so you can test the human zygote and see that it has a human genetic signature in its dna and it is the information in that dna that will cause the self-integrated system to develop through all the human developmental stages on the way to being a fetus a newborn a child and so on as the human being develops from zygote to fetus over a matter of weeks it eventually begins to look more human to our eyes but like different types of animals they don't become different kinds of animals as they move through developmental stages living beings develop based on certain developmental progression based on the kind of creature they already are the various human developmental forms develop out of this newly conceived human being not the other way around you don't have these different forms that then develop at some point into a human being but rather it takes the forms that it takes in its development because the thing is already a human being from the beginning when does the unborn become a member of the human race when she becomes a distinct living being and that happens at the moment of conception a human being becomes a being at conception and the unborn will continue to be that through development and throughout life until the day she dies so the unborn is alive and there is no period of non-life second the unborn is a separate individual living being third the unborn is a complete human being from conception so um house bill 13 1033 prohibits abortion and makes any violation a felony the following are exceptions to the prohibition of abortion in the bill a licensed physician who performs a medical procedure designed or intended to prevent the life to prevent the death of a pregnant mother if the physician makes a reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve both the life of the mother and the life of the unborn child in a manner consistent with conventional medical practice and an exception for when a licensed physician provides medical treatment to the mother that results in the accidental or unintentional injury or death of the unborn child please note that the pregnant mother upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted is not subject to a criminal penalty the sale and use of contraception is not prohibited by the bill and a conviction related to the abortion prohibition constitutes unprofessional conduct for purposes of physician licensing so at that point i'm ready for questions from the committee thank you representative humphrey are there questions from the committee representative primavera thank you madam chair did you say hospital 1033 because i have 11 13. oh you're you're correct i read that that was a that was a pass you're correct yeah 11 13. any further questions for the sponsor representative vlanteen thank you madam chair i was just curious representative humphrey um do you know the definition of an ectopic pregnancy representative humphrey um i i do do you have a question concerning ectopic pregnancies representative vlanteen um well i was just wondering on page four line two you make a a reference to a physician making reasonable medical efforts to preserve both the life of the mother um an ectopic pregnancy is not viable due to it not being and according to the definition developing outside the uterus so the removal of that pregnancy would be i guess in violation of your bill so i ectopic pregnancies are generally life-threatening i wondered if you'd considered that represent humphrey um thank you madam chair and thank you for the the question representative lontine um i i believe that the way that the the drafter composed this the assumption would be that um making a reasonable medical effort to preserve both um would would be consistent because there isn't any reasonable medical way to preserve that life when you're trying to save the life of the mother in that situation so it would not it would not preclude that or require that the the doctor be prosecuted also the bill says that there has to be a specific intent to terminate the life of the unborn child and that would not that would not be the specific intent it would be actually to save the life of the mother in that case any further questions representative geneal thank you madam chair and thank you representative humphrey um i had a question on your definitions in regards to um pregnancy and just uh why are you changing that definition from implantation to fertilization um what's the intent behind that change representative humphrey um the the definition oh let me see where my definitions are i realize that the the the definition typically used by uh by planned parenthood would be implantation but pregnancy traditionally has been understood to be um when um there is this new life within the mother and she's considered to be pregnant and it's also consistent with the definition in terms of fertilization um in terms of life beginning at conception representative genoa it seems to me that pregnancy is determined when human gorion chorionic gonadotropin is produced and implantation occurs and so that's why i'm questioning this definition that you've given representative humphrey thank you madam chair and and representative geneal um i realize that there's difference of of opinion on that but uh again that's uh i think that's consistent with uh traditional definition that's even you know widespread in in textbooks and that's why it's used in the bill representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair thank you representative humphrey for bringing this bill there was a controversy this past week when a super bowl ad by the doritos corporation showed a pregnant mother and she was receiving an ultrasound and this is not from that doritos ad but this is an actual picture from an ultrasound uh assuming that um and there the controversy was that some of the abortion groups didn't like it because by showing a picture of an ultrasound they said they complained that it humanized the the person or i don't think they use the word person but your language uh in the bill on page 3 line 11 refers to an unborn human being and i know you've talked about zygotes and dna and being unique from the mother but when you look at a picture like this at an ultrasound like this do you consider this a picture of a human being thank you madam chair thank you representative clinton schmidt um abs absolutely um i think that you know it's very common um folks come home they're excited to go and have that ultrasound on and this gets posted on the refrigerator and they don't post it there because it's uh it's uh some you know clinical clinical um product of of conception um but rather they have the distinct distinct sense that that is their baby and so they're very excited about that um and they're excited from um you know from um you know as soon as they they realize that they've had that that test and uh confirmed that there's a pregnancy so they're excited at that point um and uh yeah i think that the the super bowl commercial um the language was there was a there was a tweet um at least i saw a uh a screen shot of it put out by nar narl and um neral i repronounce it and um it's which said uh criticized it for humanizing the fetus um and i think that most americans would find that disturbing i was surprised that they decided to tweet that out any further questions for representative humphrey seeing none will move to the testimony phase representative humphrey do you have a preference with regard to opposition and support or do you want to alternate between the two we have about an equal number for both yeah i'm okay with alternating and uh if if possible there's a pastor groth pastor walker who are here who have some time constraints um and i'm sure that they didn't expect her to be here this long the previous bill took a while so if we could let those gentlemen come up first i'd appreciate it and one other point was that i believe um colorado campaigned for life christy rodriguez would like to testify at the end if that's possible rather than being called up now all right so who were the two that you wanted to call up first pastor groth and walker pastors groth and walker do we lose them come on up and tell us who you are and who you're representing and we will be uh sticking to the three three minute i don't know if you all were in here for the other bill but um there is a timer in front of you and it will turn yellow when you have 30 seconds left and then it will turn red when you are finished and each of you will get your three minutes and then questions will take questions after both of you have spoken all right which one wants to start all right go ahead tell us who you are thank you madam chair my name is jason walker and i am the senior pastor of broomfield baptist church and i do come today on my own and i i represent really myself in this and um as i as i speak before you today i do so as one who is acutely aware of the emotional nature of what we're discussing i have three uh three children who are with us today but i have children who are are in heaven and um so i'm very familiar with the emotional side of things and earlier today as i was thinking about everything that was going on with coming down here to testify before you i i like gary larson's far side comics and i it's hard to put you know a picture is worth a thousand words and and uh one of the comics that i read this morning had a picture of a frog sitting at the end of a runway with uh his tongue well he's not sitting at the end of the runway his tongue is stuck to this airplane that's coming in for a landing on the on the runway and and he's flying through the air i kind of feel like that frog a little bit you know us as preachers talk about our messages and things that we do as as airplanes and so i feel like we're trying to come in for a landing and i'm just holding on by my tongue but um what this issue really means to me from a biblical viewpoint from a biblical viewpoint is that life originates with god human life begins at conception bearing the image of our creator though marred by our sinful nature and children whether born or yet unborn are planned by god they are precious and they are to be treasured and god alone god alone bears the right to end life and this bill i believe will uphold the original intent of our governing documents in striving in a proper use of governmental authority for us the people for good to protect the right to life of the most innocent and precious among us this is a good bill it values life the way god does it respects life in its earliest of stages namely conception and and it protects antenatal life that is certainly fully human it upholds both our first amendment right as americans as well as the sixth commandment of our lord and creator and passage of this bill will allow us to move forward as being part of the solution to some of the most terrible things that are occurring today i therefore urge you to support house bill 1611-13 thank you madam chair thank you pastor walker are there questions for this witness representative schmidt thank you madam chair there's a copy of this photo on your desk i'm going to ask just about every witness the same question assuming that this image is a faithful representation of an ultrasound taken on a pregnant woman do you believe this is a picture of a human being yes sir i do thank you representative klingenschmidt do we have any identification of where this document came from and at what stage this person is um no madam chair all right i'm going to ask you not to ask that question to every witness because we don't have any indication of the stage of um development in this ultrasound that you're showing to people since this bill deals with the time of conception i don't believe that this particular document is relevant to the issue that we're talking about today go ahead representative clinton schmidt madam chair i object and i request the right to ask the witnesses as a representative of my district whatever questions i have in my heart to ask well thank you for your comments but i've made my decision as the chair of the committee won't be allowed to ask that question again thank you all right let's see our next witness please go ahead madam chair and representatives members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is theodore groth and i serve as the pastor of beautiful savior lutheran church in broomfield my comments today like that of my friend are not are my own and are not an official statement from the church i do come today in affiliation with the pillar project which is a non-ecumenical group of religious leaders in colorado who actively lead over 117 000 citizens from 44 colorado cities and collectively we're calling on our elected leaders to support the humanity of the unborn accordingly i do speak today in favor of the life at conception act the bible is god's word and revelation to mankind according to john 17 the words of jesus god's word is truth it is according to the psalmist a lamp to our feet and a light for our path as his most important message to mankind in the bible god has revealed that he loves us and has sent his son jesus christ to suffer die and rise from death to redeem us from sin death and the power of the devil the life of conception acts squares both with the teaching of the bible and with that natural endowment of reason which god has given to each person in other words this act i believe may be defended both on biblical grounds and on the basis of pure reason i'll focus on the former it's the clear testimony of the bible that god is the creator of all things and as maker god is also the owner all things are given by god to us as to stewards that we may use the things of his creation to honor him and serve one another in particular god is the creator of all human beings and each human being the bible teaches that each new human being is the special creation of a wise a powerful and a loving god psalm 139 god has personal intimate knowledge of each human being that he creates from the point of their conception and even before in the book of jeremiah we read before i formed you in the womb says god i knew you i knew you jeremiah the same applies to every human being as the creator of human life god reserves to himself as my friend noted the right to end human life thus in the bible god forbids murder exodus 20 verse 5. in his small catechism dr martin luther explains that this means we should not hurt or harm our neighbor and his body but help and support him in every physical need interestingly luther's explanation makes clear that god commands us both to protect the life of unborn human beings and to help and support their mothers both are required and the work of crisis pregnancy centers demonstrates i believe that both are possible in the bible god commands us to love our neighbor as ourself jesus elevates this and praises this as one of the greatest commandments along with the commandment to love god and we are to open our mouth for the mute and for the rights of all who are destitute the unborn human beings are human beings and they are there for our neighbor to love and they cannot speak for themselves therefore i believe we should as god teaches us speak for them i know we've gone over time in conclusion i wholeheartedly support this act i again thank you for the privilege of speaking today thank you reverend groth we have a question representative primavera thank you madam chair and i represent broomfield so i appreciate you coming down and taking your time today um you know this is not an easy issue i don't think for any of us and especially for not not for me and you know when i hear that god plans every birth i served a couple of years on the 17th judicial district crime victim compensation board and every month we looked at cases where a little girl had experienced incest at the hands of her father uncle brother and was pregnant and didn't want to carry the baby or a person was raped and didn't want to carry the baby so if we go by the premise that every birth or every baby is planned by god my question always was well who planned the rape and the incest that created that baby and i just wondered what you think from a theological standpoint i mean reverend groth thank you madam chair and thank you for the question um god is not the author of evil i believe i think the bible teaches this it's a mystery to us and not ultimately fully explainable to our reason why there is evil in a world in which an almighty god reigns rape must be deplored must be called what it is evil heinous and the law must appropriately deal with those who perpetrate and act like that thank you representative eskar thank you madam chair and thank you both for being here today um i'm the short one right here thank you you both alluded to the fact that in your beliefs god is the one who starts life and god should be the one to end life it am i paraphrasing that correctly you're getting shaking okay thank you my question i and i really mean no disrespect about this is do either one of you have a dnr if you are about to if you're in a hospital sick and you're about to die is that god's will or should the nurse or the doctor try to save you either one a pastor walker a reverent walker pastor is fine thank you madam chair um i do not have a a dnr no ma'am reverend groth i do not have a dnr either i don't uh mr representative humphrey thank you valencia um i i just i just wanted to just say for the folks who are here if you're you're asked a personal question about your own um you know medical history or whatnot you you don't you don't have to answer a question like that um it's fine that you do or not um so um and and i would just i would just add that with regard to the the question about rape and incest which is a you know the question that you have to answer when you're you're dealing with a topic like this um you know it's an incredibly painful circumstance for any woman to go through it's a it's a heinous thing should never happen and of course as was said um you know that offender should be prosecuted prosecuted to the full extent of the law um and of course what we're weighing on the other hand is the fact and the science substantiates this um that you're dealing with a human life from conception a human being i don't know what what what difference um you can what distinction you can make between a human being and a and a human person um and so if if that's if that's what you're dealing with um in that sort of a situation that's um and and and then there's the whole issue of if if the woman does abort um in that situation there's the trauma of dealing with a second trauma which is that of the of the abortion so that's a very difficult situation too because very often um i don't think that victims are are um havocs explained to them when they're in that situation sometimes it's presented as the only option um so i mean the reason for saying that there's no exceptions in those instances is because we are dealing with um a human life that's being weighed in the balances so that's what i would add i don't know i don't know that's supposed to be a question but you could agree or or comment on that representative lontine thank you madam chair and i guess continuing on that line and i think more toward the line that representative primavera was getting at was around the instances of rape and incest and obviously the victim has no choice in that matter i'm sure that she would choose not for that to happen but it i'm unclear representative humphrey answered that question but i would like to hear a response from the two witnesses specifically around the uh the lack of exception in this spill to rape and incest and i would just like to hear what you have to say about that represent or sorry reverend groth thank you for the promotion well that's questionable side sideways thank you for that more direct contact with god than maybe all of us do but go ahead thank you madam jared thank you for the question concerning the cases of uh conception through the unwilling uh unwillingness of the mother who conceives um as rep i do agree with representative humphrey in this sense that um he has spoken much of the science which speaks uh um emphatically and and really clearly uh that the a new human being begins at that at that time of conception um and i spoke uh of what the bible says and the bible also says a new human being comes comes into being and uh i would add that those features or characteristics of a human being that the bible identifies namely the quality of being known by god and by a personal god as person to person maker to creature the quality of being loved by god the quality of their therefore being unique and precious irreplaceable uh of of inestimable value i think those qualities are universally applicable to human beings that being the case difficult as it is to say i su i i do i did not support laws which permit abortion in the cases of a terrible trauma like a rape difficult as it is to say that is what i say and what i must say um i believe based on scripture and and then based also on uh the simple the reason of it it's then for us i think as a community to to do what i said before help and support our neighbor in every physical need so that help care the demonstration in tangible ways of support such as to a rape victim should be the emphasis rather than continued harm done or multiplication of harm by by the destruction of human life uh representative valantine i'm thank you madam chair and you mentioned science um you seem to feel science is on your side with this but you understand that the medical definition of pregnancy is not conception but implantation and there is a difference so i just would like to point out that there is a difference there and that therefore you might want to consider that difference and so no question really all right reps investgar thank you madam chair and i believe this is probably more a question for representative humphrey as you were talking about the trauma that fortunately for the three of you will never have to experience being becoming pregnant from a rape to understand that trauma you understand federal law requires state medicaid programs to cover abortion cases in the case of rape or incest is your intention to with this bill to violate law and prohibit women on medicaid from receiving abortion care if they are survivors of rape or incest reverend growth or maybe representative humphrey thank you madam chair and representative eskar um uh i uh the the intention of the bill is to protect life beginning at conception um and so um the the broader question of the law whether it be um for those um items mandated those federal mandates or the broader issue of the roe v wade decision on on the legal front would be you know there's a there's a distinction between natural rights and then a right created by a majority of judges um who were men in 1973 and creating this a right to privacy which those words never appear of course in the constitution so it was a an activist decision and i think that it is appropriate to challenge that decision and for a state to take that stand in order to do that represent vascular thank you madam chair and just to piggyback on what you're saying uh representative humphrey i know that um all of us in this building really truly believe in upholding the constitution in your opinion is this specific bill constitutional representative humphrey thank you madam chair and representative escar i i believe that what is in the constitution um is constitutional and this this uh decision is widely considered to be um one of the most egregious activist decisions legislating from the bench that has ever occurred and of course it's not the role of the supreme court to legislate so i think it's appropriate for this bill to challenge that yes representative thank you madam chair and thank you to the pastors that have come today we've had several bills up lately that involve the churches and the faith groups and i respect your testimony um and i really appreciate you being here and what you do but not everyone follows the practices of the of the christian faith and um my question to you is how is this bill in line with basically looking at all of the people in colorado do you believe that this is something that all of the people in colorado who may not practice maybe christian but not practice and may not be christian at all do you think they're all going to follow this um yes past pastor walker thank you madam chair speaking from a personal standpoint on this i understand it to speak to one of our most inherent rights as an american and that is the right to life and protecting the right to life as my friend uh said earlier of those who are unable to voice for themselves and speak for themselves and so we are here today to to try to be part of that voice as americans uh upholding the original intent i believe of our founding fathers and and the documents that govern us all uh centering around our first amendment are there any other any other questions reverend klingen i mean well reverend representative clinton schmidt both thank you madam chair and i'm requesting your guidance if i don't phrase this quite the right way please tell me how to ask the question that i think i'm trying to get to we have a book here it's published in 1971 and it's written by roberts rue and landrum shettles who are medical doctors and in this book they have pictures of a 17 week old fetus shown in the act of sucking its thumb this is a picture of what i think is a baby at 17 weeks i think we've established the the time of development stage of this particular photo and i wonder if i could get your permission to ask [Music] father i'm sorry i missed your name growth other growth whether he believes this is a picture of a human being the problem representative klingenschmidt is that what we're talking about here is the moment of conception and when a human life starts i'm going to let you ask the question but i think that the issue this bill goes to is is different than the kind of question you're asking but you may go ahead and ask them thank you madam chair father growth having described the picture do you believe this is a picture of a human being yes sir i do thank you all right any other questions seeing none thank you both for your patience and waiting all day all afternoon and thank you for your testimony thank you so representative humphrey shall we move now to someone opposed with or do you have others that you want to call innocent thank you manager i think alternating is okay i did um have um a request that um connie wisecop and yvonne williams be able to come up certainly miss wyckoff and miss williams do you want to come on up if you can tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone thank you madam chair and members of the committee my name is connie weiskopf i am representing my three children who were aborted before they had a chance for life and also the pregnancy care centers of northern colorado and the many clients that we serve go ahead this is obviously a profoundly moral and human issue i was raped at gunpoint by a man i briefly dated when i ended the relationship he broke into my home and raped me on five separate occasions at gunpoint he was very prominent in the community in which i lived and was very well protected i became pregnant and terminated that child i was told that abortion would solve my problem obviously the baby was not the problem and it added ten things none which were good now i had the rapes and the abortions to overcome i see women every day who believe abortion will solve their problem only to find out later it did not and added many problems that they had never anticipated and never had shared and never were shared before it's a small percent of women who become pregnant and conceived through rape and incest which i'm also a survivor of i was never shown my baby on an ultrasound though an ultrasound was performed i know my babies were not just blobs of tissue but clumps of cells just like me and you they had their own dna and science and technology now has shown me that they had fingers and toes and brain waves and feelings science has shown me that i never things that i never thought when i made that choice out of fear i was never given options i was never told that i had options only that abortion would be the best thing for me never once was my i talked about my baby and its choices again my babies had no choice i went on to bad relationships because of that choice it hardened my heart it caused me to go numb and found myself pregnant two more times and because of that i made that choice two more times i have no children of my own because of those choices thinking i had the rest of my life to conceive and have a family my children were products of my choice but they were i was not shown again that they were children that they had a dna of their own and fingerprints and toes and fingernails if one person had told me about the support and help of pregnancy care centers across this nation which there are over 2 000 i believe i would have three children here today who may be impacting and sitting at the same seats that you are my babies had a right to life but they had no voice and no protection again i have no children of my own god says and i do have a faith in god that my people perish for lack of knowledge i was uninformed about the decisions that i was about to make and they impacted my life greatly negatively i now support other women through the help of pregnancy care centers and speak to women knowing that they have support and hope even in an unplanned pregnancy more than half of all the pregnancies are unplanned but there is hope and there is people out there to walk with them and through this this time in their lives bringing hope bringing healing even in an unplanned unexpected pregnancy even through rape a life is valuable at any size 87 percent of the women who are considering abortion who see their baby on an ultrasound no matter how small change their minds and carry their babies to term miss wyckoff your time is up can you thank you yes it is an economic impact on our community too but again it's a moral and a human issue a bad moral policy is also a bad economic policy and i urge you to support this bill thank you thank you all right let's go ahead with ms williams and then we'll wait for questions until you've both spoken thank you madam chair as the representatives look forward to if this bill were passed who would take care of the women in tragic pregnancies who would take care of the women in pregnancies that just don't have resources and the answer is there's a lot of strength in colorado and across the nation for women who need help with their pregnancy i represent carenet which is an affiliation of well over 30 pregnancy centers here in colorado and every major center center is in a major city and we are helping women and we can certainly increase our efforts as more protection is given to women and babies so i just want to let you know about the strength already available in the state to help women pregnant women and i anticipate that someday there might be legislation hopefully today that would limit abortion and the care for the women is in place it can be accessed immediately thank you thank you and i think i forgot to ask you to state your name in the beginning so yvonne williams and i'm representing karen at the affiliation of pregnancy centers thank you very much do we have any questions for these witnesses representative eskar thank you madam chair and i'm sorry from the short one again um i'm sorry the woman in the checkered jacket yvonne yvonne thank you um you mentioned caring pregnancy centers and i'm i'm just curious if a woman came to a caring pregnancy center and she was looking to have an abortion is that a service you all provide these pregnancy centers i represent do not provide abortion but they are certainly qualified to discuss abortion discuss parenting and discuss adoption representative eskar thank you madam chair and if a woman who came to you for advice and service not knowing where else to go had wanted had decided that she was going to go ahead and go forward with an abortion do you all help them find a safe place to go miss williams thank you madam chair the great service we provide to these women who have obtained abortions is support afterwards for women that have emotional difficulties unsettled perhaps whatever terminology you'd want to use we welcome them with open arms non-judgmental representative blantine thank you madam chair um either of you can answer this question and and i wanted to say i'm i'm sorry about the things that happened to you um that's tragic and thank you but my question is around the issue of birth control do you have an opinion on that issue as well or yvonne maybe for me miss williams we do not provide birth control um our services are more for the woman who's already found herself pregnant although we certainly have um for the woman who is sexually active we take great time and care in discussing her sexual activity with her representative valentina um what specifically are your services the pregnancy centers in colorado would start with a free pregnancy test then there's the referral or the providing of an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy then we have to sit down and really see what the woman needs does she need housing does she need a plan to stay in school either high school or college does she need help with her partner is her partner supportive or not supportive how about her family we're going to sit down with her and help her assess the family strengths she has in this situation then we'll help her find appropriate medical care that she can afford to carry her baby to term as she's carrying her baby to term we stop and really talk about is parenting going to work for you or would you like to talk about the option of adoption and really help her consider is adoption a good choice for her and her baby if she would like to pursue that then we will help her as she interviews adoption agencies and chooses one that's right for her at the birth of her baby whether it's adoption or parenting we support her in that decision we support her in parenting with simple items like clothing and finding good housing if it's adoption we support her as she recovers and encourage her in the good decisions she made following her for years afterwards representative valentine so it seems in either situation that you are there for um a woman after a birth and so it seems that would be a prime opportunity to talk about birth control so at that point do you discuss that miss williams thank you madam chair um we certainly have programs to talk about sexual activity but today i'm not really prepared to talk about contraception since it isn't the main part of this bill representative eskar thank you madam chair and i was just listening to you describe your services at the caring pregnancy center um you talked about a lot of what i heard you talking about was a lot of support and you talked about mental support emotional support so is there licensed therapists that work with the cpcs madam chair thank you for asking that question we certainly have access to referrals to very qualified professionals but the main support a woman needs is often of another woman professionals can see you by the hour and charge for whatever they will and that's certainly appropriate we have a large referral base on that but what we really specialize is woman to woman a best friend if you will then if there is referrals needed to specialists in the mental health community yes and let's don't forget that colorado colorado has a good base of social services for both housing mental health food just a wide variety of services that the state has worked well for representative vascar thank you madam chair and i'm just trying to wrap my mind around the services you all provide you have mentioned housing a few times um do you all just serve as a referral center to send these women in need to other agencies that actually do the service miss williams thank you madam chair both um we're certainly going to use the wonderful agencies already in place in colorado both colorado funded nationally funded church-funded and other organizations that aren't church-funded but have for instance a food bank who knows where it gets funded but yes we want to use the local food banks we are not competing with the state of colorado for resources or for the local food bank for resources so we'll point her to where the resources are if she has a specific need that we can fill without going for instance to the food bank perhaps it's diapers we're really good at diapers we got a lot of those so maybe we can do all the diapers and we don't need to send her out it it's a woman to woman organization and the affiliation is care net the individual pregnancy centers will have individual names a lot of our work also is christian i don't want to beat around the bush on that a lot of people's motivation to serve is christian and if our clients are not christian that is just fine with us any further questions representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair we've photocopied a picture from a medical book written by doctors of a 17 week old fetus shown in the act of sucking its thumb i believe it's available on the table they're right there if you look at this picture do you believe this is a picture of a human being i do indeed believe this is a picture of a human being and i think the sucking of the thumb is a good activity for young human beings thank you for asking me any further questions seeing none thank you both very much for your patience and for your testimony thank you all right we'll now move to someone speaking in opposition and we'll start with two people coming up stephen messwarp and alisa moran come on up and tell us who you are and who you're here representing go ahead thank you madam chair uh my name is stephen messwarp i am the deputy director of the aclu of colorado i am here representing the aclu and speaking out uh in vehement opposition to this bill all right why don't you go ahead and then we'll take miss moran so more than 40 years ago the supreme court decided roe v wade the landmark case that secured a woman's right to abortion since then bills like hb 1113 have been trying to take that decision away from a woman's hands the aclu sees attacks on women's reproductive health care like hb 1113 every day extremists are waging an all-out war state by state passing outrageous laws like this one that restrict access to abortion and threaten women's health in 2014 alone we saw 513 bills in 49 states that sought to restrict women's health care whether it's forced waiting periods medically unnecessary and humiliate and humiliating procedures shutting down health care centers ending programs that provide birth control or flat out bans on abortion politicians seem determined to block women's access to reproductive health care the aclu works in every day in every state to stop these attacks on women and we will always throw the full weight of our organization behind the right of women to make their own health care decisions the aclu realizes that we may not all feel the same way about abortion and for 96 years the aclu has vigorously defended the right of individuals to hold and express different views on abortion and any other issue but reasonably reasonable people understand that deciding whether and when to have a baby or whether to have an abortion is one of the most private and important decisions a person can make it is time to stop interfering and playing politics with women's healthcare i urge you to vote no on hp 1113. thank you go ahead miss moran good afternoon madame chair my name is elisa moran i serve as a board member for the anti-defamation league mountain states region professionally i am a lawyer in private practice for the last 35 years we urge you to oppose house bill 1113. an extreme measure that prohibits abortion from the moment of fertilization and makes a violation a class one felony this bill would violate the religious freedom of coloradans violate the united states constitution provide insufficient exceptions and result in a multitude of harmful unintended consequences adl views reproductive choice as an issue of personal privacy individual liberty and religious freedom we believe that government should not intrude on a woman's deeply personal decision about abortion rather the decision should be made in accordance with her own religious and moral convictions and in cults consultation with a physician of her choosing house bill 1113 gravely endangers religious freedom by imposing one very specific religious view of when life begins women should be free to make decisions about their bodies and their pregnancies in conjunction with their doctors according to their own beliefs and morals as the supreme court expressly recognized in roe v wade religious groups have different ideas about when life begins given these divergent religious views and the morality of terminating a pregnancy laws that seek to codify one religious understanding of when life begins exemplify the problem that the founders sought to prevent in crafting the bill of rights in addition to undermining religious freedom this bill raises serious constitutional concerns by prohibiting abortion from the moment of fertilization it would ban abortions before viability which the supreme court has consistently found unconstitutional the bill also fails to provide critical exceptions to protect women and would prohibit virtually all abortions although the bill technically provides an exception in cases where abortion is necessary to prevent the mother's death this provision is woefully inadequate to protect women's health it does not account for situations in which carrying a baby to term would seriously compromise the physical health of the mother nor does it include an exception for cases in which the woman is a victim of rape or incest for all these reasons we respectfully ask you to oppose this bill thank you thank you miss moran are there questions for either witness representative joshi thank you madam chair and thank you very much for your testimony so since you defend civil liberties do you believe that unborn child has any kind of civil liberty that you want to protect either one go ahead no we do not we would agree representative vlanteen thank you madam chair um my question is from mr mesri swarb excellent thank you um so in your legal opinion will this bill outlaw certain forms of birth control and if you could maybe tell us which if that's appropriate if not i understand miss mr messorb sure so i'm actually not a practicing attorney uh so in terms of uh i'm not an attorney actually not even practicing um so i can actually i cannot answer that um though i i would welcome my uh would you like to take that miss moran i actually think it's probably more an appropriate question to ask one of the medical professionals who will be testifying the one that comes to mind for me is plan b the uh emergency contraceptive i believe would be banned by this bill representative buckner thank you madam chair thank you for being here today i'm trying to remember something but to my recollection it seems like colorado voters have voted down similar bills several times am i correct miss moran or thank you that is my understanding as well that this has gone to the voters and it has been voted down representative escar thank you madam chair and i believe you both referenced this but before the record i just want to i want to have a yes or no question is this particular bill unconstitutional miss mr messi in your legal opinion yes absolutely miss moran thank you madam chair yes we believe it is absolutely unconstitutional thank you representative landgraf thank you madam chair um neither one of you are physicians are you miss moran mr messwarp thank you madam chair i am not no i am not representing landgraf so would you consider yourselves expert on experts on birth control miss moran thank you madam chair i am not mr messer thank you madam chair noy i'm not one representative thank you madam chair mr messler uh you just answered um i think it was representative eskar eskar's question about the constitutionality of this bill but you also said you aren't an attorney is that correct mr messwarp that is correct yes so it's one more go ahead so it's just your opinion that it's not constitutional because you're not an attorney or mr messwab um the supreme court ruled in roe v wade that a woman has a right to an abortion that is still the law of the land this bill we believe would go directly against that so in that sense it is unconstitutional yes thank you representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and thank you mr messer and also miss moran this is a photograph taken from a medical book of a 17 week old fetus in the womb do you believe in your opinion this is a photograph of a human being mr messwarm um thank you for asking representative klingerschmidt i believe that is a photo of a human fetus any further questions representative humphrey thank you madam chair um this question is for either one of you um keith l moore and tbn prasad write in a textbook developing human clinically oriented embryology the following the zygote is the beginning of a new human being human development begins at fertilization the process during which a male gamete or sperm unites with a female gamete or oocyte to form a single cell called a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual my question is would you would you think that it's even possible that abortion ends the life of an innocent human being uh if either one of you want to answer that's fine you don't have to answer if you don't want to mr messwab pass i will also pass all right representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair miss moran i didn't hear your answer to my question do you believe this is a photo of a human being i believe that the madam chair ms moran i believe that that is a photograph that is a fetus who is still unborn at this point any further questions for these witnesses all right thank you very much for your testimony thank you uh representative humphrey i have been told there are a couple of other witnesses that are opposed that have to leave so i'd like to go ahead and call them up that's right all right karen middleton and um a man amanda henderson i believe both of you have to leave so let's have you guys testify and tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone thank you madam chair members of the committee good afternoon my name is karen middleton i am here today representing neral pro-choice colorado where i serve as the executive director and narelle is opposed to house bill 1113 we believe that colorado voters have spoken more than once and they have clearly understood what both this bill says and what personhood means and they have repeatedly said that they do not believe that government has a role in telling women what decisions they should be making with their bodies prior to that child being a child so i am here today to oppose the bill and to ask that the committee honor the will of the colorado voters who have with resounding confidence defeated this version of this measure three times over thank you um reverend henderson thank you representative mccann and members of the committee my name is reverend amanda henderson and i'm the executive director of the interfaith alliance of colorado the interfaith alliance of colorado has a membership of over a thousand people from across the state from 50 different religious communities and congregations as a people of faith from multiple religions and denominations we believe that women should have access to compassionate and shame-free comprehensive care and this bill would stop that from happening this care that women receive is vital to the lives of women and people in our community in our organization we have people representing multiple faiths from jewish buddhist muslim atheists agnostic humanist backgrounds and within all of those different traditions there are many views on when life begins and people from these different backgrounds understand these to be religious and spiritual deeply grounded views as we heard from earlier pastors who testified but we also understand that not all religious people believe life to begin at conception some religious people specifically believe that life does not begin until first breath or in the jewish tradition at the crowning of the head and there are different obligations to care for a woman so within our different traditions we have different views on when life begins and different views on abortion but we share a common belief that we need to be caring for women and giving compassionate care meeting people where they are and respecting a woman's autonomy and her ability to make her own decisions with her family faith leaders and doctors so i am very concerned about this bill 1113 that it would restrict a woman's autonomy to make her own decisions with her own faith leader from her moral conscience thank you are there any questions for these witnesses representative flantine thank you madam chair i'm not sure i heard this right so maybe you could um say it again um it is your belief that the definition of a pregnancy when it starts has more of a religious definition then a scientific definition is if if i'm wrong please correct me and tell me that but if you could reverend henderson thank you thank you for the question um yes i do i believe that there is a scientific definition of when life begins but i believe that oftentimes when we are arguing about these questions that we're using terms that are more spiritual and religious and less scientific and when we are prioritizing one religious view over the scientific views that that is an infringement on religious freedom and that that does not respect the multiple and different religious views that people hold thank you so i think it is both scientific and spiritual question uh representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair i have a question for the nayral representative i'm sorry i forgot your name after the doritos commercial in the super bowl there was a tweet which is just handed to me by the nayrol organization not buying it that doritos ad using anti-choice tactic of humanizing fetuses do you think um showing pictures of ultrasounds has the effect of humanizing a fetus miss middleton thank you madam chair thank you representative klingenschmidt for the question i don't watch much tv and i didn't watch the super bowl so i'm not i don't totally get the reference but i'm not sure that that's relevant to the conversation here in fact what i think we're talking about is we're not here to determine when life begins we're here to determine if the law should be infringing on a woman's right to make decisions about her body and it really start starts and ends there so that's where i'll limit my response thank you thank you representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair i'm reading the bill on page three it begins putting into law the definition of a human being so i think my next question is relevant when it comes to defining what a human being looks like before you is a picture of taken out of a medical book by a couple of doctors of a fetus at 17 weeks of development sucking its thumb do you believe this is a picture of a human being and that's for both witnesses please um you can answer if you want you don't have to thank you madam chair i see that it says at the top it's a 17 week old human fetus and the answer is in the textbook actually in the picture so thanks represent reverend henderson thank you i would affirm the same uh that it is a a picture of a human fetus thank you representative gennall thank you madam chair and thank you both for being here today um this i guess question can be answered by both of you but i guess i'm going to start with karen middleton earlier today the business affairs and the labor committee voted down a similar bill and it occurs to me that this is not the legislature's business and what a woman does with their body would you agree that this bill would put more obstacles between a woman and her doctor miss middleton thank you madam chair thank you representative geneal for the question madam vice chair um yes um i believe that that's really the heart of this matter is who's making these decisions um i think probably the most egregious aspect is that we not only have had the colorado voters answer this question with resounding force and you know if you know your colorado history colorado history is fairly strongly anti-government we don't want government in our business and in our personal private decisions really regardless of gender but in the particular case of women being faced with this question time and time again not just at the ballot box but we had six bills that didn't look very different from this last year which is an exponential increase from the year before and we're seeing understand that the state of colorado is part of a national trend line of seeing more and more bills like this and unfortunately in some states these bills are passing that are affecting women's lives every single day and so um i would ask you to take that into account and i appreciate your question thank you thank you representative buckner thank you madam chair and thank you ladies um remember henderson i'm a woman of faith and i'd like to know when you're counseling some of the women who are either pregnant or who have had abortions can you tell me what some of those conversations are like reverend henderson thank you for the question i i do think that uh there are so many different issues that surround the issues of pregnancy an unwanted pregnancy or a wanted pregnancy and there can often be so much pain and suffering so my theology is that god is walking alongside a woman and holding her when she's crying and crying with her when she is crying and guiding her as she makes what decision is best for her in that moment and that god loves her regardless and surrounds her with the community and the people that she needs to walk through that time of pain or joy whatever it is and the circumstances around her pregnancy and i understand is that that as how we are also called to be with one another that we are called to listen to walk with and to trust those we are caring for thank you i appreciate that any further questions representative joshi thank you madam chair it's not a question just a comment since representing gina mentioned my bill which was just behind in the business affairs committee that bill had nothing to do with what a woman does with her body or doesn't do anything with her body that bill had everything to do what a criminal does with that woman's body and kills her unborn child so i just wanted to make it very clear and just to be on record 38 states have passed a similar bill colorado is very backward representative landgraf thank you madam chairman i apologize i don't know the name of the reverend robert anderson henderson so you you spoke very eloquently about god um being with the woman and crying with the woman and i agree completely i'm catholic and uh so i have certain beliefs but we hear about the miracle of birth all the time so are you implying that while god walks hand in hand with the woman has god play no role in the baby reverend henderson thank you for the question um i think that god is everywhere and with us through our pain and through life and through death and i think that these are pieces of life and suffering and that god is with us and this is not an easy decision and i'm not saying that it is or taking it lightly but i am saying that god is caring for that woman who is making that decision and that difficult choice just as he is with her god is with her not he um god is with her uh if when she is in pain if she is raped or in cases of incest that's not god's will i would not say that that is god's will i would say that god is alongside and suffering and walking with through the ups and downs of life representative landgraf thank you madam chair i would agree that's definitely not god's will i don't think it was god's will my when my son had a severe brain injury um but but you continue to talk about god being with the woman and you ignore the fact that you know what about the baby is god not with the baby has god abandoned the baby reverend henderson so that's when i'm talking about the the definition of when that that life begins and that baby is able to sustain um and be a a child um that at a certain point it's a fetus and that decision of when the baby is viable not these are scientific and spiritual questions i think a question that would deserve further conversation is the human role of control the question came up earlier about a dnr we could also talk about in vitro fertilization we have this we have science to be able to help us in medical procedures and we can use those these are medical ethical questions for a person to decide based on their beliefs and their their religious spiritual beliefs we have many different medical decisions that we make on a day-to-day basis that affect life and death thank you representative thank you madam chair and i just want to clarify something about the it seems in the i know that 38 states i think you mentioned this uh have laws that that create penalties for harming a pregnancy colorado doesn't colorado have that too um and it's called the crimes against pregnant women's act miss middleton thank you madam chair thank you madam vice chair for the question um in fact yes uh we are unique in having put penalties into place that uh uh penalize a criminal who has harmed a woman and an unborn fetus without introducing personhood into our state law i i would consider that an uh a better solution forward and the the impact of having laws and we're not speaking to that bill in this committee so i won't go on for more than a moment um has really not been um not been helpful to women and children in the way that it's been proposed so representative bryden thank you madam chair and miss middleton and reverend thank you for being here today um there aren't that many of us here who were here when or were adults at least when roe v wade was passed and it seems to me that we need to have a little enlightenment about what life was like then and perhaps what it would be like if this bill should pass and i'm talking in terms of the safety of the of the woman and what will happen if if those services are no longer available and i'd like to hear from miss middleton on that i'm sure you you have the history even if you didn't live it yourself ms middleton uh thank you madam chair thank you representative ryden and i think you might have thought i was younger there for a moment that's even better um but i um what i would say is yes the days before roe v wade are are not just well documented but the dangers of limiting access to women's health care is being seen and felt across the united states right now while we're talking about this bill as restrictions are passed we are seeing women who are having to who who are self-aborting who are trying by any means necessary to control their fertility when the law of the land does not allow them in particular states and i would suggest that the it's a tragic story that we don't want to repeat colorado has a very strong record i will remind you that in 1965 we passed some of the first laws around legalizing access to birth control and in 1967 we legalized abortion in this state ahead of california and ahead of roe v wade so we have a strong trend line again of government not interfering in these issues and i would ask that the committee take that very seriously and and continue to uphold what has really been a tradition here in the state of colorado thank you any further questions for these witnesses representative brown thank you madam chair just just one one question maybe to both of you is a human fetus a human being in your opinion uh go ahead representative henderson i mean reverend henderson i think that that is a matter of a person's own conscious and their religious and spiritual um beliefs i i think that viability outside the womb is a scientific question but whether it is a human being is a spiritual question all right any further questions representative humphrey thank you um yeah i i think you know a lot of a lot of your answers presuppose on that on there are hinged on that that key issue of you know is that uh is the unborn um a human being and as i pointed out earlier in my remarks i mean that that is the key question um and so um you can talk about the um you know the the this the size of that human being their level of development the environment they're in the uh the degree of dependency that they um are characterized by um but in in every case if they're a human being um those distinctions don't really hold um you can respond to that if you want the other thing i would simply say was was with regard to the ballot propositions um on personhood i think the most that you can really say there is that that political strategy uh is a failed political strategy i think you can say that that was some referendum by the voters on on the life issue because obviously they were outspent by multiples of of two or three by pro-abortion groups so you can respond or not but just wanted to make those observations all right any further questions for these witnesses seeing none thank you very much for your patience today and for sticking around thank you and your testimony um all right representative humphrey do you have any particular order of witnesses that are here in support or should i just go down the list i think you can just go down the list at this point madam chair just okay noting that uh colorado campaign for life preferred to be towards the end there right okay uh ed hanks come on up and tell us who you are oh are you one of the ones that want to go toward the end no okay go ahead would you tell us who you are and if you are here representing anyone my name is ed hanks and i'm with colorado right to life we sponsor personhood amendments and we use the anti-slavery crusade as our model william lloyd garrison is the man most responsible for ending slavery in the u.s for 35 years he argued that men and women are human beings no matter the color of their skin no matter how society tries to define them as something other than human no amount of explaining and no authority not even the supreme court could logically or morally take that status away from them the symbol of garrison's newspaper the liberator was the image of a black slave chained hands raised pleading am i not a man and a brother personhood says people have rights by the very nature of being human that wasn't popular that wasn't a popular message society had been taught the supreme court even affirmed that black people were not people in a real sense but more and more americans realized garrison was right all people are human beings and all human beings have rights the supreme court was absolutely wrong when it ruled in dred scott that slaves other human beings could be considered property and could be owned by another person roe v wade paralleled this idea the supreme court ruled that unborn children are property owned by their mothers who may dispose of that property this remains the court's position today they're as wrong about this today as they were in 1858 human beings may not be considered property they are people should be considered persons in the eyes of the law they have unalienable rights and a violation of those rights as human rights abuse to the pro-lifer to the democrats on this committee i say forget the propaganda you know abortion is not a celebration of hope or freedom at best it's a utilitarian fudge as democrats you did not come to this state house to be utilitarians to sacrifice justice and rightness to the practicality of the moment you are you are idealists your philosophy proclaims freedom for all protection for all people especially the weak and powerless are your principles universal who should be excluded uh in history we've seen powerless human beings defined a way on the argument that they're not really human if a baby in the womb is he is not human what is she what is the measure of a man or a woman am i not a man and a brother democrats used to take this to heart president kennedy once said on the question of limiting population as you know the japanese have been doing it very vigorously through abortion which i think would be repugnant to all americans furthermore abortion is not a religious issue any more than ending slavery was hippocrates and the pagan greeks in ancient times recognized the sanctity of human life as an important moral logical and ethical issue the hippocratic oath made doctors pledge i will not give a woman a poison to cause an abortion that's apparel to the life at conception legislation you're considering today the advance of medical science has uh put the human eye inside the womb the humanity inside the womb is even more obvious today how advanced is a society that gives the greater good serves the greater good by sacrificing the weakest or least convenient among us is that a model society or is that a horror a perversion of a moral and ethical society please reverse this injustice today i ask you to vote for this bill thank you buckner thank you madam chair i can't read what was your name sir i'm sorry ed hanks hi ed hanks first of all um i'm trying to figure out why you're looking at me while you're saying this i you look directly at me instead of the rest is it just because i'm african-american i was speaking to democrats in general and you're kind of in the middle of that group okay thank you for clarifying that also do i look like a human being of course you do okay and would you please tell me what law were you talking about the dred scott decision in 1858 the supreme court the foremost legal um uh arbiter in the land said that uh the black pers the black man has no rights that the white man is bound to respect that's part of the law or part of the ruling i should say that they handed down in 1858 which uh said that that slavery was a constitutional right and you believe that representation oh of course not i believe that that was an abomination mr hanks i have to recognize the two of you because people might be listening in on the internet they don't yes speaking so representative buckner i'm sorry chair i'm just you know this is um if you're trying to incite me you're doing a pretty good job but um comparing talking about slavery this is a ridiculous analogy about slavery and you're talking about something that happened in 1858 that is not the law today sir mr hanks did you have a response yes ma'am um i see a one-for-one parallel and i appreciate that you may not see that and perhaps that's because it's not been brought to you in this way before but um the supreme court did rule at that time that slavery was constitutional just as it ruled in 1973 that abortion was constitutional the fact that they rule that something is constitutional does not mean that it's right or will always be considered uh the law of the land uh the proper or the uh the slave owners at that time used arguments very similar to what we hear from pro-abortion people today they say uh that prohibiting slavery would be an unconstitutional violation of an individual's property rights and their personal autonomy autonomy in dealing with his land and his possessions it did not respect deeply held personal decisions about slavery and they surely said if you don't believe in slavery don't own one and furthermore that the government has no right to tell them what they could do with their own property the arguments of the pro-slavery people at that time were that black people could be abused because they were not human beings and they introduced certain arguments to support that which are very similar to the arguments i hear today saying well an unborn child may have human dna but we don't consider them human because they set out four or five criteria arbitrary criteria for determining whether they are human beings or not and so i do see a parallel and i hope that you would consider that oh my goodness uh excuse me madam chair yes obviously i cannot accept that i don't appreciate it and uh may i direct a question to um representative humphrey certainly go ahead um representative humphrey is this your belief as well representative humphrey uh madame chair and representative buckner um i would say that there there are parallels in terms of that was a supreme court case that was termed turned over um and uh just to go to the point that you know once the supreme court makes a decision doesn't mean that it's set in stone in a fashion that it cannot be uh reversed and secondly i would say that certainly um as far as i know in the history of slavery part of the justification of slavery was an argument that that african slaves were not human persons in the same sense as their owners boy that's real excuse me representative representative humphrey that's pretty hard to digest um very hard to digest for me and i'm sure you can understand why but um you know what this this excuse me madam chair and representative humphrey and sir this this conversation has come up year after year after year and you're using the slavery um information here to relate it to your bill and it has nothing it has no comparison you're totally off base and um you have it just keeps coming up and i do have a statement to make well let's just do questions right now um because we will be having plenty of time for statements and we do have another 15 to 20 witnesses to get through well i hope we i hope we can get off this slavery thing right now because the comparison the comparison is absolutely ridiculous and you can imagine why it's very inflammatory and i really personally think that that's why they're saying this because it's inflammatory but to compare slavery to this i'm an intelligent woman there's a lot of intelligent people in this room and hopefully you're not using this to support your bill sorry that's it thank you representative janal thank you madam chair uh mr hanks you support this bill right yes uh i do and colorado right to life does representative geneal thank you madam chair so do you also support the criminalization of women and their doctors mr hanks colorado right to life supports the protection of the human life in the womb as a human person and uh therefore once the humanity and the personhood of the unborn is recognized they would have rights which could not be violated by a doctor or even a mother because that would be a human rights abuse i believe that it is in fact a human rights abuse which at this point is gone unchecked and is endorsed by the government in i'm sorry to say that i don't mean to inflame but i i believe this is thought-provoking in the same way as the supreme court's decision in 1816 1858 endorsed the human rights abuse of representation just a clarifying question um yes or no would do you support the criminalization of women and their doctors mr hanks i support the personhood and the respect under law of the unborn child and if someone kills and we term it murder if someone murders an unborn child then of course they would be guilty representational thank you so is that a yes or no it's a yes as far as you uh phrase it that way if abortion is murder and a doctor commits a murder then certainly that would be considered a murder although this bill is drafted in such a way that it would uh not have penalties for the woman all right uh let's see representative primavera's had her hand up for a while thank you madam sharon thank you for being here um again this is not an easy issue for me but i go back again to my work with the crime victims and your comments about the sanctity of human life and i would assume that means all lives and you know your question about it is am i not a human i attended a panel once at a victim [Music] a victim advocate conference where i heard that one of the victims of brent j brentz i think you remember him who was a rapist in in the town and this woman said that if she had become pregnant by this man and had to carry this devil baby she would have committed suicide so whose life is more sacred mr hanks colorado right to life of course takes the position that an unborn child is a human being and a person deserving of rights and so there are actually two people whose rights and feelings and considerations must be considered i appreciate the difficult situation and the deep pain and grief associated with rape but the victimization of a young woman or a woman of any age by rape does not justify the victimization of the baby and the re-victimization of the mother statistics show that um women who have abortions almost uh overwhelmingly have deep uh emotional physical trauma feelings of suicide which are associated not with the rape but uh not merely with the rape but also with the abortion even if they get an abortion for a reason unconnected to rape the fact that a crime was committed against this woman does not justify another uh injustice be performed i also was friends with a young woman who when she was younger had been a victim of incest at the hands of her father and i i should also say that in many of these circumstances um of rape that the uh woman ends up carrying the baby to term and has that baby as the only good thing to come out of the rape it becomes a uh method of healing but also this young woman who had been victimized by incest i discovered later that she had donated this 20 year old girl had donated to colorado right to life and the only way i can imagine that she would have done that is that she recognized that if abortion had been illegal even in cases of rape and incest that her victimization would have been exposed and then this is a case this is a situation that comes up very often a young woman who is the victim of incest is frequently afraid to tell anybody but they're they're just waiting for someone to ask them the question are you okay are you being abused if abortion had been illegal her father would not have been able to take her to the abortion clinic to have his crime covered up which is what happens on a regular basis and her family and her teachers and her friends would have been asking how did this happen and eventually it would have come out that her father was raping her so i consider that and the other things i've stated as alternative instances and alternative circumstances which i think have to be considered i know rape and incest is a very emotional issue but it's not all one way any further questions for this witness representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and thank you mr hanks i have a question for both you and the bill sponsor representative humphrey i am personally mortified by american history that used to consider that african americans were not human that is just repugnant to me and i think for the supreme court to have ruled at one time that african americans are not human is absolutely repugnant to me uh do you agree with my sentiment absolutely i'm sorry all right absolutely i do represent clinton schmidt can we keep to the bill itself please yes ma'am so that parallels to the argument in the bill on page three it refers to who is a human being in fact in this case this law would define unborn children as human beings which in 1973 the supreme court said well maybe they're not human beings but that idea is also repugnant to me it's creating the ability to dispose of these people as if their personal property and so i refer you to this photo that we took out of a medical book a 17 week old fetus sucking its thumb do you believe this is a photograph of a human being mr hanks i do and i believe that as a matter of faith but also as a matter of science and uh and medicine that is a human being it is an individual human who exists uh dependent on the mother but uh who exists as with their own dna they have their own biological processes they have their own dna that is unique from the mother and uh in fact they have they possess dna which is foreign to the mother and i feel that because of those faith objections but also because of uh scientific and uh medical and ethical considerations i find it awkward that the american civil liberties union uh believes that there are some human beings that are not deserving of civil liberties all right um thank you mr hanks for your testimony and um we will move now to thank you you bet thank you for coming up and and your patients in waiting all afternoon dr schneider and dr lazarowicz if you two could come up together tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone thank you madam chair my name is dr emily schneider i am representing myself as a board certified practicing obstetrician gynecologist here in denver colorado i apologize if i seem tired i've been up for 36 hours as i was delivering babies last night and baiting waiting here today for this moment because i think it's very important to be here as a comprehensive women's health care provider to talk about how house bill 1113 if passed would jeopardize will jeopardize the health and safety of my patients it defines pregnancy from the moment of fertilization we know that 30 to 70 percent of fertilized eggs do not develop into a fetus due to natural processes making it illegal to terminate all fertilized eggs will limit the ability physicians like myself to administer safe and medically appropriate treatments for ectopic pregnancies spontaneous miscarriages or molar pregnancies which can all be life threatening to the mother passing this bill will ultimately cause my patients harm if i have to delay medically necessary treatment to contemplate actions and think about if they could be considered a felony i've treated a wide array of patients in my practice every woman is different and every family situation is also different as a physician i have to be able to use my best medical judgment based on the individual needs of the patient after considering all of their pregnancy options including continuation to term with parenthood adoption or termination for example my patients have included a developmentally delayed 15 year old who is raped by her brother's friend i also care for patients who are couples that are desperate to have a child but there they find out that their pregnancy ends in miscarriage or fetus with a lethal fetal anomaly one of my patients was a woman in her second trimester who was involved in a severe motor vehicle car crash that severed her spine and left her unlikely to survive her injuries because continuing the pregnancy may have seriously affected the ability of her organs to function these are not hypothetical horror stories these are the real life private medical decisions faced by me my patients and other physicians every single day abortion is a very personal and complicated choice for women and couples during the reproductive years i am privileged to be able to help women during this time by providing them with accurate science-based information and the best possible care legislating the doctor-patient relationship interferes with safe and legal standard of care that is currently provided house bill 1113 invades the medical privacy of women that is essential for appropriate clinical care that they need including women dealing with unavoidable early pregnancy failures and those who must consider termination of pregnancy this bill will ultimately hurt my patients and the women of colorado i urge you to vote no on this bill thank you dr schneider dr uh lazzowitz elizabeth please go ahead thank you man i'm sure my name is aaron laswitz i am here representing myself i am here today as an individual physician to discuss how house bill 1113 would put both the women of colorado and the physicians who care for them at serious risk house bill 1113 would essentially ban virtually all abortions in colorado and severely criminalized physicians who perform abortions not only is this bill unconstitutional under roe v wade but is an egregious attempt to restrict the reproductive rights of the women of colorado as an abortion provider i strive to respect the arduous and often difficult choices that women have to make when considering an abortion my priority as a physician is to provide women with respectful and appropriate care without the interference of intrusive bills such as this one the doctor-patient relationship is a fundamental key to providing safe and appropriate care to everyone and this bill is a market intrusion into that relationship i've cared for women seeking abortions because they have three young children at home and simply can't afford to care for another child without putting her ability to feed and clothe her other children at risk i've cared for women still in high school who find themselves in the terrible circumstance of deciding between having a child and potentially dropping out of school or having an abortion and pursuing college or a career they've always dreamed of i've also cared for women who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest and this bill would force those women to give birth to the rapist child rape and incest are such traumatic experiences already and house bill 1113 would inflict further trauma on these women who don't want to be pregnant though there is an exception in this bill that allows for abortion in the case of a woman's life being at risk who gets to decide what amount of risk is sufficient to prevent prosecution depression and pregnancy is a surging crisis in the field of obstetrics and suicide is one of the largest contributors to maternal mortality how depressed would a woman need to be before she could have an abortion or should all depressed pregnant women be institutionalized so as to force treatment and constant surveillance on them to remove the life-threatening condition and force them to continue their pregnancies house bill 1113 does nothing to address the current health disparities in colorado and outlawing abortion which transported us back to the pre-roe v wade era when desperate women sought out illegal abortions and our hospitals were filled with women septic and dying from the resulting complications safe and legal abortion has given women the power to make their own reproductive choices and i became an abortion provider to ensure the women of colorado continue to have all the reproductive options i urge you to vote no on house bill 1113 and to stand with the women and physicians of colorado thank you very much um doctors uh representative joshi thank you madam chair and thank you very much for your testimony uh in your practice do you take care of pregnant patients too either one both of you want to answer that thank you madam chair yes i do so when you discuss with your patient who are pregnant do you refer that that how your baby is doing or do you tell them how your fetus is doing dr schneider thank you madam chair that is an individual uh decision that my patients make i refer with the language that they use they sorry madame go ahead representative if they say it's a baby you would let them know how their baby is doing dr schneider thank you madam chair again that's if that's their individual decision to make that and call it their baby then yes thank you any further questions representative primavera thank you madam chair and i hope you go home and get some rest um i i just you know a lot of times when we have bills in front of us we have to wonder about how they'll be implemented and i just wondered in terms of hipaa how um you know if a woman comes to you and needs a dnc or whatever that's hipaa protected so how would how would we even know who performed these kinds of women's health services or not uh dr schneider or dr lavlor thank you man i'm sure um that's a very good point um and this bill does nothing to address that um situation and you're right reporting reporting that would violate hipaa thank you uh representative uh eskar thank you madam chair and this is for either one or both of you um if this bill were to pass into law and a woman came to you and she was having complications with her pregnancy would you feel comfortable knowing that there's a possibility if you treat her or help her there could be a felony over your head dr schneider or doctor i'm going to get it right this time lazarowicz thank you madam chair it puts me in a very uncomfortable situation i have large student debt from my medical school um and i have a family to feed so um unfortunately i took uh well not unfortunately unfortunately i took an oath to do no harm and if i felt that that was the best thing for my patient that's what i would do represent uh sorry dr lazarowicz thank you madam chair you know pregnancy itself is a life-threatening condition women die from pregnancy you know across the country and so complications of that is a life-threatening condition and so even with that risk i would do my due diligence in what i've been trained to do and to take care of that woman um just as a follow-up to that question so the thing that disturbs me a lot about this bill is that it would subject people like you to first degree felony charges which has the potential of life in prison so i guess my question is i mean what do you think your colleagues are going to do if they're faced with the possibility of being charged with a class one felony versus performing an abortion dr schneider thank you madam chair i think given the fact that only 10 to 15 percent of physicians today perform abortions because there's so much stigma that's already around this issue even less are going to continue to perform this if this bill were to pass and meaning that we're going to see more of a pre-roe v wade scenario with women dying all right any other questions representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair before you is a photo taken from a medical book of a 17 week old fetus sucking its thumb do you believe this is a photo of a human being either one of you dr uh lazarowicz thank you madam chair um as this states it's a 17 week old fetus i agree it's a fetus any other questions all right well thank oh i'm sorry representative ransom thank you madam chair to follow up on that um in latin i'm sure you'd know this that fetus means living one and my other question so my question to that then is is it alive um if you can answer feel free if you're if you can't that's fine too dr schneider thank you madam chair um it's alive because it's living off of its mother without its mom it's not living representative ransom thank you madam chair and i accept that it obviously is dependent on its mother while it's inside i i get that completely but if it's not alive then it's dead and dead things don't grow and it keeps growing so i'd love to hear feedback on that as physicians that are working with pregnant women all the time dr schneider or dr lazarus thank you madam chair i think that um you know i see embryos and petri dishes and um they're clearly being sustained because of science all right representative branson thank you madam chair i need to follow up on that scientifically then the fetus has brain waves and a heartbeat which is scientifically they see they can see that you can see it i know you do ultrasounds when you're working on that um so scientifically there would be evidence that there is something something going on some type of life something that's growing yes dr schneider or dr lazarowicz thank you madam chair um i believe that it's not living without something else sustaining it so i do not consider it a human being all right uh representative primavera thank you madam chair um in the bill on and you don't have in front of you or maybe do on page four lines eight through ten it says a pregnant mother upon whom the termination of the life of an unborn child is performed or attempted is not guilty of violating this section so i assume that means that if a woman comes to you and asks you to perform an abortion you would you could go to prison for life for that but the woman would not have any sort of criminal penalty does that seem fair schneider dr uh lazarowicz thank you madam chair um i mean this bill has nothing to do with fairness so no thank you representative ryden thank you madam chair and i have a sort of a similar question on that same page even though they seem to be giving an out to uh physicians who cause accidental or unintentional injury um they would not be guilty but when would they know that they were not guilty it sounds to me as if there's a huge legal cloud hanging over their head immediately if this should pass because they are the ones that would have to defend themselves and it it it would in effect probably um discourage anyone from from practicing and providing these reproductive services to women and i just wonder if that's the way our doctors uh see that provision in the bill as well dr schneider dr lazarowicz thank you madam chair i also see that interpretation of the bill as well and when you know given the level of penalty that could be set up on a physician as a class one felony i you know i couldn't hold it against any physician if this bill were to pass to not put themselves in that kind of situation given the risks thank you all right are there any further questions for our medical doctors well i just want to thank you both i know you've been here since like noon i think and particularly dr schneider staying up for 36 hours i hope you're not delivering babies tonight um so hopefully you can get some sleep we do appreciate your patience in waiting around and testifying today thank you thank you um all right we'll now move to someone in his favor austin mullins come on up mr mullins and thank you for your patience and tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone my name is austin mullins you need you got it just hit that little button there okay my name is austin mullins um i'm here representing myself and uh my hope is that most all of us would say that we believe that human life is sacred so the question then becomes when does life begin looking at science my answer is that life begins at conception just recently the media became ecstatic over the possibility of evidence of water found on mars if this is what it's like when they discover possible evidence of water imagine what it would be like if they discovered a few unstructured unorganized cells i doubt that many people would be quick to dismiss it and say it's just a blob of cells yet that is exactly what they say when they see a structured organized beautiful creation like an unborn baby this just cell's argument is utterly ridiculous cells are only found in living organisms cells are known as the building blocks of life and the smallest units of life so by definition they are part of something alive on the other hand the blob part of the argument is also invalidated by modern technology we now have images that show not a mere blob but instead a structured organized life real time ultrasound videos have shown babies sucking their thumb yawning and stretching they have even shown unborn children hiccuping covering their ears in response to loud noises and smiling within just 22 days of conception the child's heart is formed and functioning pumping the baby's own blood distinct from the mothers by five to seven weeks electrical brain activity can be detected though there are more many more facts i could point to i would like to leave with one last statement in a 1996 article pro-choice feminist naomi wolf stated her belief that the pro-choice community should recognize the fetus in its full humanity and that abortion causes quote a real death kate mitchellman another prominent pro-choice activist declared that technology has clearly helped to define how people think about a fetus as a full breathing human being these people know and admit the truth that the unborn are alive yet they still continue in the promoting of the killing of the most innocent victims is that the colorado we want to live in is that the country we want to live in my answer is a definite resounding no thank you thank you mr mullins are there questions for this witness representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair mr mullins thank you for your testimony this is a photograph taken from a medical book of a 17 week old fetus sucking its thumb in your opinion is this a picture of a human being mr mullins yes sir thank you any other questions for this witness seeing none thank you for your patience hanging around this afternoon and for your testimony all right um i believe is christina aguilar still here she left and so did bertie becker right she left all right greg garland come on up and tell us who you are and who you're here representing uh i am as you said the reverend greg garland and uh from the other aisle of broomfield i'm the pastor at the united church of broomfield uh united church of christ representative to the colorado religious coalition for reproductive choice which is the primary religious voice in colorado for reproductive justice as a representative of the united church of christ i am here to represent our denomination's position consistent with that of the colorado rcrc that every woman must have the freedom of choice to follow her personal religious and moral convictions concerning the completion or termination of her pregnancy i also consider myself pro-life and i'm here to tell you that this bill is not pro-life it's merely pro-birth i'm pro-life as i value all life as part of god's creation i see value in all life including a fertilized human egg but i do not value all life equally i do not give the same value to a potential person as i do to an actual person to do so i think is absurd but that is what this bill wants us to do this bill wants us to give equal value and rights to a potential person as we do to an actual person this bill wants us to see a few cells sporting human dna in equal value to an actual woman in religious terms such a denial of rights to an actual person a person with personality autonomy agency will self-recognition and conscience that's what we call a sin there are many reasons why a woman might choose to end her pregnancy that all fall in the realm of moral ethical faithful and loving that is to say that there are many reasons i believe that god would want someone to terminate their pregnancy such a decision is usually a difficult and complicated matter it may take many hours of prayer counseling and education it is a process of discernment that only those intimately involved are capable of making such a decision should not be arbitrarily dictated by the state with no recognition of an individual situation or faith this bill is not pro-life it's not pro-life to destroy the life freedom and opportunity of any woman it is not pro-life to force rape or incest victims to give birth against their will it is not pro-life to make criminals out of medical staff doing what they believe is medically advisable it is not pro-life to displace the life and rights of an actual woman with the life and rights of a potential person i believe this is a bad bill and i urge you to vote down thank you uh thank you reverend garland are there questions representative ransom thank you madam chair reverend i would like to um mention to you um that i've been getting a lot of emails from people on this bill and a lot of them are from men and i have also heard from many people that are interested in this topic and in the discussion that men should not be able to weigh in on this discussion because men cannot be pregnant men cannot go through the emotional things that we women go through um when being pregnant and then having to give birth and go through that but um obviously you're here and you're weighing in on the discussion and i would i would like to know your your feedback on that if you do think it's appropriate for men to have an equal say in in our decision making as we evaluate this bill reverend garland uh i think it's appropriate that men have a say i personally think it's inappropriate that the vatican has a say in that they don't have families they don't have those experiences i do have a family i do have those experiences i do participate with my wife i participated in the birth i participated in the conception but um that being said i would give 99 of the choice on the matter to the woman not the man the man contributed a very small amount to this and she contributes much more representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair and thank you for your testimony as a minister i appreciate your coming and giving us your opinion on these matters displayed in front of you is a photograph taken from a medical book of a 17 year old fetus excuse me 17 week old fetus who is sucking his thumb in your opinion is this a photograph of a human being in my opinion that is a photograph of a human but you trying to equate being with person it has not yet developed enough to be considered a person it has not yet developed enough to accrue the rights that would override the rights of the woman uh representative lanteen thank you madam chair and thank you for being here i you brought up excuse me the issue around being pro-birth could you talk about that a little more about um i see some folks who are on the side of this issue but who once a child comes into the world and a mother can't afford to take care of that child don't seem to be too interested in in the welfare of that child so could you talk a little bit about that issue please reverend garland if i could just start that one more time for me you go ahead thank you madam chair you brought up the issue of being pro-birth that you see these some folks being pro-birth but not really pro yeah could you talk about that yes um thank you um reverend garland the i think it's very important that we look at not just the fetus as what we're dealing with but the entire life situation the the woman involved the family involved um you know you focus on the birth of this one but the birth of this one may cause a family of five to go into poverty and increase health risks and kill some of them i mean there's a lot more to be involved than just giving birth to the child um and if it's if it is the woman's decision that somehow bringing this life in into this world is going to risk the health and welfare of herself or her other family members then that too needs to be considered and i don't think it's right to take that decision out of her hands representative primavera thank you madam chair and well i represent broomfield and my broomfield faith community has really uh stepped up today to come testify on this bill of course as a split you know some of the religious people support this bill and some don't don't but i think you and i um share the same sort of question about whose life is more sacred you know the woman who's been raped or the baby or fetus that's inside and so i just first of all just want to thank you for the work you do in broomfield and i really don't have a question all right any further questions thank you very much reverend garland um lisa coates come on up and tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone thank you for your patience i'm lisa coates and i am here representing pregnancy care centers pregnancy resource centers as well as the approximately 250 post-abortive women i have worked with over the last 10 years i do have a very quick email to read to you she could not be here today all right this was because of a fetal abnormality after my ultrasound i was asked to see a specialist in denver for medical reasons the doctor strongly encouraged and pressured me to have an abortion the concern was if my child survived it would ruin my marriage finances and extended families lives what ruined our lives was the taking of our child this child was not tissue but a living breathing human being it is a dangerous thing for humankind to mess with the natural course of life if a child is to live so be it or to die from natural causes so be it man should not determine who lives or dies life begins at conception and the child in the womb should have the same rights to life as the child outside the womb and incidentally since this is the insurance committee she shared with me that her abortion costs more than either one of her live births abortion is not health care health care makes things better abortion is a life and death decision and there are no do-overs i have heard it said that abortion is murder for hire 64 of women who choose abortion have been coerced heavily influenced or forced that's unchoice dot com in open journal of obstetrics and gynecology 2014 30 percent of women worldwide who obtain an elective abortion experience negative and persistent psychological distress afterward studies find higher rates of psychological stress depressive substance and anxiety disorders as well as suicidal behaviors after an abortion procedure as compared with other reproductive events of concern is that the current theory and practice which promote abortion to relieve the stress of an unwanted pregnancy do not reflect the new evidence of post-abortion stress or de-stress i'm one of the 30 percent i've also been raped and stalked but because of my abortion i struggled emotionally with self-hatred guilt shame and anger for over a decade because of my choice murder for hire is very hard to live with i want to give you some quotes of the women that i've worked with right well your time is up can you just give us one or two okay i don't think i started it after i read hers but anyway go ahead we'll give you a few extra minutes okay another extra minute um i've had several clients that consider themselves murderers um they don't just kill a baby they kill a part of you choosing to have an abortion made me question my character according to webmd baby guide understanding conception it does say that life begins at fertilization the fact that a pregnancy is unplanned or unwanted does not make it less of a human being and it's very hard to live with when you've made that choice when it hits you in the face when you hold your wanted baby right after delivery and they put that your baby in your arms you flash back i've had many many women tell me this i did this myself what did i do what in the world did i do here's the thing i'm not sure and i know this this is for life at conception and i believe that's when life begins but is it is it as much about when life begins or the right to have the convenience to do what we think is the best thing to do at the time i don't think that we have the right to make those decisions so i believe that any vote for yes is stating that you willfully choose not to acknowledge the current science and technology standards of this day thank you thank you miss coats representative eskar has a question thank you madam chair and thank you okay this is hard to see us thank you so much for being here today and for not only sharing your personal story but for sharing the stories of some of your clients as well it was while you were discussing the way your clients just describe themselves that got my attention and i really hope that these women when they come to you and are telling you these things that the the caring pregnancy center is equipped to be able to help these women with their mental um their mental health and it was quoted it was said before earlier that you all merely refer these women out to another person when they're coming to you saying these things i feel like these women may be coming to you in a crisis moment how do you react to that i actually just have this coats i'm sorry that's right go ahead thank you madam chairman sure i actually do have a master's in counseling and biblical counseling and um and yes they do sometimes come saying those things that is not how they leave we have a um a study that we use and it is it's an 11 week study and we go through the grieving process and they are allowed to grieve with purpose in a safe environment with um so that they can heal so that they can not think of themselves in that way so that they can know that they are forgiven if they believe in god most of them do some not all do but most of them do but ultimately it's so that they can forgive themselves we do also have she's in a um it's in our parking lot but she is not associated with us and she's a lpc and a certified play therapist who accepts medicaid so any of the ladies that um that do decide to parent can can go to her all right uh representative no no more representative clinton thank you madam chair and thank you for your compassionate testimony and your care for those in difficult situations before you is a photograph taken from a medical book of a 17 week old fetus sucking its thumb do you believe this is a photograph of a human being yes i do thank you represent valentin thank you madam chair um you cited a statistic about women being coerced could you repeat that please miss coats it's called unchoice.com what was the i'm sorry go ahead what was the um percentage of women you felt 64 percent unchoice thank you all right seeing no other questions thank you so much for your testimony and for your patience uh linda petcash good evening linda um i think it's evening now um could you state your name and who you represent and your testimony please thank you my name is linda petkash and i am here representing myself over 30 years ago i found myself pregnant and unmarried i was divorced with two daughters and barely making ends meet i couldn't imagine how i would support a third child and marrying the father was not an option the only option i could see was to seek abortion services and so i went to the clinic in boulder they confirmed i was pregnant and i met with counselor the counselor asked why i was seeking an abortion and i shared with her my reasoning and then she affirmed my reasoning and proceeded to explain the procedure as she explained the procedure she used the term tissue throughout the entire discussion i was sedated during the procedure and went home to sleep the rest of the day however upon waking in the morning i was deeply convicted to the bottom of my soul that i had killed another living human being i was not just ridding my body of some unwanted tissue it's interesting to note that those two daughters have had six miscarriages in trying to have their children and during after each one of those miscarriages we grieved we did not grieve tissue that was lost but we grieved a baby that was lost i didn't tell a soul about my just my abortion for over 27 years except for the man i married about 29 years ago but yet within the last few years i have been given the strength to share my story with my family and as i have shared that with daughters sons father sisters i discover that abortion has reached further into our family than i ever knew that they ever knew and abortion does affect the father um i i heard a male relative cry and cry out in anguish my abortion decision brought me great shame guilt self-condemnation but it is but for the grace of god that i was healed of all of that i deeply believe that life does begin at conception and should be cherished and protected by the laws of our state and our nation thank you miss patkash and does anyone have any questions for miss petcash representative buckner thank you madam chair i don't have a question i just want to tell you how sorry i am for you know the grief that you've been through but um are you a believer i am a believer and what i want to say is i'm a woman of faith as well and even though we may differ on this um you will see that person again if you will and i do believe that thank you thank you are there any further questions thank you very much for sharing i think we have one more person that i missed that is opposed so let's see if he or she is here um what did i do with that one i know i saw it maybe not there was comic someone comic yes i'm sorry i misplaced your name uh do you want to come on up tell us who you are and who you're representing leslie right leslie yes go ahead tell us who you are and who you're representing if anyone my name is leslie comic and i'm here representing the league of women voters of colorado and excuse me while i just bring up yes there it is our position on reproductive choice is to support an individual's constitutional right to privacy in making reproductive health decisions we are against this bill because we think it's unwarranted government intrusion into the most private aspects of women's lives including the choice of birth control and we had that discussion earlier we think that also think this would be an unconscionable use of the criminal justice system it's an attempt to confer de facto personhood on the fetus and this is not to say that we don't think a fetus is human or is not human we're referring to legal personhood this measure would not end abortion it would just send it underground and that is harmful and punitive to women i've heard a lot of talk or we've all heard talk this session about lean government please let's not make it mean government thank you thank you miss comic are there any questions for this witness representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair thank you miss colemak before you as a photograph taken from a medical book of a 17 week old fetus sucking its thumb do you believe in your opinion this is a photograph of a human being miss comic thank you madam chair sir with all due respect i am here representing the league of women voters and we do not have a position on when life begins and so i must decline to answer any further questions representative lontine thank you madam chair and thank you for being here today does the league have any kind of position on this bill as to whether or not this might criminalize miscarriages that there might be some sort of investigation towards women or their doctors if she miscarries ms comic thank you we don't have a specific position on that on the on criminalization per se but within our overreaching um or overarching position we believe that it would uh that would not be a good thing that it would be unconstitutional um to do anything that would impinge on a woman's right to make her own reproductive health decisions and that would include the threat of criminalization all right seeing no further questions thank you very much for your patience and staying around thank you all for your patience to listen to all this long testimony thank you um all right rick thielen good afternoon if you could tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone hi i'm rick thielen i'm ceo of life choices we're a multi-site pregnancy medical center in northern colorado glad to be here thank you for inviting as i mentioned i'm part of a pregnancy medical center a multi-site here in northern colorado and we are here in support of this bill we do believe very strongly that life begins at conception and there is a scientific fact for that i won't get into that since i'm not a scientist but however i want to talk a little bit about why we do what we do first of all as women and men come into our center they're in the middle of a tornado of emotions and thinking everything of their life is ending their careers their college education all of those kind of things and what we do is we sit down with them very patiently our advocate court our advocates do and take them through and say your work your life really isn't over let's take a look and see what's going on and we talk about them but we create a situation or an atmosphere that is non-manipulative non-threatening it's safe and most of all it's no cost to any of our clients but the other part of it is is that we we share truth with them we don't try to force them any one way or the other because the fact that it's no cost we don't gain or lose anything based on the decision they make or in some other cases people profit from a decision that they make or maybe even uh coerced into as one of the other people testimony about 64 percent of the people felt like they were coerced but we do care and we do offer that that out there we take care of the people that come in we also work with hundreds of churches in northern colorado which represent tens of thousands of people that are very much pro-life and all very much go where that life begins at conception and i think it's interesting we had some questions come up about is this constitutional and one of the things in the constitution is that we have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and i think the order of what those are put there is very very important because there is no liberty and there is no need for pursuit of happiness if you don't have life in the first place and so that's why we're all about life now the reason we believe that life begins at fertilization is because within the first 20 excuse me within the first 20 hours of fertilization all the there's all the chromosomes and all the dna ends up being there that's going to make that complete person it doesn't add or take away as that person comes along and the point is it becomes human in which everybody said that's a human fetus which by the way fetus the latin is young one so everybody has agreed that this is a young human being and so the question when it boils down to when everything's said and done if you believe this is a human being then you have to ask do they have any more rights or any less rights than someone that is older and it all comes down to the is all comes down to the age the size the development and the location and i don't know if there's anything a constitution that defines rights by by those four things all right thank you very much um mr thielen are there questions representative eskar thank you madam chair and thank you for being here today i have just a few questions my first one is you say life choices is a medical center and i see that you give pregnancy tests ultrasounds and sti testing i just wondered what other medical medical procedures you offer as well and if that how many physicians you may have on staff mr thielen thank you uh we do we we do operate under a physician and we also have rns we are a limit we offer limited medical services and you name what those are pregnancy tests ultrasounds sti testing we also will hand out prenatal vitamins for those that choose to continue on with their pregnancy representatives thank you madam chair and then you mentioned that the services are in fact free and my question is if these services are free how are you how are you all funded mr thielen thank you we are funded by donations and it come from individuals it could come from businesses it could come from churches and so they're the ones that underwrite everything that we do um i just had a question so when you do the when you do the counseling with the individuals that come in do you uh include in that the option of abortion or do you do not give that as an option mr thielen good the bottom line comes down whenever someone comes in pregnant they have there's three options for them and we share that with them they can choose to parent they can choose someone else to parent or they can choose to abort but i think when the truth i think the truth in conversation comes in is when you have the conversation about what are the ramifications of those decisions you make and what's going to be better for you and honestly we we prefer that they would choose life they don't always do that and then they choose abortion and but we're also we care for them we love for them because we know that at some point in time they're going to have to deal with with the choices that they made there and they come a lot of times we see them come back it could be years it could be months you know it could be weeks even when they come back as what lisa was talking about for the post abortion care any other questions thank you very much for your testimony and your patience um cheryl bolton if you'll introduce yourself and tell us if you're here representing anyone good evening my name is cheryl bolton i am a nurse and i'm here with life choices and also myself all right so um excuse me um my question i guess is do all human beings have an equal right to life or do humans only become valuable later after they acquire certain characteristics excuse me my throat's dry from sitting here all afternoon but did you pass one of those out i'm just have a couple of images to share with you that i'll talk about in just a couple of minutes so i contend that there's no morally or scientifically significant difference between the embryo you once were and the adult you are today yes it's true that we're all a columbus cells human clump of cells from conception to this day size does not equal value embryos and fetuses are less developed than you and i but again i don't understand how that's relevant are newborns or infants less valuable than their older siblings the unborn are not already human and valuable merely changing their location can't make them so thank you i'm sorry take your time if viability bestows human value then all those who depend on insulin or kidney dialysis don't have much value humans have value simply because of the kind of thing they are not because of some acquired property they may gain or lose during their lifetime part of my responsibilities at life choices is to provide ultrasounds to confirm a pregnancy establish viability and estimate gestational age of a woman's baby i've provided you with a few examples with the ladies comments you know when a couple takes a pregnancy test and it comes out positive she says i'm going to have a baby she knows it's a baby so in your first ultrasound sketch that i gave you is six weeks four days these are all images that i've taken i've done probably a few thousand ultrasounds of pregnant women and these are the things that i see all the time and the comments that i hear regularly so when a woman looks up at the ultrasound and she sees a heart beating she says that's my baby's heart beating it's not a clump of cells beating it's her baby and she knows it's her baby at 10 weeks or 8 weeks after fertilization the baby's brain is producing 250 000 neurons a minute if it's a baby boy he's already producing testosterone when when this ultrasound came up this mother looked up and said and she this was her quote omg my baby's blowing kisses at me and it was at a live a little over 11 weeks this mom saw her baby kicking legs and arms she could count fingers and toes it was waving doing flip-flops and she said i can't believe it my baby is peeing already it's a baby in conclusion women and men recognize that the clump of cells they see on ultrasound is a baby yes we're all a clump of cells from conception to now but that clement clump of cells is a human being sadly abortion extremists believe that human beings that are in the wrong location or have the wrong level of development do not deserve the protection of the law we can do better than that in the past we used discrimination on the basis of skin color and gender but now with elective abortion we discriminate on the basis of size level of development location and a degree of dependency we've simply exchanged one form of bigotry for another miss bolton your time is up and thank you that was just thank you perfect timing thank you madam chairman you bet thank you for your testimony uh representative primavera thank you madam chair and uh my daughter is a nurse as well and so i was just curious um since this bill talks about um you know they're a human being or a person from the time of conception since you do ultrasounds if somebody conceived last night could you pick it up on an ultrasound no oh excuse me thank you madam chairman and thank you uh representative primavera no we could not pick that up on ultrasound although it's very small that's a question that i that i bring up is because something is small that we can't necessarily measure it does that make it less valuable representative primavera thank you man i'm sure so when can you pick this fetus up on an ultrasound miss bolton thank you madam chairman and thank you representative primavera we can start seeing the pregnancy sack a little over four weeks we can actually detect the heartbeat a little over five weeks thank you representative eskar thank you madam chair and thank you miss bolton for spending the day with us um my question i i just didn't catch did you say you were a registered nurse thank you madam chairman and thank you representative eskar yes i am a registered nurse i've been a registered nurse for over 30 years representative veskar thank you madam chair and have you ever worked with a physician that delivers babies ms bolton thank you madam chairman and thank you representative eskar for the first several years of my nursing career i was a labor and delivery and a nicu or neonatal intensive care nurse and we spent every ounce of our energy to save every little 300 grand baby that we could represent thank you madam chair um it's my it's my understanding that this bill the way it's drafted if one of those doctors had to help a woman who was having a miscarriage that doctor could potentially be charged with a class one felony if this bill passes do you support that ms bolton thank you madam chair and thank you representative eskar i did not write this bill and i think that the author would have to answer that question i'm not an attorney but certainly i don't think that anybody who does not commit a crime should not be held for that crime so but i'm not an attorney so i wouldn't be able to define that any further questions all right thank you very much miss bolton for your testimony and thank you all very much for your time you bet um so we have two more witnesses left uh representative humphrey uh did you want the one from ccf life to go last was that okay that's fine uh scott horik good afternoon mr horok can you introduce yourself and tell us who you're here representing if anyone go ahead thank you chair my name is scott horock and i'm representing myself as a citizen of the united states of america and all citizens united for life justice denied one unborn u.s citizen citizen is justice denied to all u.s citizens the undue burden of one u.s citizen does not outweigh the right to life of the other u.s citizen from preamble to the 27th amendment to the united states constitution the synonym for person is used interchangeably 126 times for united states citizen we all agree that not all persons are united states citizens but in fact that all u.s citizens are persons this colorado legislature will argue for another 49 years that non-person has no rights colorado has no right to argue that all unborn u.s citizens do not have the fundamental right to life guaranteed by our constitution we all agree that without the basic right to life there are no other rights there is no constitution there is no united states of america simsley stated there are only two past the u.s citizenship one by root and two by foot those who gain u.s citizenship by root do not have to be born to gain u.s citizenship they are already citizens by virtue of the roots of one or both of their parents all immigrants are required to gain citizenship by birth or naturalization naturalized by setting foot on u.s soil immigrants do not have the right to life guaranteed by the u.s constitution because they are not u.s citizens one by root two by foot with advances in cryogenics freezing and in vitro technology test tube babies renders all statutes legalizing abortion against u.s citizens unborn u.s citizens unlawful at any stage of life birth is no longer relevant to those who are u.s citizens by root the unavailable right to life is indisputable for those citizens manifested by root obviously no state can sentence a u.s citizen to death for crimes committed by another person roe v wade and all colorado pro choice statutes are moved to the light of unborn u.s citizenship there are no exceptions for an act of murder against any u.s citizen born or unborn i cannot imagine one incident that would warrant the decisions for an unborn u.s citizen can you if you can then you have to prove the perpetrator guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in compliance with due process rule of law equal protection of the law guaranteed by the u.s constitution make no mistake your vote today will go on record as either a pledge of allegiance to the constitution of the united states of america or you can choose to violate your oaths of office by the act of legislating domestic violence violence against unborn u.s citizens our nation will pray for amnesty for your crimes jesus will give you forgive you for your sins when you repent and turn from your wicked ways as for judgment of the unborn who have lost their lives to legislative choice and exception there is only a there is a special place in hell in federal prison for those who choose non-compliance and intentionally violate their oath of office to uphold the constitution in the united states of america it is your choice and our voice may be heard loud and clear by those unborn u.s citizens who have no voice one by root and two by foot and i apologize for running over and at this point i will shut off my camera and in the hopes of um answering any questions that you would have thank you mr horok um are there any questions for this witness representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and before i get to the standard question i ask everybody you raised this question about citizenship and i know there's been some debate in the press about who's a citizen what does the 14th amendment say equal rights for people who are born in america but in your opinion if this bill passes how would being conceived in america or outside of america affect one's citizenship rights mr hork thank you um thank you go ahead madam chair yes yes so that's a very good question and uh one that's been decided right now we have a a presidential election this year and if a president or a future president is born in another country are they a citizen of the united states of america yeah they are a citizen of the united states america if they are born by root now congress has the power to enact legislation to naturalize immigrants and that's it they don't have the power to take away citizenship from one that is by root and it's really clear in the 14th amendment of the art the 14th amendment article 1 of the united states constitution is perfectly clear when it commands no state shall make or enforce any law so which shall abridge the privileges immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law in order to die to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the law and this is this is clear this is clear representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair before you use a picture from a medical book of a 17 week old fetus sucking its thumb in your opinion is this a photograph of a human being mr hork thank you madam chair obviously it looks like a human being um and we can argue that it may not be a person and it may not be a citizen of the united states but if it is a citizen of the united states it is a person and it has the very basic right to life guaranteed under the constitution of the united states of america so if that is a person that's fine but it isn't a citizen of the united states until it's born or naturalized in the united states and it doesn't have the right to life but if it is a citizen by root it i guess it depends on who the parents are of that child in that picture if they are u.s citizens that child is a u.s citizen from the very moment of conception and that's because of cryogenics and in vitro fertilization when we have the technology now and we do it to have a grandmother have her daughter's child in a foreign country that's the tech that's hard to wrap your mind around okay a grandmother has her daughter's child in a foreign country but the daughter is a u.s citizen the grandmother is not a u.s citizen but she's born in let's say china that that child is a u.s citizen by root and we don't have the right to kill it but china would have the right to kill it because it would violate their one law one child policy oh now it's to child policy all right thank you are there any further questions for mr hork seeing none thank you so much for your patience uh today and for your testimony thank you all right we have one more witness signed up to testify christie rodriguez come on up and let us know who you are and if you're here representing anyone good evening i'm christy rodriguez i'm representing colorado campaign for life and before i get started i hope you don't mind i just want to address representative clinchment yes i do think that is a child fetus human being unborn so thank you thank you answering the question before he asked it yes go ahead please excuse me time and again you've heard women testify that they've had emotional trauma after experiencing an abortion you've heard how difficult it was to have an abortion and my question is why because there is something deeply disturbing about harboring a crime scene there's a horrible shame knowing your womb a place where life should be created is actually a tomb place where murder has occurred at your own behest in fact representative buck buckner just assured our testifier linda up here that she will someday see that person again when she was talking about her baby that she aborted you've heard an expert witness that deals with broken women broken by the fact that they've had abortion and abortion or abortions but maybe that's our problem right we shouldn't have gotten pregnant in the first place at least that's an impression i get from pro-abortionists on this committee and testifying in favor of abortion rampant and for any reason for at any stage but for many women the decision to abort their child seemed acceptable by the mere fact that it was legitimized by roe v wade in fact i speak to many women who have had abortions and i always ask them if they had had if they would have had an abortion if it weren't legal the answer is always a resounding no abortion law that is roe v wade is really the opinion of nine supreme court justices an opinion or a belief that is upheld at least in this body by you abortion advocates who should be instead creating laws for the benefit of people for the benefit of women but the law you cling to that is the legalization of the intentional killing of unborn children as we have seen today is harmful to women and deadly to children i humbly ask you to put your personal bias aside and take action to stop the senseless harming of women and the brutal killing of unborn children and support the life at conception act thank you very much ms rodriguez are there questions for ms rodriguez she already answered yours representative clinton schmidt so seeing no further question no questions thank you so much for your patience and staying here all afternoon thank you that concludes the witnesses who've signed up to testify regarding this bill are there any other people in the audience that would like to testify tonight all right a handout oh i saw her earlier this is a very heavy stack do you want to let's have you identify yourself again and and identify what you brought so we can go sorry yes i'm christy rodriguez and i'm with colorado campaign for life and i brought you a very heavy tote stuffed full of petitions of citizens of colorado who are pro-life and are supporting representative humphrey's life and conception act okay great i promised them i would i almost forgot thank you thank you very much wait we got a question here representative klingen schmidt yes thank you madam chair i i received about 100 or so emails to this week in opposition to this bill but i'm just wondering if you have a rough count of how many petitions you're presenting to us in that big bucket there in support of this bill is it more than a hundred is rodriguez thank you madam chair yes it's more than 100 but honestly i have to look at my computer to count it's way more than 100 i can obviously see that but i would really have to look in my computer to be absolutely positive thank you representative clinton schmidt you can start counting them if you want yeah yeah why don't you just just teasing it's clearly over a hundred quite a few um all right is there anyone else in the audience that would like to testify seeing none the testimony phase will be closed oh before i do that we did get a statement submitted to us in writing from aaron robertson so just so the record's clear we did get that each member got that statement and that is a statement in support of house bill 1113. all right the testimony phase will be closed um now we'll move to uh the possibility of amendments for the bill um representative humphrey do you have any amendments that you would like to suggest i do not madam chair all right is there anyone else on the committee that has an amendment seeing none the amendment phase will be closed all right we are at the point where um we will make comments before we take final action on the bill uh but we will give miss uh i think representative clinton schmidt was concerned that i let people comment before he got to comment so would you like to comment first representative humphrey or do you want to wait till everybody else comments um thank you madam chair um i i don't really have a closing remark i think that we've heard excellent testimony um in behalf of the bill um and you already noted that uh aaron robertson of the patriot league um submitted this um letter in support so um i hear gennady vote on house bill 16 11 13. thank you all right are there comments from members of the committee okay let's start down at the end representative lontine thank you madam chair you know my maiden name begins with a y so i was always used to being last so it's hard to get used to being first but thank you um i i want to talk about what's happening at my house um i have a young son he's now 21 and when he was 18 he and his girlfriend came to me and his father and his girlfriend's father and announced that she was expecting a baby and so their choice was to have a baby and so they did and um everyone on this panel who knows me has heard me talk about my grandson probably to the point where they wish i would go away and they've seen all the pictures he's a beautiful little guy and i adore him dearly i guess the bottom line of where i'm going with this is that what they did was their choice and for me that's the bottom line of what i see here is that this takes away choice and women have the right to control their bodies and so what i see here is an attempt at taking away the right to control or a one for a woman to control her own body in her own life and that's what this is about for me and i feel and i've always been taught that one of the founding principles of our country is that we have the ability to choose for ourselves and to control our own lives and this takes away from that choice and for that reason i will be a solid no today thank you representative primavera thank you madam chair well i uh as i've said before this is a really tough issue for me i went through 16 years of catholic education and my kids have gone through 20 years of catholic education so i just i know one of our witnesses talked about the abortion advocates on this committee and i just want to make sure people know i'm not an abortion advocate if i could wave a magic wand and never see another abortion i would be happy but there's a couple of things actually four things in this bill that i can't get past i can't get past the fact that there's no exemption for incest or rape with the work that i've done with crime victims because it raises the question about whose life is more sacred the fetus or the the victim themselves i also wonder about the implementation of this bill with the hipaa laws that we have i'm not sure how anybody would find out if a dnc was performed or something like that so i'm not sure it's really even implementable and then the final thing that i can't get past is it's my understanding with the class one felony not only would the doctors be potentially facing life in prison for performing a service that someone asked them to perform but they got off but it's my understanding that they could also receive the death penalty so again it raises my question about whose life is more sacred and so i will be a no vote representative ryden thank you madam chair and i'll be brief um it seems to me that what i was hearing from most of the women who came forward and regretted or had a lot of serious issues after they had had an abortion they all had a choice to do that and i it appeared that they all had safe choices and for me if this bill should pass it would take away that opportunity for other women not only to just have a choice but to have safe choices and i think that when it comes to this sort of situation our job is to ensure safety for the women and so i will be opposing this bill representative buchner thank you madam chair first of all um the dred scott case was brought up and you all know what that is and if you don't google the greg dredd scott case but if you're gonna use that case get the facts straight dred scott died in 1858 he was a slave his case was argued in 1856 and it was decided march of 1857 so if you're going to use this case get the facts straight also this case was unanimously and universally denounced as the worst supreme court decision and the court's greatest self-inflicted wound so just remember that please i'm a compassionate person and i'm a passionate person and i am a woman of faith and i comforted the lady back there because that's the kind of person i am i also believe in freedom of choice i believe that i know how to make the best decisions for me so i am definitely not in favor of this bill and then last of all this bill has been brought up for four years in a row and although i was not here my husband was here previously and i want to read to you he was a former for those of you who don't know my husband was a late john buckner and he unfortunately passed away and i was voted in to take his place and when this case came up last year some of you might remember this but i'm going to read it again he said this is the third time we have heard this bill since i have been in the legislature meaning my husband he said i have resisted the temptation to respond to the comparison between abortion rights and slavery because it's a as he would say a relatively intense topic with me slavery is and in one which i don't display appropriate levels of tolerance for alternative points of view this case keeps coming up i need to tell you this that a systematic no i'm sorry as a systemic classification of entire classes and races of people with the tactical support of the government and social morays of that time is an intensely different situation than individuals making choices about their own health decisions so this decision about a woman's health and comparison between slavery and determination of her own health seems to me at best fringe and at worst another slap at our history of intolerance in this society that's what my husband said and i totally agree with that and i want to add to that slavery is repugnant but to use it in this context is unacceptable and unfeeling so just remember you've brought this bill up several times now you've used that dread scott case unfortunately in a way it should not have been used so i want you to remember that and want to thank everybody who came to testify and with that i'm going to close thank you very much representative eskar thank you madam chair in thank you for that buckner i made an observation today when we first started the hearing i was really surprised at the number of people in this room i i really expected the room to be packed because this is such a compassionate driven passion-driven bill on either side and i started thinking about it why were there less people here than i expected to be here and i honestly believe it's because they are tired why do we continue to spend time debating a bill that has been defeated by the voice of the people and like it or not is the law of the land we should be spending our time here at the capitol on policies that actively support women and families in colorado not harm them or criminalize their doctors the people of colorado have spoken time and time and time again i will be a no vote once again this year representational thank you madam chair and thank you representative humphrey for bringing this back again and i guess i have a few things to say as a reproductive endocrinologist i've taught embryology and i have issue with a zygote and someone saying that it has a brain and circulatory system a single cell or even uh the division to four cells or uh blastula gastrula on to multiple cellular systems doesn't have any of these until um many weeks after conception i also question the fact that uh you're changing that definition of pregnancy from implantation to fertilization it doesn't make any sense to me i believe in a woman's right to choose and i always will and i think a lot of the bills that i bring forth in this in this house um and under this dome are for choice um and this is one that i think uh a woman always needs to be able to make that choice it's her body and it's between her and her doctor you know i lived through times when um hearing stories when abortion wasn't legal and they are horror stories and i'm sure every one of you have heard similar stories so i'm because of time i'm not going to get into that i don't want women to have to go through those times again if this bill would pass and i would never criminalize physicians or women because they make a choice and it's their choice to make and that's what this bill does so um i just want to say that in closing that i believe that this is a woman's right and it's between her and her doctor and i will be no vote any other comments represent blandgraf thank you madam chair i really have nothing to comment on the bill but i would like to comment on the process when when i started here we had training and we were told and trained that witnesses will come before us and that they have the right to say what they want to say we may not like it we may find it offensive but that's their right and i think we saw something here today that was um uncomfortable for some it was probably uncomfortable for all of us i still don't have any clue how abortion and slavery were connected maybe i wasn't paying close enough attention but we are not responsible for people who come to testify we are responsible to listen and be respectful and i don't think that was done today representative uh let's see we'll go down the line representative joshi thank you madam chair and thank you representative humphrey for bringing this bill as a physician i know that when the life begins and when life ends i have been through those experiences also growing up in india and we heard from some folks about different religious beliefs and all that yeah we believe that their life begins and the unborn child can learn a lot of things as a matter of fact now we even have scientific evidence and people are now making their unborn babies listen to music and things like that as a matter of fact in our culture we even make sure that the mother eats the right kind of food because we believe that what kind of food you eat that's how your baby will turn out to be too i mean it's maybe a little far-fetched but we even believe that so i am with you on this but at the same time some of the things that went on today kind of bothers me too because uh again we try to listen to our constituents our witnesses and we try to then decide accordingly yes we do keep bringing some bills time after time it's not just on our side everybody has done that because you believe in something and you want to [Music] also help your other constituents who believe in similar ideas and you bring the bills accordingly so i don't think there is anything wrong bringing a bill time after time we have seen and since i have been here i have seen some of the bills where people had voted one way and those bills were brought and eventually they were also voted the other way so that's not the wrong thing to do that's what we all do here and that's why we are elected but so with that i'm with you i will vote yes on your bill and thank you for bringing it represent ransom thank you madam chair um 20 plus years ago i had an unplanned pregnancy i was not expecting it i can remember looking at that stick going oh dear lord what am i supposed to do now i recognize that legally i had a choice that does not negate the fact that there was a living thing inside of me that had brain waves and it had a heartbeat by the time i saw that stick it already had brain waves and a heartbeat we measure death by the cessation of brain waves and a heartbeat therefore evaluating whether there's a life or not by brainwaves and a heartbeat i think is a very logical thing to do from a scientific basis and i'm talking about the science part of this not the faith part at this moment um that child actually is now in her 20s she's a productive citizen that pays her taxes she contributes to our world i'm very glad i had her my issue is that i don't think it was a cosmic coincidence that some of these cells some of these fetuses are in some women and some in another woman and it shouldn't be life or death for that fetus slash baby slash however you want to define it based on who his or her mother happens to be therefore um i listened to all the things about choice and i read about that and i do remember roe versus wade passing and i recognized the whole choice issue but at the same time a person's a person no matter how small just because they're tiny doesn't mean they're less they're less valuable they're just inside versus outside um and we're defining that then it's okay to to kill it and if it's something that's growing it's alive by definition it and they do grow um let's see a planned parenthood brochure back in 1963 and i quote an abortion kills the life of a baby after it has begun end quote that was in a planned parenthood brochure they got it they understood that there was a baby there and that it kills the life of that baby obviously i'm going to be a yes vote on this but i would like to just encourage people to think about the location part just because it's inside versus outside if you can see it versus she can't see it there's still value there and it's still a baby and i'm done i'll be a yes vote representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and representative humphrey and thank you especially for your patience with me uh not just madam chair but everyone on this committee you heard the same gordon question over and over again and you by now you're thinking why does he keep asking that but i'll tell you what i learned today i learned that obviously there are differences of opinion on what this is a photo of some people called it a baby some people called it a fetus some people called it a being the bill says it's a unborn human being or unborn child but i also began and those are all differences and if you have one set of views you think it's okay to kill it if you have another set of views you think it's not okay to kill it okay that that's where we are in terms of our differences but you know what i look what i saw today and what i discovered and maybe you'll see this with me is that we all all of the witnesses had one thing in common and there's a silver lining here which could pave the way for future discussions where we could all agree and they all used one word to describe what this is a photo of human they all agreed that it was human even the nayral representative who was discussing the tweet which was sent out about the doritos ad about the super bowl said oh showing an ultrasound humanizes a fetus but the nayral representative today and correct me if i'm wrong they said this is a human fetus and so i wonder if maybe next year if you plan to bring this again representative humphrey if instead of defining unborn human being because there seems to be dissent about what the word being means you just strike the word being and say it's an unborn human and i bet you will find unanimous support because every one of the witnesses today said this is a human and it's our shared humanity that gives me hope that there will be a resolution of this discussion in the future i will be in i vote today uh any further comments um i'm just gonna make a brief one and then represent humphrey if you want any further wrap up you're welcome to do that um so first of all i want to thank everyone for their patience it's been a long afternoon um we had to continue representing klingon schmidt's bill which caused us to be here late but i think uh everyone has conducted themselves with respect and i just want to thank those of you who have stayed late with us uh i will be a no vote on the bill um i think it's been a really enlightening and interesting discussion and i appreciate your opening statement representative humphrey about listening and hearing the other point of view and i thought you expressed that very well and explaining your point of view obviously we have some different differences of opinion i think that to me it's um maybe we'll be ending earlier than we thought there we go our trusty sergeant to the rescue um thank you duane so anyway uh you know it bothers me the idea that we would make medical care a class one felony and subject our medical personnel to the possibility of life in prison for doing something that they view as part of their obligation as medical professionals and i also agree with it's been well expressed the the concept that this is really a choice that a woman and hopefully in consultation with whoever conceived the child with her uh makes personally this we heard a lot of testimony about how difficult this decision is and people go either way is something that each women woman and her partner decide with their doctor what's the best course for their own life and so for that reason i will be a no vote so do you have anything further to comment representative humphrey thank you uh madam chair um uh you know i would just say you know i think that you know again that the crux of that issue is that we're talking about a human how to say human for gordon right now um and we have to remember that you know what are we talking about and we're talking about our humanity when we talk about that and we're we're talking about a decision made based on the size the location the environment the degree of development of that human being and yes it would have wide ranging ramifications a bill like this but i think the science supports it and i think that it is the morally right thing to do and i think we're we're pushing about 60 million abortions in this country um i don't know when we're gonna hit that anniversary but that's coming up um 320 or so million people in this country so at that rate with the compositionalist committee i guess we'd have like two or three of us that wouldn't be here um you know which which two or three would that be and um i don't think that's okay and all right would you like to move the bill representative humphrey i will thank you ma'am chair i move house bill 16 11 13 to the committee of the whole second with a favorable recommendation favorable recommendation well i've been told it has to go down okay so get this right i move house bill 16 11 13 to the uh to a probes with a favorable recommendation seconded by representative klingenschmidt right ms king could you call the roll representative brown yes represent buckner no representative esgar nope representative humphrey yes representative joshi yes representative clinton schmidt yes representative landgraf yes

IVKM7dp8s1Q,CO,03-11-2014,representatives conti absent everett here no here joshi here nangra here mccann absent shafer here singer tyler here wilson here young here madam chair here and representative conte is here as well the first thing we have on our agenda today members is a presentation by ncsl on child support enforcement and representative singer just joined us as well so are the ncsl presenters here if you could join us at the table all right you can introduce yourselves and decide who wants to go first great thank you for being here sure thank you madam chairman members of the committee my name is rochelle finzel and i'm the director of the children and families program with the national conference of state legislatures and this is my colleague megan mccann she's a policy associate with us the national conference of state legislatures is a bipartisan organization that serves all 50 states the legislators and staff in those states and the territories and our mission is really three-fold we really work to improve the quality and effectiveness of state legislatures we promote policy innovation and communication across legislatures and we also represent a strong cohesive voice for states at the federal level as i mentioned i'm with the children and families program at ncsl and we cover a lot of the policy areas that fall under the jurisdiction of human services committees so we do work on child care and early education policies child welfare and foster care we also do a lot of work around welfare and income supports for low-income families as well as the topic that we're here to discuss today which is child support so what i want to talk about today is just kind of give the basics of child support programs and how they operate talk a little bit about where colorado fits in kind of the national context and spend really most of the time talking about the shifts that we're seeing across the states in terms of the focus of child support programs and where their emphasis lies and and some of the legislative trends so child support is a really important source of income for families and especially those of lower incomes for some poor families child support can mean 40 to 50 percent of their annual income so it's a really important financial support one of the other things though that a recent census bureau report found is that a lot of non-custodial parents not only provide cash support but non-cash support as well so there's both that cash and non-cash component so the way child support programs work all states and territories do operate a child support enforcement program and their roles are really around locating parents establishing paternity establishing and modifying the orders so the amount of support that the non-custodial parent is obliged to pay as well as collecting and distributing those payments enforcing support when there are cases that don't pay and another larger piece of their job nowadays is around referring non-custodial parents to employment programs and helping them find jobs which will then enable them to earn a living and make their child support payments so those are kind of their basic functions and there are the way that the states are funded it is a federal and state cost-sharing mechanism so states pay for the services and the federal government will reimburse the state at 66 percent there are also federal incentive payments that come to the state for reaching certain performance measures so for colorado about 27 million is spent of state dollars the rest is federal about 5 million of that is actually incentive payments for reaching those performance measures and those performance measures around paternity establishment collection on orders as well as a cost cost-effectiveness ratio that they're required to report so that's how the how the program is funded and the major tools that states use to collect child support vary from you know basic income withholding to suspending driver's licenses there are criminal non-support penalties as well colorado definitely gets the bulk of their collections through basic income withholding the way that the program was started and this kind of leads into the conversation about the changes that we're seeing in the states in 1996 when the federal government passed the welfare reform act there was a lot of policy requirements for states to implement enforcement provisions to set up guidelines so that everything was you know being distributed and established fairly and it was around welfare and so a lot of the recipients of welfare have to assign their rights to child support over to the state so if a family is receiving welfare and the non-custodial parent pays the child support then the state actually keeps that amount to reimburse them for the cost of that public assistance so in those early days child support was really looked as a cost recovery system for the states and states were able to recoup the cost of public assistance and so there was for for many states it was it was a revenue generator that has changed as the welfare caseloads have dropped obviously there's not as many families receiving welfare so therefore those cost recovery dollars are not as high the other thing happened in 2005 with some of the the deficit reduction act changed some of the focus to look more at evidence-based strategies on what encourages and incentivizes non-custodial parents to pay there was a lot of discussion around fatherhood programs and how to engage fathers and other non-custodial parents with the family and also looking at this notion of of helping them find employment that that was that was another issue that was brought up so what we've seen states do is really kind of change their strategies from being just kind of a collection agency to looking at this as being a service to the whole family a lot of states are looking at ways to intervene early so that child support debt does not accrue that's a big problem others are really using data to try to drive their decisions and target their strategies to families there's also more of a customization i think going on in terms of really looking at each family as a separate unit and trying to figure out what what works best and as part of that really building a more positive relationship with a non-custodial parent so that the child support agency is not looked at as the collection agency but as a friend and someone who will help them be able to make their child support payments so there's definitely been a shift and in the last few years there's been some research on really what works the evidence-based strategies that increase the likelihood that non-custodial parents will make those payments and there is a handout that lists those five strategies and so i'll just kind of go through them a little bit give you a sense of where colorado falls so the first is right-sized orders and that just means that the orders are based on actual incomes that it's not something where uh the order is based on either an imputed or a default amount like some states will just use minimum wage 40 hours a week if they don't have any other data that may or may not be an accurate reflection or set up an order that the parent is able to pay so looking at ways that states can really make sure that those orders in the beginning are set so that the non-custodial parent can pay the other area is debt reduction there in nationally there are over 115 billion dollars worth of uncollected child support and in colorado that number is about 1.1 billion so there's a high number of non-custodial parents with large arrearages and high debt so one of the areas that states have looked at is tweaking their policies and their ability to be able to either forgive or compromise some of that debt it's not a blanket you know let's just settle this there are eligibility criteria and other requirements that non-custodial parents have to meet usually the arrear just have to be pretty high they have to set up a consistent payment plan and comply with other requirements that the department sets forth and so in colorado as with most things here a lot of that then goes down to the counties and the counties can determine how they may or may not offer a debt forgiveness program and there are there are sort of conflicting opinions about that because for some state directors it's looked as being just too lenient that you're letting these folks off that this is legitimate they owe this support to their child um and others do see it as a way that at least they get something from the parent if they're able to come up with a payment plan and address that that debt the other issue that we're seeing more attention actually four states have legislation on that right now is around family distribution so as i mentioned in the beginning the child support program was looked as a cost recovery money generator to reimburse the state for the cost of tanf and other public assistance benefits with that kind of shifting so in a sense the non-custodial parent is paying the child support but that money goes to the government and what they've found is that parents are more likely to pay if that money is being distributed to the family so this issue around family distribution and making sure that the child support actually gets to the family is also something that's kind of gaining more traction in the states so about half the states offer what they call a pass through so then the state is able to pass through a certain amount of that child support payment to the family and then they may retain a portion and so about half the states do that colorado does not but there are about 25 states that that offer a pass-through most of them it's 50 some it's a hundred and some of it it depends on how the configuration of the family the other two areas are really getting at this notion of using child support i think to really reach out and work with non-custodial parents and try to encourage engagement in the family's life and and with the with the child so parenting time trying to make sure that that there are some orders you know the custody and visitation issues are addressed the census bureau report found as well that the likelihood of payment increases if there is some sort of a joint custody agreement so it plays off one another that parents are more likely to pay if they're involved in their children's lives and if they're involved in their children's lives then they're more likely to pay so it kind of goes both ways chicken or egg kind of thing the other issue that we're seeing much more attention on and about 29 states or so actually have employment related programs that are tied to their child support program so this whole notion of trying to help non-custodial parents find employment which then obviously would help them be able to make a living and be able to make those child support payments so there's a lot more work with child support agencies working either with their workforce development programs in the state working with community-based organizations working directly with employers but really trying to connect non-custodial parents to jobs definitely with the recession that's been more of an issue where states are seeing that the parent wants to pay but they can't because they're either unemployed or underemployed so this is another thing where states are really looking at beefing up their collaboration with child support agencies and employment services and all of this kind of fl follows along with the legislative trends that we're seeing where not a lot of this or not all of it has to go through legislation but there are certain states that are either requiring some job training programs as part of their child support obligation others are looking at the enforcement measures like with driver's license suspensions instead of just absolutely suspending those drivers licenses for not making payments they may allow a provisional driver's license so that they can at least go to work so they're starting to make those connections between what what really will help parents be able to make those payments and the other area we're seeing a lot of involvement with states and legislative action is custody and visitation specifically around military families and colorado has already adopted the uniform military family deployed parent act but it really is trying to address those unique needs of military families especially when it comes to custody and visitation when they're deployed and how those orders are set and what happens when when the parent is deployed and of course we always see different statutes change and tweak around implementation administration of programs so i think in summary one of the things that were at ncsl watching and this is what we do is really track what's going on in the states is is seeing this sort of shift in terms of looking at child support not just as a cost recovery program and not totally tied to the welfare system but that it really is about helping families and ensuring that that financial support is there for for the child and colorado is doing some very good things along those lines uh colorado just received a federal grant to implement an employment program for non-custodial parents so there's a lot of work being done your performance measures you meet where the national standards are i wouldn't say that there are some areas that that there may be for improvement but for the most part colorado is doing a lot of good things and is on the forefront but i think part of what states are doing is really leveraging these child support programs to be more than just a collection agency and i'd be happy to answer any other questions representative landgraf thank you madam chair and he's nicer than that thank you for very much for being here uh your timing couldn't be better and i will give you a call later about that i had several questions if i can read them well first of all you talk about income recovery so i know at least in el paso county if a person isn't paying their child support the child doesn't receive any child support they don't you know the county doesn't pay it and then recover from the parent miss pencil right that is correct representative that if there is no payment coming from the parent then there is no payment okay so website land graph i wanted to ask about the driver's license um so how exactly does that work because i i know i don't think it works i mean if a person isn't paying and they haven't paid for a year they in theory should have their license suspended ms spencer manager representative landgraf that is correct i mean the statutes are such that and the rules allow the agencies then to suspend revoke the driver's license of the individual that's not paying and again this is where we're seeing some tweaks in the legislation that it's not a hard and fast rule perhaps there are some there's some wiggle room allowed for people who do need a driver's license in order to get to work there are others that are you know just still tightening those rules around driver's license suspensions but indeed it is it is a an enforcement tool that that states use represent land grab thank you now i may have forgotten my question oh the you talked about the process whereby a state settles a portion or all the child support debt and i just wanted to make sure that i'm clear on this it's the child then that loses that support it's not the state and i think you answered that with my first question when when a debt is settled the custodial parent and the non-custodial parent agree to you know a portion of what's owed or okay am i right there miss pencil madam chair yes if the debt is settled not only is it that the state because it is state-owed debt so the state does lose but the child also would then not receive those payments as well okay representative land grant i think this is the last one perhaps oh two more madam chair um you talked about underparenting time research shows so my question is not where you say non-custodial fathers who pay child support are more likely to stay involved and then those who aren't involved don't pay the the numbers the numbers are you know there's a correlation those who pay stay involved those who don't pay or those who aren't involved tend not to pay so what is my question i guess i really don't have a question or whatever it was i don't remember it so i apologize but my last question madam chair the the two states that created the task force can you tell me which states those are and which states in your opinion have the best laws on this entire subject mr schinsel madam chair that's a very good question in terms of the two task forces it is connecticut and delaware that created those and they were really to try to get a better understanding of what works and how they can increase their collections and decrease those arrearages because like i mentioned there are a lot of states with pretty high amounts of child support debt in terms of the best states ncsl doesn't necessarily talk about states in that way i think if you look at it in terms of high performing states pennsylvania always ranks very high in terms of the performance measures and based on the federal standards and there are other ways i think to evaluate who's doing what and i think what we're seeing is that there are pockets of innovation texas does some really great things with their non-custodial parents and the employment piece new york also has an employment program california has been doing some interesting things around using data to try to drive their decisions and targeting their strategies there are a number of states that are doing certain pieces but i'm not sure that there's one state that's sort of doing everything okay thank you very much representative conte thank you madam chair quick question you talked about welfare recipients are going down is that on a colorado level a nationwide level or both and what is the source for that stat madam chair in general caseloads have gone down from the beginning of welfare reform and there were a number of families on welfare i don't have the exact number off hand but now we're only at about 2 million families across the country so in general those caseloads have gone down almost in half since the welfare reform in 1996. there has been some fluctuation in the last few years with the recession some states saw some their caseloads go up given the economic downturn but it wasn't across the board either representative stevens did you have a question as well yeah thank you uh i think this is a crazy one here yeah um i wanted to ask about the pass-through fee uh the i think did you say 50 was it i mean in other words pass-through fee does it stay with the state is that for the purpose of just an admin or are we talking about something where we continue to move to receive child support or we work in that area what's up the pass-through fee that you spoke of miss pencil madam chair representative stevens the pass-through is actually so if a family is receiving public assistance and say the child support amount is a hundred dollars right now under the federal rules the state can retain all of that in order to repay the state's costs for paying the welfare benefits or they are allowed under federal law to pass through some of that money to the state to the to the family so that pass-through amount is what will go directly back to the family as opposed to the state keeping it to repay itself for welfare benefits so if so if the say it was a non-custodial or a custodial mother and she got a hundred dollars in child support and she was receiving a 200 cash welfare benefit the state can retain that one hundred dollars to repay towards that two hundred dollar payment that's going out in public assistance but the state could also pass through that money directly to the family as well for cashback the data would show that the non-custodial parent is more likely to make that payment if they know that money is going to the family instead of the government so that's kind of the argument that is for passing through those dollars to the family certainly yeah and and my other question would have been on the means-tested program then because there's all different kinds and again it would apply back to to that so makes sense actually but i just hadn't heard was there admin fees estate charges or any of that you know i mean it's a that's quite a bit of work really is on pass through yeah representative young thank you madam chair thanks for being here and your handout is helpful i notice on the back under the parenting time that you actually give some results of the of a study in 2007 but then i looked at some of the other bullet points and there was references to some of the demonstration projects or studies and i'm just wondering what were the results of those or is there a place we can go to learn more about those and see what those results were manager absolutely and we actually have more detailed information that i'd be happy to to send you that show some of the results of those projects good thanks representative wilson thank you madam chair and thank you both for being here on the bullet point the cost effectiveness collection cost ratio where does that figure come from madam chair representative wilson that figure is actually basically the ratio of how much the state spends and then how much the state gets back in collection so for every dollar that the state spends on child support enforcement activities they are collecting four dollars and 20 cents representative wilson thank you madam chair then quick follow-up then the total administrative expenditures of 77.8 million are those dollars reimbursed at 66 percent miss pencil madam chair yes so the 77 of that 77 about 27 is state actual state the state share and then about 45 is the matching and then about five million dollars is incentive funds thank you representative did you have a question thank you madam chair it's on a slightly different topic than the finances of this but i really want to thank you ncsl for um addressing the needs of children for fathers and a male role model i i'm in my sixth year here and i've heard about all the challenges for teen mothers single mothers unwed mothers i don't hear very much about teen fathers single fathers unwed fathers and it almost seems that we don't hold fathers as responsible as we could by not offering them some incentives that you are really trying to do and i really appreciate finally seeing uh some real attachment and incentives for the the fathers whether they're teen single or unwed to have that relationship with their children and i hope that in the future that we will see more reports like this that really address teen fathers now i know there are some counties that have fatherhood programs and maybe my county jefferson has one but i really think we need to start thinking of all the ways we can incentivize children having the custodial and the non-custodial parent rewarded for their engagement and whatever financial support they might be able to provide all right we have another presenter to hear from no i'm just you're just here for support backup okay are there any other questions for our presenters i was out of the room did you get a chance to finish your presentation i did okay thanks all right seeing no questions thank you very much thank you today okay uh representative mccann is here as well i don't know if uh representative young mentioned that but um first first item on the agenda is uh house bill 1192 with representative joshi it's for action only and i don't think the bill has been moved and i think maybe representative jose would like a little bit of a wrap up perhaps okay representative joshi do you want to take a few minutes and remind us of what your bill was about thank you madam chair and committee members from where we left last time this is the bill to repeal the health insurance exchange we heard quite a good testimony from both sides during the last meeting and there were several questions mostly they were about the money and if how much money was spent how much if we have to give back to the federal government and so on and so forth uh and there have been several news items also since we had it and in one of the other committee we also were able to talk to the executive director was here on that audit committee bill so we got few more bits of information and i had also asked the physical analyst to be here and he is back there so some of the questions we had he is willing to clarify too so do you want to move the bill first or you want to have him come first we can have mr denovellis come i don't know if he has a list of the questions we had or if members need to ask them again madam chair members committee dave denovellis legislative council staff i don't have an exact list but if anybody has questions i will do my best to answer them are there any questions for mr denaulis maybe i can madam chair one of the question was um and this had come up from some of the presentations that we had heard from the exchange that they had spent 187 million dollars um apparently uh ms fontenot clarified that that they that is the grant awarded but they have only spent 80 million dollars right now and i might have mr uh denalis uh kind of clarify because he has actually studied uh this in depth mr novelis madam chair members of committee uh so the amount that the uh health benefit exchange has been awarded uh since 2011 is 177 million uh they had 18 million uh an 18 million grant a 43 million dollar grant and most recently 116 million grant of that one is what they have spent 80 million dollars of so they still have roughly um 35 million or so from that most recent grant left over and how it works they don't get a just a big check for 177 million they have a authority to go turn in invoices to the division of payment management within the department of health and human services so they take an invoice turn it in grand money gets drawn down for that so that's how that works they don't just have a large sum of money sitting in a checking account okay any other questions represent young thank you man i'm sure so my question is if we were to pass this bill we would then require everybody to use the federal exchange and then the money invested to stand up the state exchange through the website would basically be lost money am i capturing that correctly mr donalds madam chair uh representative young uh some my opinions yes uh what what would need to be happened due to uh the affordable care act is that uh the state would be then required to connect to the federally facili facilitated exchange uh and to do that uh the estimate on that is about 1.2 million dollars just to just to hook up in we believe it would be you know 2015 2016 after the exchange was repealed thank you for the follow-up and so then would we be on the hook to pay back the money that we spent on the state exchange mr denovellis madam chair there isn't an exact amount however the health and human services grant policy statement it does allow it does allow the federal government to administratively recover funds and that's according to uh the federal federal regulations it doesn't say you know the amount or what it is but the grant policy does list allowable costs and i checked in there it doesn't say that transferring any money any grant money to the state fund would be an allowable cost so any of that that happened there might be some discussion about what money was transferred into the state fund based on house bill 1192 and there is some precedent most recently in baltimore that hud had asked to recover uh roughly nine million dollars of what they have said was misspend funds exception of county um thank you madam chair i did i heard a recent report that the healthcare exchange had a recent update meeting saying that we were about 114 million people short of the goal that had been set forth can you confirm or deny that i hope that's in your bailiwick mr dedonlis madam chair representative conte i would leave that to the health benefit exchange to talk about enrollment numbers currently okay are there any other questions for our fiscal analyst representative joshi thank you madam chair so as we were talking the federal government only comes after the state if the grant money was misspent or misproportionate or in some other way in other words it was not used properly in this particular case because everything has been dictated by the grant by the federal government we have pretty much followed by their requirements so far to set up the exchange mr novice madam chair representative joshi uh as far as i know the federal government has not uh come back and said that any of the uh grant funds that have been already spent have been spent inappropriately all right well thank you for being here um okay so i guess we're ready for action on the bill so representative joshi if you would want to move your bill the correct motion is to the it's just for action only we already closed the amendment phase right you can do amendments at this statement oh okay do you have amendments no madam chad i have no amendments okay amendment phase is closed okay so to move your bill the correct motion is to the committee on health insurance and environment it was duly assigned so if you'd like to move your bill madam chair i move uh house bill 14-1192 to the health insurance committee second hey house bill 1192 has been moved and seconded um are there any comments from the committee before we take roll representative stevens well thank you madam chair and um thank you representative yoshi and i know that we um kind of held this bill um for me uh to come back to vote because i was out that day we had a few others so i will not disappoint representative yoshi i can certainly um appreciate uh you're trying to run this bill um i think however and the reason why i will be in no vote today is because and and for the rest of my colleagues that signed on to this um i think you need to take note if you're going to come to this committee and you're going to have this kind of um right you know recommendation there needs to be a strategy with it there needs to be a strategy behind it there needs to be something to point to the state what we need to do in case we talked about moving then to a federal exchange i think if you were to put that before the voters we might all be surprised at the outcome of that and i think that in the future if if these are going to come forward and i'm not saying the health exchanges is moving at a clip i think it's great that we're going to have a performance audit on it i think we need to see where this exchange is going to be coming down the road and what it's going to do i don't mind that at all but come here and to say to repeal without any other kind of strategy for the state any other health care ideas just in my mind is indefensible and i say that to you and i say it to the rest of my colleagues you come to this committee you want to repeal something you better have an idea in place because the market demands it the market the people that employ people who get health insurance the people that need health insurance employers and small employers who want to know what in the world to do we would have to work together then to get something on the table and so uh with that rep yoshi i'm going to be a no today and and really i do believe if we are going to do things like this we need to have very formulated ideas and working with the industry and working with business then to make sure one has an alternative uh so thank you and uh madam chair will be a no vote okay are there any other comments representing blangrah thank you madam chair and rep joshie i i appreciate you bringing this and i understand what you're trying to do i think we've got basically a very failed system with the affordable care act we have a system here that um i don't like any better but i think it is keeping us it's kind of a safety net keeping us from a worse fate i really haven't decided yet i know my constituents um i know where they stand they're they're against all of this i'm against all of it but i tend to agree that until we have a better plan this may be the best thing we've got at this very moment so i think i'm well i'm still undecided but you'll find out in a few minutes [Laughter] representative wilson thank you madam sharon thank you representing josie for bringing this quite frankly i was fascinated by the debate um we heard people both in favor of it and against it they thought it was the greatest thing in the world thought it was the worst thing in the world um so i believe we need to check up on what quote unquote we did um so people can now afford insurance but the question is can the government and that's a question that we have here unfortunately i think here we have the mindset that if i voted for it it has to work and that's why i'm for sunset that we go back and look at that and see unfortunately around here i've noticed in a short time i've been here we don't tend to follow up on how things are working except for government agencies that come and report to us and tell us how good that they're doing which maintains their program their livelihood so believing in sunsets believing we need to review it and because the debate encompassed both sides of that issue i think it's a debate that we need to carry the house floor and see if there's something we need to be doing to improve the conditions that some of these folks that testified here said are not working for them so i will be a yes vote i think it deserves debate on the floor okay are there any other comments representative schaefer thank you madam chair all right representative joshi i understand the health benefit exchange is not perfect and i don't know if and when it will ever be but i understand there are about 90 000 more coloradans that do have health insurance that did not before the headlines of the denver post this morning talked about millions of americans so they're getting you know some kind of health care uh through their state exchange or a federal exchange so i think it's moving in the right direction we're moving the ball down the field as i've heard quite often this session that it's not perfect but it's moving in the right direction so i will respectfully be a no on your bill any other comments representative joshi yeah thank you madam chair i will be making the closing statement in that case um members thank you very much for giving me this opportunity actually it was very interesting that since we heard the bill about two weeks ago a lot of more stuff has come out in the news some of them locally some of them nationally one of the things that just came out about a week ago in denver post which was very interesting and it was kind of buried in the article in the middle of it we kept on hearing that this was formed so that we won't use any general fund money and it was all going to be more or less as a private and many members voted because of that but i don't think we were told everything truthfully because the article basically says that somewhere between 11 and 13 million dollars of the general fund has been used for this exchange and this was already in denver post this is not my research this is denver post research so this has been kind of an issue all along and now we have found the truth number two we are hearing that many citizens got the insurance well if you put up subsidy and taxpayers money you can prop up anything actually the most recent number shows that this subsidy is going to cost us one trillion dollars over the next 10 years we already have a 17 trillion dollar debt now we are adding another trillion dollar to that debt just because of subsidy not about the insurance or anything this is only subsidy then on top of that i think it was yesterday's denver post another article because we keep hearing that the premiums are cheaper was this article mentioned about that some of the premiums are actually higher than what these 300 000 coloradans who lost their insurance may be paying actually more through the exchange so and then we don't even know what percentage who had gone through the exchange actually have paid their premium so we i mean there are a lot of answers which we don't have and then on top of that we also know that most of the exchange insurances have much higher deductibles even if you go and talk to doctors and we heard that during the testimony they haven't seen any of these patients yet so they don't even know what kind of patients will be coming whether they are not coming because they already know that deductibles and co-payments are higher these were the people who couldn't afford it in the first place so i don't know if they will be able to afford to see the doctors even though they have an insurance it's like you buy a car but the gasoline is so expensive that you can't even use the car because you can't put the gasoline in your car so these are the many issues and maybe we were not told or maybe the people didn't know the answers at that time what this exchange was it should not have been started in the first place and now we also know that we don't have to pay all this money back what we thought earlier that it was 180 million dollars maybe we have to pay it back i hadn't had a chance to go through the whole grant approvals that has come back i have received the copy of it it's over 100 pages long so it's going to take me a few days before i will go through it what are the conditions that federal government has put on us but we'll find it out i have planned to read it definitely because i'm not giving up on this thing so in short i'm saying that this is something that we were not told truthfully to begin with and it's not working and then yesterday i saw another the federal government is now investigating one of the exchange i believe it's in maryland because they haven't performed well so they are going after them and the inspector general is starting the investigation so this is just the tip of the iceberg that's going on nationally so i don't know where the exchange our exchange will fall into which category uh whether it's good or bad or it's working so i think right now we really have to stop wasting our grandchildren's money because this money is not colorado money of course there was about 10 or 11 million may turn out to be colorado money but majority of it is going to be our grandkids money and how they are going to pay whatever 17 18 trillion dollars that they will have to pay so anybody who got grandkids needs to really think back uh that whether they want to continue to waste their money and when we are kind of old i'm already a grandpa so i have to answer my grandkids i don't know how many of you have to and i don't want to go ahead and tell him that i wasted your money so that's one of the reason i'm bringing this bill let's cut our losses now and move on and let's start to see what we can do so with that i'm asking yes mort thank you representative joshi representative stevens did you want to make one more comment yes thanks madam chair um madam chair just for the record uh i i actually since i was a majority leader when we passed the spill actually the public and our legislature was told absolutely everything up front about this bill we've had a legislative oversight review of this going on steadily from the moment this bill was passed with i think colleagues of really the highest ethical standards and representative bob gardner being one of them and uh and also uh i actually to give credit where credit is due to the team that put it together um they've already been under two to three federal audits have passed all of them so if anyone wants to insinuate that anything less than honest or anything less than the um less than transparency has been going on here um i really take offense to it and i really think not only the record won't prove that but i do think it's important um for the record uh to note that the colleagues on both sides of the aisle that have been part of this oversight have vested and weighed very carefully as to what's going on with this and so um i would like that for the record and uh and that's why i mention it thank you thank you okay well we have had a really good discussion on this bill and um representative joshi uh from the memorial this morning i have to say that i admire your passion for this issue but i also agree with representative stevens about the fact that we really don't have anything to replace it with and so i will be a no vote today as well so miss berger will you please call roll representatives conte yes everett yes janelle no joshie yes landra yes mccann no shaffer no singer no stevens no tyler no wilson yes conte hail to the alternate universe yes young no no five to eight that fails five to eight representative joshi is there another motion representative young uh thank you madam chair move to p.i second second okay the motion to postpone indefinitely has been made by representative young seconded by representative schaefer berger will you please call roll representatives conti no everett no janelle yes yoshi no landgraf no mccann uh yes schaefer yes singer yes stevens yes tyler yes wilson no young yes and i'm sure yes that passes eight to five thank you thank you come indeed okay the next bill on our agenda is senate bill 62 by representative foote and representative gardner if you would join us at the table please tell us about your bill i don't know who wants to go first thank you madam chair i'm pleased to be here with my friend and colleague representative foote to bring uh uh senate bill 62 to you the reinstatement of the parent-child relationship i think there is a fact sheet uh out there and uh we will go over that between the two of us but i want to say that when i was first approached with this bill um i said well wait a minute i i need to know more about it and then as i uh learned what the bill was about realize that this is good public policy this is good family policy uh what the bill is about is that we have many many cases in our state where the parent-child relationship is terminated due to problems primarily with with mothers but mothers and fathers substance abuse mental health criminal justice issues and that's as it should be for the best interest of the child but there are instances and cases and they are not many but when they occur they are important for those children and those families where reinstatement a re-creation or a re-making of the family ought to be available this bill creates a process by which a parent whose rights have been terminated can have those rights reinstated under limited conditions just because they meet the statutory eligibility requirements does not mean that reinstatement will be automatic it will be up to the court to determine the best interest of the children or of the the child the criteria uh just to review them briefly are if uh a county department of human services uh child's guardian ad litem or the child uh him or herself if they're over the age of 16 can file a petition to reinstate uh if and these are the the criteria the child is 12 years of age or older if younger than 12 part of a sibling group and that becomes important uh that would include that child there's a consent by the child and parent the child has no legal parent at that point so there's been there's not been an adoption the child is not in an adoptive placement not likely to be adopted within a reasonable period of time other permanency options for that child something more permanent and more stable for that child has been exhausted the child is in the custody of of the county department of human services so in other words they are being overseen by the state the final order to terminate the relationship is at least three years before or less than three years the reinstatement is in the best interest of the child um and that this is very important the prior dependency and neglect action that terminated the relationship did not involve a substantiated allegation of sexual abuse or an incident of egregious abuse or neglect and near fatality suspicious fatality or near fatality there is a process an initial hearing a trial period and final hearing we can address more fully if if you would like to do so what this provides is an option for joining the family once again and it is as i say an important option it is not one that is going to happen very frequently but when a child and a parent meet those criteria we as a state ought to be able to do that and it is good for families good for our communities it is good public policy i asked for an i vote and would ask my friend and colleague to expand on that as he wishes thank you madam chair and um thank you members of the committee for hearing this bill i i appreciate the opportunity to carry it with representative gardner and um appreciate that so far this bill has received uh good attention it came out of the senate unanimously and and it's i think it's just a an excellent bill to address those few cases per year where reinstatement is a is a viable option i don't think there's any anticipation it's going to be more than a single digit number of cases at least that's been the experience in the 13 states that already have this kind of procedure so um i i don't want to go over everything as as usual representative gardner was thorough in his explanation the one thing i just want to highlight was when i was looking through the proposal and when we were narrowing down the language and deciding what language to use the one question i was always thinking about is or the one thing i was thinking about usually was uh how can we be safe how do we have the appropriate safeguards on this because the the initial termination of the parental rights happened for a reason and we want to make sure that if there is reinstatement that um we're not putting the child in a situation that could cause further harm to the child and i believe that this bill does have those safeguards and addresses those concerns um obviously representative garter went over to the i think briefly the the fact that the the court will be involved there will be a hearing there has to be evidentiary standards met um the judge ends up making the decision about whether or not reinstatement is appropriate here um it can only happen if it's three years or longer after the termination other than a good cause clause that's in there but generally you're looking at three years or more after the after the termination of the parental relationship the parent must go through a thorough assessment and the assessment has to come back positive the assessment for example has to say that the child would be returning to a safe and stable home and that the problem or problems that initially caused the termination of the relationship have been addressed and have been solved if the initial relationship was terminated because of sexual abuse or egregious abuse or neglect or near fatality then this is off the table completely no matter what the circumstances are three or five or ten years later so it's just not an option and also i think it's important to to mention that um this would be the case if of course the child wants it if the parent wants it and there'll be other professionals in the system that will be guiding the courts and giving their opinions it'll be the department of human services the guardian ad litem and if the court then determines that this is in the best interest of the child and there should be reinstatement then there'll have to be a transition plan that that'll be up to six months where it's kind of uh i don't know if i'm this is going to be the right way to put it but try it before you buy it type of thing where the child goes back and there's either limited um living arrangements or or whatever the court determines so if it's just not going to work out after four months of the six months then the reinstatement is off so there'll be i think a lot of a very important court oversight and a lot of professionals involved to make sure that this is something that's in the best interest and that we won't be putting the child into a situation that we shouldn't be so with um with those safeguards i felt comfortable on bringing this bill and i hope that you will also be willing to support it thank you are there any questions for our bill sponsors representative wilson thank you madam chair and thank you both for bringing this in the 12 states that have utilized this what's their curiosity what's your percentage of success or whatever i mean are those single digits do the largest percentage of those remain in that household representative um thank you madam chair unless representative gardner doesn't answer that question i'll have to say i don't know but there are folks here from the department of human services from boulder in denver that may be able to answer that question representative wilson let the record show i stumped two attorneys i've never done that in my life [Music] congratulations that was your only motivation all right i represent gardner i think i heard you say that the child has to be 16 years of age but it's 12 is that correct maybe accurate wrong i don't know uh let let me let me read the criteria um the child him or herself can petition if over the age of 16. okay and that's not perhaps an unusual situation um but until they're 16 the child him or herself could not petition so the child has to be over the age of 12 or if younger than 12 part of a sibling group so that it's uh maybe a 13 or 14 year old and a 10 or 11 year old great thank you okay are there any other questions okay um you have uh let's see one two three six witnesses signed up to testify did you have any particular order are they all supportive i can't tell on one it does she's not checked one way or the other so you want the supporters first we don't have any particular order okay so we'll have roberta long twyman come forward first hope i pronounced your name correctly correct and if you would state your name and who you represent please and you're the person i didn't have checked for or against on the bill so yes in spite of all my training and uh filling out forms sometimes i mess up i am roberta long-twyman and i'm here to testify on behalf of the league of women voters in support of senate bill 62. i'm a retired child welfare worker of 23 years on most aspects of the bill we are in agreement because it would give children an additional avenue to permanents outside the child welfare system and this is a very important part of a child's upbringing that he needs to know what he can depend on outlined in the bill are strict criteria that families would need to to meet in order for children to be returned and the agreement of both parties is important our concerns and we have some concerns that no one has mentioned are that after the six-month transition time there's no provision in the bill for ongoing services many of these children have received therapy for many many years including after the termination was completed for children who have spent three years in foster care after termination plus the time that it took to prepare the termination there may well be significant emotional problems that cannot be resolved during the termination during the transition period a provision for some services to be provided on an ongoing basis would be appropriate examples might be ongoing medicaid for the child to receive psychiatric service including family therapy on an ongoing basis or a stipend so that the family could afford to get therapy or medical insurance for the child and those are our concerns thank you are there any questions for miss twyman sing none thank you for your testimony today our next witness is pat ratliff if you could join us at the table state your name and who you represent for the record please thank you madam chair members of the committee i'm pat ratliff representing colorado counties we are in support of this legislation and have considerable expertise among county directors and staff who've worked very hard on this bill so i'm going to be very brief because i look forward to hearing from megan davis sarah ehrlich and a number of the others who've put a great deal of time and energy into it when i first see the this bill i freak out it's come before us any number of times over the years and this is the first time that it's been crafted so well and so clearly focused on protection of the children but an interest in reunification this is an incredibly difficult thing to balance and this bill has done it i also believe reading down on page 10 starting with line 25 and going on through the next four or five subsections it looks pretty clear that the child's status with regard to benefits or anything else is not intended to change as a result of this reunification so i believe that answers the previous witnesses testimony while there's nothing that directly says that what you will see is that without regard for whether or not this order is granted the situation with regard to the child is essentially the same there's no responsibility for child support for the parents it is clear that the intent is to protect the child under the original case that was brought and it does state that of course i'm looking at an ipad so i'm lost but trust me um and and you've got all this time wasted law school who seem to think that it does that as well so madam chair i will conclude my statements as worthless as they may have been and take any questions you have but we do have expertise here are there any questions for miss ratliff thank you for being here today okay benjamin waters if you could join us at the table state your name and who you represent for the record please uh madam chair uh representatives gardener in foot my name is benjamin waters i'm here today representing the mile high united way and the foster care and adoption agencies of colorado both of both of whom are in support of this legislation we'd like to point the committee members to the provision in the bill that outlines these services a foster youth is currently receiving and these services they might lose if they reinstate frontal rights just so the um the foster youth is understanding of what a action of reinstating parental rights would take for them we ask for that provision because a lot of our youth have passed through our bridge in the gap program um um do actually uh use a lot of services and we wanted to make sure that it was in the best interest of the child some situations it'll be best for them to to remain on their own some situations it's going to be best to go back with their parent and so that's why we view this bill as another tool in the toolbox that'll help kids in this very specific situation and we'd also again like to thank the bill sponsors for the dedication of this important issue i'll take any questions if you have them thank you are there any questions for mr waters sing none thank you for being here today sarah ehrlich and megan davis who wants to go first i'll go first okay if you could state your name and who you represent please good afternoon madam chair and members of the committee my name is sarah erlick i'm the legislative liaison for denver human services i want to thank both of our wonderful sponsors and also the bill drafter who worked so hard with us during the fall to craft this legislation senate bill 62 reinstating parental rights is about putting families back together as many families deserve a second chance the bill allows for the re-establishment of the legal relationship with the biological parent that is in the child's best interest the eligibility criteria and step-by-step process for the court to consider are outlined in the bill including the transition period back into the home counties and stakeholders have discussed this bill concept for three years and have done extensive research into other state statutes and procedures in order to vet the concept thoroughly we respectfully ask for your support on 62 and if i may i could probably answer two of the questions that have come up or statements from previous testimony as mr waters mentioned there is a section on page 9 line 25-27 we are to advise all parties in the case about the benefits a child may gain or lose if they should transition back to the home so that goes both ways if you transition a child back into the home perhaps the family would be able to get on tanf they would be able to get medicaid up to age 26 but again if they are set up to go into an independent living situation they would no longer need that if they're going to have their rights reinstated and then the other piece was on page 11 at the top if the parent child legal relationship is reinstated the court may require periodic reviews within 90 days after reinstatement so we are not just dumping a child back into the home we are doing a six-month transition period and then we will have follow-up reviews as needed so we would be able to address any subsequent issues such as therapy if needed and you can still provide services on a voluntary basis to a family some of the great legislation that has passed around child welfare in the last few years has allowed us to do more of that representative thank you madam chair if there is an allegation of sexual abuse but there's no finding so the person terminates prior to any findings nobody really know would they mr early thank you madam chair representative blancraft actually a lot of that may show up in the dependency neglect file so you may you may have a record of that okay but if reps in a bland graph if if it didn't and there is no record then the person would be uh the child would be able to go back to that parent because because there are really no records of that is early thank you madam chair of representative landgraf i think if there's no there's no record of any statements by either a party i don't know how we would ever know that i think that's sort of your point but unless it's brought up at some point throughout the dependency neglect case it would be very hard for us to know that and keep in mind this child is still in the custody of the department so they could have come into the system when they're two they could have said something when they're 10 and so then it would end up in the file and we would know that before we would have the ability to reinstate at 13 or 14. does that help alleviate your concerns no thank you all right any other questions representative young thank you madam chair and i'm sorry i was out of the room briefly and so this question may have been answered and if it has then you can just tell me it has and i'll figure it out later but when you come back and you reassess readiness to go through this process are you doing the reviews is there a a standard process that's already in place to do that review the original assessment and then these reviews that are done to make sure placement is right that the process is correct or is that kind of done on a case-by-case basis i'm just trying to understand how that's done to ensure that this is really the right thing to do mr early um representative young i think what you're referring to is something that we call the safe assessment so that's sort of the standard process outlined in the regs for how we do home studies and assess whether any home you know in a normal adoption for example would be an appropriate placement is is that what you're referring to representative young yes thanks hey it's davis did you want to you madam chair members of the committee uh my name is megan davis i'm with the boulder county commissioner's office i'm a policy analyst and i work on human services issues and i would also like to thank our sponsors representative gardner and foote for running this bill as sarah mentioned this has been a priority for boulder county and many other counties for several years for us in boulder county it was brought to our attention when we had a casey family foundation assessment of our child welfare system and we really looked at some system changes that we could make to improve things on the front end in particular in the child welfare system and that is how to work with families as they come into the system on reducing out-of-home placements and concurrently we wanted to look at how we could address issues on the back end of the system or in particular for those youth who were in the system and searching for permanent place placements and maybe sort of bouncing back and forth between foster homes and really having a hard time at that age finding permanent placements so we along with many other counties established permanency roundtables and the permanency roundtable is an opportunity for a multi-disciplinary team to come together and look at that that child again it's typically youth who are in the system and really do a deep dive into what relationships they have what relationships they have had they're looking at anyone that they have whether it's someone in the school system a clergy member a neighbor anyone to whom they can create kind of permanent relationships and establish permanent relationships and i'm also looking at of course family can and potentially their birth parents and so we i'm just going to give you an example as i think both representative gardner and foote stated this isn't something that comes about all the time but we had have had two cases in the last um probably five years where this is a tool that we would have used for a child who is in our system and one of the one of the examples was we had a child come into our system they were he was taken out of the home at the age of three and he was adopted at that time and then he presented back at the department when he was 13 and the adoptive family said this this is a child that we can't take care of and he's having a lot of trouble and we worked with them and they were not interested in um they basically brought him back into the system and he um was then under the custody of boulder county so we were in a place where we were kind of starting from scratch we of course had all the information from um when he was a child but really looking at all the relationships that he had and at that point we said well what what's happened with mom and dad and he was taken out of the family originally because of drug and alcohol dependency issues and he was the only child and at this point when he came back at 13 his parents had been sober for several years and clean and they now had two other children and they were interested in reconnecting with him and vice versa so we weren't able to reinstate the parental rights but that is an example of where this would be a tool that we would be able to explore the reinstatement so we hope that with the passage of this bill and that this is something that we'll be able to kind of have in our toolbox and be able to look at in these types of cases so thank you for your consideration great any questions for miss davis sing none thank you for being here today okay we have uh your last witness dorothy mullicius you may want to state your name correctly and who you represent please thank you madam chair and actually you did a great job dorothy macias i am the staff attorney with and legislative liaison for the office of the child's representative the lcr as we have known is a state agency that contracts with attorneys throughout the state in order to provide children with best interest legal representation in every single child welfare case that's filed within the court system otherwise known as a dnn ocr testifies in support of sb14062 and thanks the sponsors for bringing this important legislation as you've heard 1462 has been the subject of discussions stakeholder meetings investigations and research since at least 2011 and that's when i first became involved in the legislative process at the ocr over those at least three years colorado has conducted its due diligence investigating the issues looking at to what the other states have done in this with this legislation we've also our agency also went to a national conference and sat in on a session with a national speaker about this particular issue and that was a clinical professor from rutgers law school and that professor ultimately authored a law review article on this and also that one just i guess got published in march of this year just earlier this month and so we've been in touch with professor schlattlick over the years too and trying to again learn the lessons that everyone else has been going through in this state and also what her what her research has shown so what you have is the culmination of local and national efforts in trying to maximize the benefits from the lessons learned in other jurisdictions reinstatement of parental rights is an extraordinary step um limited to extraordinary situations so as everyone says it's most likely not going to be used very often but hopefully it will be used in those limited cases where it truly is appropriate first and foremost the provisions apply only to children and youth in current dependency and neglect cases so you currently have the court supervising a dnn case and looking at what is happening with that particular child in the case it only applies to those children that are have been unable despite sometimes extraordinary efforts and diligent efforts to locate a permanent placement a permanent family and it only applies to those limited situations where the biological parents or legal guardians have truly addressed the issues that led to the removal of their child or ultimately the termination of parental rights the dominant principle remains the child's or youth's needs health safety and well-being all of our discussions are trumped by the child's best interests so if we move forward and we learn that the child is going to lose some sort of benefit that they truly cannot get otherwise and that would be a factor in determining what is in the child's best interest in determining whether or not this is appropriate as part of my duties at the ocr i am also a practicing gal i still have a handful of cases and i am currently working with an 18 and a half year old young man who i think might be able to benefit from this legislation but frankly i'm not sure yet because it's still too too new so quickly he was taken into custody at the age of 12 temporary custody in 2008 his parental rights were terminated in 2009 and he has been a part of some aggressive efforts in order to find him a permanent home in fact every january he appears in the capitol here as part of the heart gallery we at one point had a potential adopted placement from out of state but investigation showed that that was not an appropriate placement for him in the meantime as this guardian delight him i have been hearing periodically from his biological mother and she reports back to me every so often trying to figure out how he's doing letting me know how she is doing in may of this year of last year excuse me she called me and she explained that she was on her own she had left the abusive stepfather that led to the filing of the dnn and that she had relocated to this state in june she followed up with yet another phone call expressing to me she would love to know what's going on with her child july she met with me and in november she came before the court in the dnn proceeding and subjected herself once again to the subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court she became a special respondent in the dnn case so far the department and i have been been out to her home a couple of times we've investigated that so far she's engaged in therapy with this young man and so far he's been able to ask her some really tough questions and why it is that she didn't leave his stepfather long ago and and left him to be part of this system um i'm cautiously optimistic we we still don't have enough of a track record where i would say yes we feel pretty comfortable pursuing this type of petition but if she continues on this current path if she continues to visit with her son if she continues to establish herself as an independent person and able to provide for him it might be a better option for him than ultimately emancipating to no one and you know as a professional we're trying to get him ready and prepared so that he does emancipate and becomes a productive citizen of our community but no professional is going to be able to replace that phone call in the middle of the night where it's like you know i don't know how to make mac and cheese can you help me none of us are going to be able to provide him with what a family would provide him with and again we're investigating all sorts of different options we found his biological family too in this process so they might be the permanent folks for him the important thing is is that sb 62 gives us those options we're going to have more options for him so that when it comes to the time in the future when it's appropriate we might be able to place them with biological family it might be reinstatement but at least we'd have that option so to say the least we're in favor of this bill and we hope that the committee will vote in favor of it also representative singer thank you madam chair and thanks for being here today um you know i spent a lot of time working with the dnn court and guardians that led them our life savers more more times than i can count um just back to representative landgraf's question to touch on that briefly about you know in the bill it states here that basically this would not apply in any situation where there was a substantiated allegation of um sexual abuse and i think representative landgraf's question was more about well what if there's an unsubstantiated allegation so there's been a report that's been made there's there's an allegation that's out there um and you know it's either unfounded or or inconclusive but it's not substantiated uh now there's there's all sorts of breaks that this bill puts into place it this isn't an automatic free ride for for kids or families or for anybody else um as a guardian ad litem is there a specific i'm trying to remember is there a specific amount of time that you are required to to have face-to-face contact with the children that you're representing madam chair and representative singer um yes there is a requirement that we visit with the child within 30 days of our appointment and also within 30 days of any movement of placement also we have to keep in touch with the child on a regular basis consult with the child before each court hearing and also to answer your question we do keep in touch with our children and our agency has worked pretty hard to drive that point down home to all of our guardians that line up representative singer thank you bad fear and so so i and just from my understanding of the bill and your understanding of the bill here there there are even even if if these proceedings were to start to reunify children and parents which i think is is always should always be our the first place we look even if it's not possible you would be able to put the brakes on and say hey judge or hey human services you know i know there was an unsubstantiated allegation but i've got a few more questions before it goes forward or there wasn't ever a report made but now i'm starting to hear something or now i'm starting to see something based on my contact with with this child that i it's my job to represent the best interests of miss macias madam chair and representative senior you're absolutely correct the guardians had let them have access to all the department's information we have access to um therapeutic information guardians that let them have access to of course the child and listening to what the child wants and what the child is able to tell us about what went on within the home and because of that relationship we often get a lot of information from these kiddos about what has happened and what the underlying what what the specifics of the abuse was that took place in the the home and what their trauma was that they experienced within that home so absolutely the guardian advice soul sole concern is the best interest of the child we don't respond to the department we don't respond to the court we don't respond to the responded parents we our sole duty flows to the best interests of the child and we have to zealously advocate for that represent a singer thank you madam chair last last question and i don't know if you've ever heard this anecdote but representative pabone sometimes talks about this is um his wife is guardian ad litem and there was a child not young enough to pronounce latin words and she called her guardian headline i'm a guardian of light so but it's probably a better better definition anyway but you are able to meet with children outside the presence of human services or any other adult is that correct thank you madam chair and representative singer yes and frankly that's best practice that we need to be able to meet with our with these children whose best interests we represent and completely talk with them freely about what has happened in the case thanks are there any other questions for this witness seeing none thank you for being here today and for what you do thank you that's uh the last witness who signed up to testify on your bill represented foot thank you madam chair if it's acceptable to the chair there is a letter i have here from the colorado criminal justice reform coalition and if i could just read the first paragraph they're supporting it but couldn't be here the colorado criminal justice reform coalition would like to ask representatives of house and human services to support sb 062 ccjrc believes that this bill is vitally important step in recognizing the reconstruction of families that have been devastated by personal problems such as substance abuse and or mental health issues and where the parent has stabilized through treatment and is able to resume parental responsibilities so they support and wanted to make sure that the committee knew that thank you okay so anyone else who's in the room who has not signed up to testify on senate bill 62 who would like to seeing none the witness testimony is closed are there any amendments on the bill okay the amendment phase is closed would you like to have any concluding comments representative gardner or representative representative gardner yes thank you i appreciate the committee's very thoughtful questions it is important to understand as i began this presentation that i had questions about how this would be implemented and the committee has properly focused on those as well it is not going to happen very frequently when we are able to do it and it is the right thing to do we ought to have the ability to do so representative landgraf has raised an important question uh we we've set boundaries about a whole series of things including substantiated uh allegations of of sexual abuse or egregious uh abuse that doesn't mean if you meet all the criteria that great you win there's reinstatement there's still a guardian ad litem there's still a need to show best interest of the child uh this question an issue that was raised about benefits is addressed in the bill because it may not be the thing to do and there still may be concerns even if the criteria are met and that's what the bill says this will never be a perfect process we are reaching a little closer to perfect by giving the state the ability to restore families when the facts the circumstances are appropriate and so we asked for an eye vote thank you representative gardner representative thank you madam chair and committee i would just add very quickly that there is a lot of discretion built into this bill and and when i say discretion i i i guess i'll say the ability to put the brakes on um if the guardian had light him or if other parties don't think this is appropriate or at the end of the day after hearing testimony or arguments the judge can just say no and um and these these things are built into the bill for a reason and if the if it turns out for example to go to representative landgraf's question if there is an an unsubstantiated allegation that still could be a no answer the judge can say no we don't think it's this is the right way to go because of this unsubstantiated allegation or the gal could say no there's lots of ways that it could be stopped if it turns out that that there's someone that determines it's not in the best interest of the child and and you'll see language in here to that effect that gives a lot of authority and discretion to to the judge and others to make that determination any other comments from the committee i had an employee once whose parental rights were terminated and she had had the substance abuse problem and once the parental rights were terminated she really told me she had no motivation to you know recover so i think this is great step forward for people like that who really do need a shot at redemption sometimes so thank you for doing this okay the correct motion is to the committee the whole representative young thank you madam chair i move senate bill 62 to the committee of the whole with a favorable recommendation second senate bill 62 has been moved to the committee of the whole by uh representative young seconded by representative landgraf ms berger will you please call the roll representatives county yes everett yes no yes yoshi yes landra yes mccann yes shafer yes singer yes stevens yes tyler yes wilson yes young yes temperature yes your bill passes 13 to zero congratulations thank you on the floor thank you madam chair thank you committee thank you representative mike okay the next bill on our agenda is uh you got a yes becker hospital 12 90. he's gonna go back to boulder potato okay representative becker will you please tell us about house bill 1290 thank you madam chair and thank you um committee this is house bill 1290 it's a telepharmacy bill so what what is telepharmacy telepharmacy uses telecommunications technology to provide pharmacy care to patients at a distance at a telepharmacy outlet a pharmacy technician prepares prescriptions for approval by a licensed pharmacist at a central site before approving the prepared prescription the licensed pharmacist uses telecommunications technology like a video conferencing equipment to examine the completed prescription for accuracy once the prescription is accurate the prescription is ready to be dispensed and the patient can receive consultation with the pharmacist via the same technology it's important to rural communities in colorado to expand access to pharmacy care many other states have passed telepharmacy bills including north dakota nebraska texas iowa connecticut kansas california vermont wyoming washington illinois missouri and montana i have a strike below that i believe everyone should have and i'll focus on that but i just wanted to [Applause] explain a little bit about why we're doing this i have a community the town of walden in jackson county that the closest pharmacy is about 60 miles away so from where we are right now that's practically driving to silverthorne to fulfill to fill a prescription so if you had to drive to silverthorne every time to fill a prescription you might not go as often as you should you might not go regularly to get that prescription filled and so this would allow small rural communities the opportunity to have a telepharmacy outlet looking specifically at the bill you'll see in the strike below we made a couple of changes one is to define what a telepharmacy is that was not in the first draft and the second major change is to take out any reference to who may own atala pharmacy previously we had language in there that said it had to be owned by a colorado licensed pharmacist and the chains didn't like that so then we put in language that said okay we'll leave ownership issues up to the board of pharmacy to determine and uh colorado medical society didn't like that so we just took out any reference to ownership so those are really the main changes and i'm happy to answer any questions thank you representative becker did everyone get amendment l004 on their desk this morning [Applause] okay all right are there any questions for representative becker representative schaefer i move l004 well i think we'd need to have testimony yeah we're gonna it's a strike below that's okay you can wait to the amendment phase so you can take testimonials but you can let the witnesses talk to you i think we'll we'll wait we'll let the witnesses testify to l zero zero four and we'll move it but thank you representative any questions representative becker representative young thank you madam chair and is the issue of ownership being out of the stripe below uh cause everybody to come together does it create additional problems that we we're leaving at neblet nebulous right excuse me thank you madam chair uh so we did reach agreement with all the stakeholders and unless there's a surprise today i think everyone is okay with the bill or supporting it actually so we'll find out representative wilson thank you madam chair and thank you representative becker for being here i guess my question may be the same as representative young's i was trying to figure out how is this going to look when someone opens one of these in walden where's the base going to be as i read the explanation which may have changed now with the strike below that the practitioner can't own or have ownership in it so they are hired help that are willing to move to walden to take care of this what's that going to look like for the facility and ownership of that representative becker there is um a speaker from the board of pharmacy who might be able to address that more specifically we just didn't specify who has to be the owner so if a chain wanted to come in and open a telepharmacy outlet there's nothing in our law right now that prohibits that and uh if you know the the issue about whether a practitioner can own a pharmacy is currently dealt with in existing uh board of pharmacy rules that do prohibit more than 10 percent ownership of a pharmacy what we decided is we didn't want this bill to be the the where that issue got fought out and so my understanding is if colorado medical society has members where they want to invest in pharmacies that's something they're just going to have to work through separately this bill notwithstanding does that answer your question representative wilson thank you manager not yet but i'll keep that on hold until i hear from the rest of the folks okay hey are there any other questions for our bill sponsor seeing none you have three witnesses signed up to testify representative becker is there any order you'd like them to come up in it doesn't matter to me okay and if our witnesses could uh indicate that they are testifying to amendment l004 that would be great um your first witness is brad young if you would state your name and who you represent please for the record thank you madam chairman members of the committee uh representative becker thank you um i'm brad young i'm the [Music] governmental affairs director for rx plus pharmacies the independent pharmacies in the state of colorado most of them are members of rx plus and really this is rx plus is the genesis of of this legislation one of our board members um had an interest in uh in in possibly opening a telepharmacy and it goes back to 2011 when there was talk of a telepharmacy near one of one of the towns that is in southeastern colorado and representative becker's uh observation about walden is exactly right i mean it's 60 miles to the next nearest pharmacy from there and the population is probably large enough that it that it would support uh almost a pharmacy and the problem is is that to locate a the the a pharmacist there doesn't make sense but there's probably enough people looking for pharmacy services there there really should be a pharmacy so the the issue was brought up at one of the conferences that that some of our board members go to every year about telepharmacy and he suggested maybe we ought to look into it here so i approached uh the executive director of the board of pharmacy last year and asked him if he looked into it much and if he saw much of a possibility of doing something in colorado and he said if if you had language that identified uh what kind of characteristics you think it ought to have and put it under other outlet in state law that that would probably be just exactly what we need in order for the board to be able to authorize the the use of telepharmacies as we looked into it more the states that are implementing telepharmacies and we have some members in other states uh that are members of rx plus and one of them actually had opened the one and only telepharmacy in the state of wyoming and um he opened it out of cheyenne as the where where he's located and he opened the telepharmacy in uh pine bluff like 40 miles away and it it hasn't been what you'd call a financial success but it has provided services for people that normally had to travel 40 miles to get to a pharmacy and from that standpoint for patient access it's a it's a it is a success we we wrote the bill in such a way that it that uh we thought it was a very narrow definition that that made sure that the board had as much control as absolutely possible over what would be an issue that that could be interpreted very broadly and we thought that the original language we knew that probably chain pharmacies would be in opposition we thought we'd gauge wonder how much and they were really didn't like it and we also have that practitioner could not own a pharmacy um that that is something that that you will find actually in state law in california and uh in the state of california it's that way there are several states that have prohibitions and we thought we'd put that in as well and cms objected to that representative becker played a very strong role in bringing us all together and saying let's pass something that doesn't bring up some sort of uh professional uh battles and and get something that actually gets done what is good for the people the state of colorado and as a result i think the the compromise language that uh is in the amendment is acceptable uh as far as i know to all parties and it's certainly acceptable to us as as the independent pharmacies we believe that the state board of pharmacy has the authority right now to implement what they believe would be the most effective uh controls over pharmacy and we know that there are remote areas that should pharmacists choose to [Music] make telepharmacy available in those areas that it would be possible the technology is there we've been approached by several different entities that that have the information available and i have been contacted by a representative of the chain pharmacy association who said that given the amendment they would be in support of the bill as well and thank you madam chairman i'd be glad to answer any questions thank you ribs and land graft thank you madam chair and thank you for bringing this bill and thank you for being here i think it's a good idea but i'm still trying to figure out kind of what it looks like because you said walden was that okay so you said walden was almost large enough for a pharmacy yeah but you'd kind of be putting a pharmacy there if you do this so what and then we looked it up and it said they can be in jails or schools or so is this a standalone how do you envision this looking it's working mr young thank you madam chairman um the the board member who approached me uh who who said this is something i'd kind of like to do would see going into uh small town it's not in walden it's in southeast colorado but he said um if if i could go rent a small space where um an office downtown where i could just have an advertised spot i could keep this per by i could keep the prescription drugs there and um i could have a technician hired in town who would go open up and run it as as a as as a business and and basically i guess the way i'm looking at it from what he's told me is he would just have a small office it wouldn't have much of a storefront to it but it'd be a small office where he could store prescription drugs and he would have the telecommunications equipment set up so that the patient would be able to directly across telecommunications equipment see and talk to the pharmacist for any kind of instructions ask questions and the pharmacists and and val calmans and and uh chris gasson is here the executive director of the of the board of pharmacy and he can just and they can go through all the questions i'm not a pharmacist but they could describe what all details have to go on in terms of the telecommunications equipment but there may be a lot of different kinds of equipment that are available and um it the the pharmacist can verify and check at the facility what the uh pharmacist tech so it'd be a technician at the facility and it would be probably just a small storefront it may be possible to open it in a small grocery but that's kind of how i'm envisioning it the other things that are mentioned in there if you if you look they're all kind of public entities the jails schools that was all and i'll i'll let uh chris go through the explanation of that uh better than get into it i don't know the details representative becker did you add something i did the one of the most expensive pieces of keeping a pharmacy open is the cost of the pharmacist because they have um greater education and you know expectations for salary so it's hard for small communities to support a full-time pharmacist if you can have this the a smaller storefront with a farm pharmacy tech who's let's say paid half of what the pharmacist is then you can talk about actually supporting a viable store in a small town and so that's the idea here is the pharmacist is available by video to consult and to watch the prescription being filled and to be available to the um customer but without having to be present and it also is a smaller volume of of potential prescriptions per year so it it means it's a smaller size but otherwise it may not be all that different it's in this section of um outlets because there are these other you know hybrid type pharmacies that aren't full-blown pharmacies but might be in a jail might be in a community health center that sort of thing so uh it's it may i i guess it there aren't that many restrictions on what it really looks like but to kind of give you a picture imagine a smaller pharmacy with a farm tech there that's consulting with a pharmacist by video groups thank you madam chair uh two quick questions who actually buys the buys the drugs and will there be narcotics mr young thank you madam chairman the the the pharmacy that that is the work where the pharmacist is located uh like in the situation i'm thinking about there's a pharmacist in the town of eids he wants to open something in the town of hawley the pharmacist would own the prescriptions and as far as the range of types of drugs that are available i would like to let chris gass and the executive director of the board of pharmacy answer that thank you representative thank you and thank you madam chair and thank you um mr young and thank you representative becker for bringing this forward i just have a couple questions about walden okay that um is there a doctor in walden representative becker there is a there's not a doctor that lives there there's someone that comes in uh i don't know what the schedule is maybe weekly maybe once a week maybe twice a week um to a community health clinic uh that comes periodically but there's no pharmacy there representative janelle so if this were to come in then the patients could get scripts from that physician and go directly to that pharmacy without any of this video representative that's exactly right so because they can get care locally but they can't get pharmacies locally that's a big they can't get prescriptions filled locally that's a problem so they would have to travel to steamboat springs or somewhere to get their prescriptions filled uh you know it we'll see if if they decide that this is a financially viable model for their town uh but it does provide that option thank you madam chair so this video link would be to one certain type of pharmacy like it wouldn't be what if you couldn't get that script filled in your pharmacy then how would that patient get that prescription filled representative becker mr young well the pharmacy you know just to use a brand name we all know if it was walgreens wanted to open up a telepharmacy it would it would be a walgreens pharmacy so it's going to have a direct link to one particular pharmacy it's it's just like opening up a an outlet you know a smaller store it might be that they work at arrangements where you know if the patient can't get down to the bigger city steamboat springs winter park in my district um you know maybe there's an arrangement where the drugs are brought up to that to that telepharmacy but it's associated with one particular store you know whatever that pharmacy is that's now opening up a telepharmacy um those are the ones that communicate to each other thank you madam chair and i'm going to put the question and questions out and if it's if you're not the right folks we've got other people coming then the questions are out there and they can be answered later so the first question is in a situation where you have an outlet like this is the pharmacist still responsible for ensuring the safety of the storage and the prescription the filling of the prescriptions yes representative young thank you madam chair and so then who comes and checks us to make sure they're doing their job mr young board of pharmacies has authority and discretion over um making sure that the rules of the board of pharmacy are enforced thank you manager so is that ultimately cdphe or which state department mr young they're with department of regulatory agencies under professional under professions thank you representative gennall thank you um and so your fiscal note has really no says minimal workload increase but i would think that if this does pass that that would increase your workload so wouldn't that contribute to a fiscal note you may want to save that to for the dora people who put the fiscal note together i would think something can hold that thought okay any other questions for representative wilson thank you madam chair so i'm still stuck on this business model so walgreen and silverthorne could open a telepharmacy and walk and have a technician there on site with a technician who happens to reside in walden be able to contract with a or several pharmacies to open their telepharmacy in walnut mr young do you know the answer to that question um i i think so i think i understand the question um actually the the drugs have to be purchased known by the by a pharmacy and um so it's not like and and the way the legislation is written it says that it can't be located within 20 miles of another pharmacy so you got to be at least 20 miles away from the next nearest pharmacy and um if i understand your question correctly and and you know i went through the same kind of oh what have we put together here what what kind of possibilities are there and i think um actually i think chris gasson from the board of pharmacy has some pretty has has pretty direct answers to to specifically that but i think the way it's constructed right now the way the way i see it moving forward is if say a pharmacy in in steamboat springs or in kremling decides that it is uh it might be viable to open a telepharmacy in walden chances are they're going to pick somebody that they know in walden who would be or train somebody who wants to live there uh to be a pharmacy technician and a pharmacy technician then would be somebody that they'd have to trust a lot and then they'd uh either buy or rent a building or for a store or an office space they would stock the prescription drugs there that they expect are going to be needed in that facility and then that technician would work there and directly interact i don't think that there's going to be a case where a it's not the case that a telepharmacy would be able to contract with multiple pharmacies in order to provide that service if that's kind of where you were headed that the pharmacy technician somehow could work for multiple pharmacies out of that one location representative wilson thank you madam chair um i guess putting it in simple terms are we simply making it possible for the large change to put out their tentacles into the small communities or are we allowing people in the small community to use their entrepreneurship and contract with someone to provide that within their own neighborhood that's my question representative becker mr gassin can answer that more in more detail but we don't expect any chains to actually pursue this opportunity because the outlets are limited in the number of prescriptions they can fill and because those chains have a business uh model that is different than is suitable for a telepharmacy outlet you know the the large chains do a lot of volume just in sales of toothpaste and you know they have a certain square footage typically so i don't think this is ever going to fit their business model but right now it doesn't expl explicitly preclude a chain from opening up a telepharmacy that was just a although they didn't see any a very big likelihood that they would pursue this they also didn't want it written in statute that would prevent them from doing that representative thank you um what about mail order i mean most people have that option to use a mail order pharmacy representative becker mail order is more appropriate for routine care something that can be sent to you automatically on a recurring basis um this perhaps could be used in lieu of that but it would uh but but mail order doesn't fit every need and so if you go to the clinic and you need a prescription filled you know if my son who has a fondness for ear infections um gets an ear infection you know mail order is going to be three days four days whatever it might be driving to steamboat it wouldn't be that easy for me either so um it's that type of situation that i think is going to be most uh that this is going to benefit most all right are there any other questions for mr young sing none thank you for your testimony thank you madam chairman members of the committee representative becker thank you our next witness is val calmans you could uh state your name and who you represent for the record please and if you're testifying to l-004 madam chairman members of the committee i'm val callens the executive director of the colorado pharmacy society we represent pharmacists in all practice settings including independent pharmacy chain pharmacy hospital managed care and long-term care i'm here to testify in support of 1290 and l004 when i was asked to testify i wanted to find out what the needs of the committee were we heard that there was going to be a lot of questions as to what does this look like how is this going to work and i already heard that obviously through some of the discussion we've had so i wanted to just kind of go through the scenario of what it would look like once a telepharmacy would be set up so we would have the let's use eids and holly as the example since that was mentioned by brad young so we have the pharmacist in eads will go ahead and rent a space in holly and they will go ahead and purchase the drugs that'll be what they think is necessary for that community once they have that done they will also set up all of the electronic equipment that's necessary so there would be a video link an audio link i don't know if they're going to be using ipads or they're going to be using computers what have you that can be determined at a later time but bottom line we will have this communication between that particular facility and eads in that facility in holly the pharmacy technician will most likely be an individual that resides in holly that just makes sense it's easier for logistical standpoint because the inventory is going to be owned by that pharmacy that pharmacy technician will probably be an employee of that pharmacy so that's going to go ahead and eliminate the likelihood that that pharmacy technician would be able to do it for a bunch of other telepharmacies as well so once you have that connection set up this is probably what would happen we have the remote site and we have the actual pharmacy connect electronically there's a pharmacy technician at the remote site the patient walks into that remote site in holly presents a prescription the pharmacy technician would scan that prescription and then that actually would appear on the computer at the holley excuse me at the eads pharmacy the pharmacist would look at that image that has been scanned make the initial interpretation and the final evaluation review the patient's profile and check for drug interactions and any other considerations now if this is the first time that that patient is actually appearing for that pharmacy and that pharmacist then obviously a whole patient history record would be taken by the pharmacy technician that information would be transmitted to the pharmacist back in eads and then that would actually be part of that patient's profile then the pharmacy technician would go ahead and prepare the label and actually go ahead and fill that prescription go to the bottle fill the vial and then go ahead and label that particular prescription what the pharmacist will do is they will actually go ahead and look via video link as to whether the stock bottle is correct if the drug dispensed is correct if the strength is correct and then also make sure that the entire label is indeed correct the pharmacy technician would then again go ahead and label that particular product provide it to the patient and then the pharmacist would have a chance to counsel that patient via video link to go ahead and explain to them that this is the medication that you're taking this is how you need to take it this is what you need to avoid these are the different questions that may be coming up as far as that patient is concerned so that link is indeed there so that in essence the patient will be getting the full services of the pharmacist as well so that's pretty much how that would actually look and i hope that that kind of helped a little bit more as far as just kind of seeing the real life image of how that would appear when we're talking about something as abstract as telepharmacy in terms of education and scope of practice can you talk about the difference between the education of a pharmacy tech and a pharmacist and what the scope of practice is for a tech versus a pharmacist madam chairman uh gladly the the pharmacy the pharmacist goes to school for a period of six years two years undergraduate and then usually four years at the pharmacy school they receive a doctor of pharmacy degree many of them choose to go on to perform a residency for either one or two years so as you can see it's a fairly extensive educational background the pharmacy technician many pharmacy technicians actually will go to a community college and be able to go ahead and complete that course in a period of about six months to about a year and a half depending on how sophisticated they want to go ahead and make their education as to whether they want to be working in a hospital and working with ivs and that sort of thing or if they're going to be working in a community retail setting so the obviously education is a big difference in this particular bill there's actually specific comment made as to what the pharmacy technician can do and what the what the pharmacist can do and so when we actually have a definition in the law under the definition of the practice of pharmacy there's a and b a is the interpretation evaluation implementation dispensing of orders participated in drug device selection drug administration reviews drug-related research patient counseling and all those acts services necessary to provide pharmaceutical care that's something a pharmacist can do and only a pharmacist can do b is the preparation mixing assembling packaging labeling and delivery of a drug and device that is what a pharmacy technician is allowed to do so that's where the differentiation occurs between the educational background and the services that can be provided are there any of these locations do you anticipate will be so rural that they wouldn't be able to hook up to the pdmp or anything like that since the electronic communication needs to be fairly sophisticated i do not see that happening hey are there any i'm representing janal um i was just looking up eids colorado and it says that they have five pharmacies there so who would be the lucky one to hook up with your tele telepharmacy whichever representative becker whichever one chooses to pursue this business opportunity and has that been expressed by any one of these pharmacies there has been indeed one pharmacist who has expressed an interest in doing so and fully realizing that this is probably not going to be a real money making proposition simply because the volume required just to go ahead and break even a pharmacy is a fairly large number of prescriptions i don't know if there's actually been a number established as to what the number required to break even is if you have a pharmacy technician doing the dispensing versus a pharmacist doing the dispensing but for a pharmacist who's doing the dispensing the number is anywhere from 160 to 180 prescriptions a day in order to break even thanks are there any other questions for mr calmans seeing them thank you for your testimony today our final two witnesses ronnie hines and chris gaston from dora if you could join us at the table and state your name and who you represent for the record please madam chair members of the committee i'm ronnie hines i'm the the deputy director of the healthcare branch and the division of professions and occupations in dora and i have with me chris gaston program director for the pharmacy board i'll provide a brief testimony and i think we'll which will answer some of the other questions that we heard and then i have the expert here to finish answering your other questions house bill 1290 adds telepharmacy outlet to the pharmacy practice act as an allowed other outlet for limited pharmaceutical purposes the practice of telepharmacy means the dispensing of prescriptions by way of video conferencing to unlicensed assistants and patients in locations where patients may not have direct contact with a pharmacist for over 20 years the pharmacy board has successfully and safely regulated other outlet settings through very specific rules including the use of pharmacy board approved other outlet protocols detailing exactly how other outlets will dispense prescriptions to consumers in the app in the physical absence of a pharmacist in fact some existing other outlet settings already practice telepharmacy the colorado state board of pharmacy regulates and conducts routine inspections of among other registrant types other outlets the term other outlets used to describe a location within colorado that provides limited pharmacy welfare services to patients typically in rural areas of the state where normal normal pharmacy services are simply not available because other outlets offer a low to very low volume of prescription dispensing these settings typically operate without the physical presence of a pharmacist and in doing so are visited by a colorado licensed pharmacist at a frequency predicated by prescription volume as outlined in pharmacy board rules adding telepharmacy as an allowable other outlet for pharmaceutical services would help colorado regulations keep pace with modernizations in the delivery of healthcare and therefore dora supports house bill 1290 and l zero zero four i'm happy to answer any questions or defer to chris i can't have any questions for ms hines representative wilson thank you madam chair and thank you folks for being here so approximately how many sites do you think will qualify under this bill in the state of colorado mr gasson no thank you i really don't know for sure i anticipate we're looking at single digits of folks that would actually apply it's not a money maker and it's very expensive to operate even at telepharmacy part of the expense that goes in is prescription drug stocks and when you ask a pharmacy what is the most expensive part of operating a pharmacy it's their drug inventory the other thing you have to consider is the purchase of video conferencing equipment um and so we're looking at a very low volume prescriptions to justify a business like this when you consider the cost of drug inventory and video conferencing and then you're still having to pay for the services of a pharmacist to conduct the initial interpretation of a prescription order and ultimately the final evaluation of a prescription once it's dispensed are there any other questions for our two dora staff members representative shaffer thank you chair dr gessen thank you for being here miss hines also i'm just wondering how would this small pharmacy such as holly um know which drugs um they should stalk how do they determine that in a regular pharmacy i'm sorry madam chair in a regular pharmacy or a telephone nutella top pharmacy um that's a good question i think a lot of it has to do with just the most common drugs that are most commonly prescribed but it's also determined by the prescribing practices of the practitioners in that area okay thank you all right are there any other questions for our two witnesses sing none thank you for being here today well that concludes the list of people who have signed up to testify is there anyone else in the room who would like to testify on house bill 1290 who's not signed up seeing none the witness phase is closed the bill is ready for action uh representative schaefer would you like to remove the amendment yes madam chair thank you i move l004 second second l zero zero four has been moved by representative shaffer and seconded by representative everett and i think we've heard a good explanation of l zero zero four is there any objection to l zero zero four seeing none l-004 is adopted are there any other amendments no there are none would you like a wrap-up representative becker yes please i i ask for your support for house bill 1290 because this bill um expands patient access to pharmacy care especially in rural communities and greater access to pharmacy care includes increased safety it means increased prescription consultation which can uh reduce the occurrence of medication errors drug overdose and adverse reactions i think this is a bill to help rural colorado and it's an example of medicine adopting to advances in communication and so i ask for an i vote there any other comments from committee before we take the vote representative wilson thank you madam chair i'm still struggling with the piece of if it's going to eliminate let's just put it in terms if i go pick up my tech license and i want to open a telepharmacy does this bill exclude me from going out and recruiting or making a contractual arrangement with a pharmacy to open that telepharmacy or does it depend on the pharmacy and aids to open one in holly which all the revenue from that will go back to eads instead of staying in holly representative becker thank you madam chair i think mr gaston is probably the best person to answer that question do you mind okay mr gaston madam chair thank you can you repeat the question yes where i'm going with this i mean i'm i'm all in favor of this i mean i'm a real person we need this but my point is are we going from outside that community of walden and coming in and taking the revenue back out of walden for this telepharmacy or do i have the ability as a licensed pharmacy technician living in walden america of going out and putting this together myself and coming to you in silverthorne as a licensed pharmacist saying do i have a deal for you mr gaston and currently the only rules that are in place regarding ownership of the of any kind of an outlet registered by the pharmacy board is the 10 percent limitation on physicians so an unlicensed person we can in fact uh open a telepharmacy okay it doesn't have to be a licensed pharmacist so it can be an unlicensed person a layperson can open up their own telepharmacy and they can contract with a licensed pharmacist to perform the pharmaceutical services now whether or not that money stays in town or in another town that i don't know okay thank you mr gaston all right any other comments miss berger will you please call oh the motion sorry i'm getting ahead of myself representative young thank you i move house bill 1290 to the committee of the whole as amended with a favorable recommendation second okay house bill 1290 has been moved to the committee hole with the favorable recommendation by representative young seconded by representative schaefer and it is as amended miss berger will you okay mr burger would you please call representatives conte yes everett yes you know yes joshi yes landra yes mccann excused schaefer yes singer yes stevens yes tyler yes wilson yes young yes madam chair yes congratulations representative becker your bill passes 12-0 see you in the committee of the whole thank you very much everyone for your support all right our final bill on the agenda is senate bill 18 by representative hamner and representative young so there was an open date for me to vote okay i should have told you that i was just this bill shouldn't have any problems looks like you have samples here yeah i think are you gonna pass out cigarettes for us nicotine products okay representative hamner and young are you organized yet well thank you madam chair and committee thank you for hearing senate bill 18. i think we would all agree that we should follow current law about the distribution of tobacco products to minors and that that's not allowable in the state of colorado the complicating fact is that there are new and interesting and appealing products and we're going to pass some of these around because if you're like me you had no idea that some of these products were out there um they're being packaged and marketed in ways that are appealing to people children 18 and younger i think we all recognize that that's a very vulnerable age i have true confession i started smoking cigarettes at 17 which i never had so this is a really important issue to me personally but also as someone who cares deeply as as you do about young people and helping them make good decisions current it currently it's confusing to the retailers about some of these products that maybe are tobacco and maybe not tobacco but are nicotine and whether they're allowable to be sold to children under 18 or not so senability teen clarifies that for retailers and protects our youth and i'll let representative young make some comments while i have you pass this around oh and there's more representative young thank you madam chair and you have a couple of educators here so we can't uh uh avoid having show and tell so that's why we have uh items to take a look at and you know as representative hamner indicated you know i haven't been into the retail convenience stores to really seek out these products i don't use them so i was a little amazed when i began to look at what senator nicholson had put together and realize that the marketing has changed on tobacco and nicotine products and they don't look like what we used to see and they're not just cigarettes and was a little astounded earlier in the year when someone told me that cigars were favored by junior high students and middle school students and i just couldn't feature that until i actually saw how they were being marketed now and realized that we've had a sea change in the way tobacco and nicotine products are being marketed so and as representative hamner has indicated that i think there's while the law may be clear to lawyers it may not be clear to everyone else and you know sometimes that happens with our statutes i've seen that with dui legislation where actually lawyers weren't able to actually follow the law until we recodified it didn't actually make any substantial change to the law but made it so everyone could really understand what was permissible and what was not and so and by the way as those items are going around we need those back we're keeping an eye on you so but please do take a look at them and uh um so the intent of this um of this legislation is to make our statutes clear at a practical level at the street level so that everybody understands exactly what is permissible what isn't we want to make sure that that our children under 18 are not having access to tobacco and nicotine products or any devices that would deliver those products to them and so with that we'll entertain questions we have witnesses and that are coming to testify may be able to answer more technical questions for you but we'll try to answer them as best we can now are there any questions for our bill sponsor representative stevens thank you madam chair let me ask does this also include though for people who uh i say students but um youth under the age of 18 who are trying to quit so for example are they then barred from using nicotine gum are they barred from using anything under the direction of a doctor if they so chose to quit because we do to but we do tobacco and nicotine cessation programs in high schools and we we do target this age group because we if they have started we want to get them off uh and in some times there is a case for intervention so um would this how would this play into that representative hamner thank you madam chair and thank you representative stevens for it's a great question the bill does not uh does it does not include any changes uh to the prohibition there's no prohibition on regarding the sale of smoking cessation products that are approved by the fda okay so representative stevens oh good uh the other question then would be and there have been um i don't know the whole issue of uh european or chewing tobacco in terms of nicotine delivery but but wherewith and so i'm going to assume already these products are already out we have already outlawed all of those so we're just saying any other product under a different name that includes nicotine is this correct representative young yes that's correct and also in answer to your first question on page four of the re-engrossed version of the bill uh lines three through seven specifically respond and that was already in the in the statutes before but we're just expanding it so it's tobacco or nicotine for clarity represent a bland graph thank you madam chair does this include things like um you know the papers that people use to wrap make cigarettes so would be used with tobacco or nicotine products representative young representative lambgraf that's a great question that i do not have the answer to but hopefully one of our our witnesses will be able to answer that thank you representative hamner thank you madam chair um and thank you representative lanegraft for the question the bill language doesn't speak to the papers but it does include any electronic device that can be used to deliver nicotine including but not limited to electronic cigarettes cigars cigarrellos or pipes it doesn't speak specifically to rolling papers so that's a great question perhaps our bill director can answer that if you can't representative young and uh and actually thank you madam chair we've eliminated the word electronic from this so it's any device that can be used to deliver nicotine and so perhaps it does i think maybe our witnesses may be able to get confirmation on that but we removed electronic because not all devices that deliver tobacco or nicotine actually do so electronically so um that's true right i was just going to say it it may include the papers but you may want to clarify that's a good idea okay are there any other questions for our bill sponsors seeing none you have one two three four five witnesses signed up let's see for our for your bill and one is against do you have any preference for who you'd like to bring up young thank you man i'm sure we'll take the witnesses and support first please okay our first witness is april montgomery join us at the table and state your name and who you represent please for the record welcome and thanks for being here [Applause] i'm april montgomery and i'm here as a volunteer for the march of dimes in support of senate bill 18. um we've the march of dimes currently major thrust is the prevention of prematurity and tobacco and nicotine products are one of the causes of prematurity the as a matter of fact a few years ago the colorado department of public health in collaboration with the march of dimes did a study on attributable risk risk for prematurity and one of the major factors was tobacco use now i'm happy to report that the that has become less of a risk and there's fewer premature births due to tobacco at this point but there's still a fair number of them so what this bill would do would be again to add nicotine to those to the prohibition with tobacco products for children for individuals under age 18 what this will do will be to protect young women and their children who from exposure to nicotine there's also some evidence that not just tobacco products but that in animal studies that nicotine is detrimental to the development of the nervous system in those are animal studies not humans so it is important indeed to protect young women of childbearing age and their children from nicotine and tobacco project products thank you are there any questions for miss montgomery representative conte thank you madam chair i'm just wondering the little products that are going around in the baggies over here the tablets that people are dissolving in their mouth that contain nicotine and tobacco products have studies been done on that are the health risks any greater or different i'm not aware of the of any studies there may have been but i'm not aware of them representative thank you madam chair we just passed a bill for a prohibition of selling uh tobacco cigarettes to people under the age of 21 is that correct representative hamner may not know that representative young thank you ma'am john i don't think that's come to the floor yet i understand that it may be in process i think we did it representational i'm sorry madam chair my question is to you why is it 18 years of age and not 21. that statute thank you madam chair representative genele i don't believe that that bill has gone through the the statutes yet but it is uh both this bill and that bill are addressing the same part of the statute so if both bills are passed then there will have to be some harmonizing that will be done okay thank you hey are there any other questions for miss montgomery seeing none thank you for your testimony today thank you madam chair and thank you for the committee our next witness is gabe kaplan you could join us at the table please state your name and who you represent for the record [Music] good afternoon madam chairman and members of the committee uh it's a privilege to be here today i'm here on behalf my name is gabriel kaplan i'm the director of healthy living and chronic disease prevention at the state health department and i'm here on behalf of dr larry walk the executive director of the department and the state's chief medical officer and i'm pleased today to convey the department's support for this piece of legislation tobacco use remains the leading cause of death and disease in colorado and kills more than 4 300 of our citizens annually each year and costs our state 2 billion dollars in health care and our employers 1 billion and lost productivity each year we're beginning to understand now that smoking is actually uh also understood in the pediatric world as a pediatric disease over 80 percent of tobacco users first try uh tobacco before the age of 18 and many of them become addicted at this point in their lives and then have to have the rest of their life to struggle with this addiction and the consequences of it preventing youth initiation is the key to reducing the burden of tobacco in our state like the rest of the nation we've made great strides in reducing the use of tobacco and protecting our citizens from the toxic effects of secondhand smoke since the broncos last won the super bowl in 1998 we've facilitated conditions we've facilitated conditions that have reduced the number of smokers in our state by 200 000 this means that we will have fewer lung cancers down the road fewer deaths from such cancers and fewer incidences of cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease nicotine is a highly addictive component of tobacco products and such products that are available to youth now come in a myriad of forms including e-cigarettes chewable tablets flavored strips and there's even talk about other products such as nebulizers which could deliver this through non-electronic forms studies from the stanford school of medicine and others demonstrate that the industry has used candy-like flavors and tobacco products to appeal to youth and to create lifelong habits and dependence while youth smoking rates have dropped steadily along with adult rates in more recent years we've seen that this decrease has leveled out suggesting that we may be losing ground in our efforts to prevent tobacco initiation among youth the public health community believes that fewer that newer flavored products such as e-cigarettes are likely to contribute to youth addiction and nearly 37 percent of high school students in our last survey reported that they had already tried smoking and nicotine infused products research suggests that many youth who experiment with tobacco start with easier to use products such as flavored products these new nicotine products now emerging on the market are just one more potential gateway into a lifelong addiction to tobacco this bill reiterates the state's commitment to being the healthiest state and unequivocally emphasizes our intolerance of efforts by marketers and tobacco companies to lure our youth to a lifetime addiction of nicotine and tobacco we hope you can support this important legislation and we remind you that this bill really does three things first it reiterates the state's commitment to health by reiterating our commitment that youth not initiate smoking and use of nicotine infused products second it clarifies requirements associated with signage in the retail establishments and you'll be hearing uh testimony from a representative of the retail establishment in the retail industry talking about how they appreciate the clarification that this legislation will provide and finally it also makes clear that there are a number of products that are now emerging on the market that provide mechanisms to deliver nicotine not necessarily tobacco but they set up potential health problems for us down the road so we hope you can join us in supporting this important piece of legislation thank you for your attention and time thank you are there any questions for mr kaplan representative wilson thank you madam sharon thank you for being here you were talking about the rate of smoking dropping what what do you attribute that drop i thought it was the broncos but mr kaplan thank you madam chair and thank you representative wilson pretty sure the broncos although it's traumatic at times has had nothing to do with our smoking incidents in the state um however uh i think we had some early successes due to a number of factors i think conditions and policy and changes that were facilitated by the general assembly and the administrations of recent years created conditions which made it more challenging for individuals to smoke and encourage people who did smoke to sit uh to sustain from smoking and also gave other others pause from initiating tobacco i think legislation that the legislature has passed such as efforts to limit access to electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products also have assisted this and the policy changes such as increases in price through efforts like amendment 35 have made it more challenging for the youth to have access to the kinds of resources that would support the sustained commitment to smoking and so those factors together were resulted in associated with a drop in smoking among youth from the mid to late 1990s through to about the middle of the last decade and then we saw those numbers stall around the late parts of what i guess people now term the auths the first decade of the 2000s representative wilson thank you manager in any explanation i noticed the word enforcement was missing so if we pass this and say nothing mustn't do we depend on people complying with it what's the enforcement piece since right now it's illegal for 18 year olds and under to be smoking or using any kind of tobacco product where's the enforcement piece mr kaplan thank you madam chair and thank you representative wilson do the sponsors of legislation want to speak to enforcement as it is uh sort of provided and covered in the bill or i'm just inviting you i don't have representative young thank you madam chair i don't have statistics on that but i do know that there is current enforcement that there are some tickets that are written in fines assessed both for real retailers that that sell is someone underage and also to underage consumers who buy them so that's already a process that's in place in the statutes and and is enforcement albeit maybe not as vigorous as we all might want but it is it is enforced i'm not sure that's an answer to your question representative wilson on the fiscal note talk there's a thing about background and the department of revenue has a role in enforcement mrexcel wilson thank you madam chair and thank you again and my point being i'd only been in school for 40 years but i can count on one hand the number of citations issued to those who are supplying minors with cigarettes i see the same thing here we can say that we're going to keep nicotine away is there an improvement in the enforcement piece of this because if i'm standing on the street corner smoking a cigarette and i'm 14 years old i think i'm breaking the law or at least i could put the heat on who may have contributed to delinquency of a minor here what's the enforcement piece on this it's going to actually make a difference rather than make us feel good i don't know if you can answer that mr kaplan thank you madam chair and thank you uh representative wilson so there are provisions in the legislation uh regarding um the the penalties uh for providing and distributing and dispensing these products the department of revenue is the primary lead agency charged in the state to handle enforcement around the retail side the department of public health and environment also has a piece of support that comes from the food and drug administration which tasks us with also inspecting retail establishments to ensure that they comply with advertising and retail requirements associated with the sale of these products the fda and the department of revenue do issue citations to retailers who are not seen as being in compliance with this legislation i think that the rates of enforcement indicate that our retail partners are actually pretty good compliers with this requirement there is some research that suggests that obviously there are mechanisms but through which youth can access these goods through various mechanisms and strategies and they are successful from time to time um the actual enforcement of a youth smoking a product such as that is is the realm of law enforcement and not the realm of public health representative young thank you madam chair and at the bottom of the second page of the fiscal note i think you'll see that there have been the past two years have been approximately 300 violations of the existing statute that have been cited and i agree that that our retailers are are doing well with this but they probably could do better and i think you'll hear one of our other witnesses talk about the fact that the changes that we're making to the um to the statute here actually provide them the kind of clarity to even do better in that regard janelle thank you madam chair um two questions um when did this these types of tobacco products actually hit the market so to say so to say what year would you say they came on board and how fast is this growing from 2010 to 2012 to 2014 are we seeing this go up in single digits are we seeing this going up exponentially mr kaplan uh thank you man of chair and thank you representative janelle that's a great question uh we first observed the emergence of electronic cigarettes about three or four years ago in the state of colorado the state of colorado was actually targeted by a large tobacco company as a test market to test this product we've seen that early in the years of this product it was small small industrial manufacturers who entered this business line first and advanced and promoted these products but the larger tobacco retail companies have identified that this could be a potentially lucrative market and they've bought out many of those retailers and so now when you walk into a convenience store retail establishment if you see some of the more popular brands many of them are owned by the larger tobacco companies representative janelle thank you madam chair e-cigarettes i can understand but what about those chewables and those sticks and all those other things when did they come come into play mr kaplan do you know that uh i don't actually know the date that those products were uh introduced i know we began testifying uh on those products about uh four or five years ago i remember my colleagues who were coming to the capitol at the time to testify on behalf of those products and i know that the department was involved in testifying and legislation associated with the emergence of those products around dissolvables in particular uh about four years ago representative janelle last question and you've seen a steady increase in those sales or uh single digits double digits i'm just trying to see how fast growing thank you madam chair so uh we don't have the sale data uh that would be probably in the realm of the department of revenue uh that had would have greater access to that information through sales data there are uh data sources by which we could uh access those but they're through marketing companies like nielsen they're pretty expensive and we haven't looked at them yet uh we do have a survey in the field uh that actually is just being concluded and we'll be able to look at uh the youth utilization of these products uh we did not ask the serv these questions in 2008 because they weren't on our radar in 2010 we didn't have because of the downturn the resources to run that survey so we ran the survey uh in 2012 and 13 in high schools and middle schools and we added those questions and we should be having those results in april about and we'll be able to answer those questions and be happy to provide the legislature with the report on that thank you thanks okay are there any other questions for mr kaplan grifton conte thank you madam it's uh representative stevens did you want to say something risen two and a half percent just from 210 to 212. so about eight point about eight and a half percent of seniors were using the chewable uh the tablets we just saw and most young women now want to use it for weight loss i mean obviously that would be you can understand that so that's catching one representative young man i'm sure seniors meaning me or seniors many seniors in high school oh okay just checking so from 2 10 to 2 12. so you have about six five up to about an eight about eight or something it's it is among under 18. you'll see that it is growing representative conti i'm sorry that's okay thank you so much i guess i'm just wondering most of the products that i saw that were passed around commented that they were a combination of tobacco and nicotine why then would they not be covered under current statute representative conte i mean representative young sorry representative conte thank you and under the existing statute if they contained tobacco then in fact they would have been but we are not only considering products now that might contain nicotine only but also those in the future that would also not be a tobacco product but contain nicotine and that was not would not have been covered representative conte thank you madam chair so are any of the products that you passed around in the handy-dandy little sort of sealed pouch uh qualify under this or representative hamner uh thank you madam chair and thank you representative conte because that's why we're having this discussion to clarify um current law includes um that what's prohibited to under 18 is cigarettes and tobacco products so this is clarifying that these new products also pertain to this um to not being able to be sold to under 18 to people under the age of 18. represent county thank you madam chair can you point to particular which products i'm sorry maybe i didn't look thoroughly enough but i didn't see anything that didn't say that it had tobacco in it so to me all of those would be covered under the current statute or maybe i'm missing something is there something in there that wouldn't be covered that doesn't say that doesn't have tobacco in it something that's just nicotine only yeah i didn't see anything most of the dissolvables do say tobacco yeah yeah i think they do and representative young thank you madam chair again let me just say again representative conte that we're also considering uh looking forward so we're not in a re reactive mode that there would be products that would be nicotine only in the future well i i understand i'll look through to see if i can find it okay i just i just am wondering is this legislation in search of a problem or is there really a problem and or is the problem that we're not be able to enforce the laws that are already on the books ten years ago when i worked for department of revenue the liquor and tobacco enforcement agent agency that was part of department of revenue hired teenagers to actually go into stores to try and purchase liquor and tobacco products as a covert kind of an operation so um i know they do work really hard in enforcing these laws i'm sure they do and i'm sure i know that there are certain ways in which their hands are tied and i'm wondering if that's more the issue than what i'm wondering if this is going to fix the problem representative hamner um thank you madam chair and i do believe in and thank you representative conte that because there are so many new kinds of products these aren't the typical pack of cigarettes that everyone knew was you know not to be sold to people under the age of 18. these products are so new and different i think this is just the bill is clarifying that these new products fall under that category as well i think it's something that the retailers find helpful and is clarifying to our young people that these are also products that are equally dangerous as a pack of cigarettes so i think it's just clarifying representative schaefer thank you madam chair i think we've seen the tobacco industry be very creative and entrepreneurial in their marketing and their selling our attempts to sell and we're going to see new products with nicotine in them and i do believe we need to be proactive and get prepared for this when we consider the damages to young people of any kind of tobacco or nicotine use gripz and conte did you have another question well i guess i'm just wondering why did you find something i haven't yet but okay i'm trying to listen to it i'm just wondering couldn't couldn't this be handled through simply rule clarification through the department of revenue for the current cigarette marketers or something like that that might be a question for the bill drafter unless you guys can answer that but we already have legislation that outlaws everything that they're showing us okay mr kaplan thank you madam chair uh i think it's an excellent question and i i see your point representative conte i think the intent behind this legislation and one of the reasons that the public health community is attracted to it is what has been alluded to in the comments which is that this market is really rapidly changing we've seen it change so much in the last four or five years and we can already anticipate products uh that may be derived from tobacco or that really don't have to be derived from tobacco but that deliver nicotine either through an electronic cigarette or through a nebulizer or other kinds of delivery vehicles that may not have to have a tobacco label on them and therefore may cause confusion in a retail environment as to well is this something i can sell to an 18 year old or is this something that i can't sell to an 18 year old and so i think it's really by clarifying and really limiting the complete the confusion for the retailer uh it just makes for a much better environment for the retail establishment to be in business and and to know that they're in compliance with the law thank you madam chair just i just wanted to clarify just because there may be some loopholes here um with nicotine we have nicotine cigarettes that are gum that's available by prescription correct and that has x amount of nicotine in it are we going to get ourselves caught up in a situation here where you know you can sell a small amount of nicotine so many milligrams and it's okay but if you surpass that then it's against the law is this all nicotine containing products no matter what amount they have in them mr kaplan are these nicotine patches and things that are prescribed by doctors bought through pharmacies and not the same kind of product as these products that are sold at liquor stores and that kind of thing along with representational question so that's an excellent question i don't actually know if there is an age restriction on obtaining the product uh through a prescription and or whether you can get it over the counter if you are under 18 my understanding is you cannot if you aren't 18 obtain it over the counter and the legislation does have specific language saying that those products that are used for cessation that are approved by the food and drug administration the department of health and human services for cessation purposes are exempt from this legislation representative clarification nicotine patches are exempt from this mr kaplan you'd have to check with the office of legislative legal counsel since i'm not a lawyer but i believe the language does exempt them from this legislation we saw somebody wander in from legislative legal services so we might have to bring her up representative hamner thank you madam chair and we'll have to find the exact i don't have the re-engrossed bill in front of me i'm sorry but there is language that makes it very clear that if a product has already been approved by the fda it doesn't pertain to this legislation page four representative however nicoderm cq is i think i believe it's an over-the-counter product which is a nicotine patch and i don't see anything in just this brief bringing up this screen here that says you have to be a certain age to buy this representative thank you madam chair i think if we can continue with testimony i i hope that we have someone who can specifically answer your question representative general thanks thank you any more questions for mr kaplan representative wilson thank you madam chair i finally found what i was looking for it's been a while since i looked at the 18 code as a superintendent but the definition in current statute of tobacco product any product that contains nicotine or tobacco or is derived from tobacco and is intended to be ingested inhaled or applied to the skin any electronic device can be used to deliver nicotine i mean all these things are covered in present statute are they not i have our bill drafter who's up here well not our builder after but someone from legislative legal services would you like to join us kristen state your name and thank you are you representing thank you madam chair kristen forrestal from legislative legal services um i believe representative wilson is right the definition does the current definition of tobacco product does include nicotine products but um i believe the intent of this from senator nicholson's side was to clarify in statute because throughout statute we just say cigarettes or tobacco products and according to the builder after jennifer berman that that was confusing to people so she wanted to make sure that nicotine product was throughout the statutory sections so people knew it was including all these new products out there thank you and what about i think representative landgraf had a question about whether the papers could still be sold under this bill there was a lot of discussion about those types of products in the senate um it came down to even like soda cans that could be formed into pipes to smoke from which i think is beyond the scope of this bill and you could still sell a soda can to a miner but it's my understanding that if you had something that's specifically made for tobacco like rolling papers then you would not be able to sell them to minors thank you okay are there any other questions for our bill drafter or our legislative legal service expert actually okay thank you okay any other questions for mr kaplan seeing none thank you for your testimony today okay um the next person is greer bailey you could join us at the table state your name and who you represent for the record please just for a few minutes appreciate it come a long way thank you madam chair members of the committee greg bailey i'm the government affairs director for the petroleum marketers association convenience store association why we're here today is that we represent about 1200 of the convenience stores in the state um we're testifying in support of this bill for for a couple different reasons and i'll make sure i try to address your concerns representative conte um essentially retailers have between a 92 and 96 compliance rate uh currently according to the department of revenue and the synar reports every year with uh sales to tobacco and nicotine to minors not that eight percent is good and the retailers can do better and we we feel that this bill will help us especially a lot of our newer store owners which are first generation americans have a greater understanding of the law specifically on page four of the bill or i'm sorry not page four now uh page six of the bill where it says required signage that has to be posted at all retail establishments um this is this is a current law but the current law says it is legal for any person or 18 of age years of age to purchase tobacco products and non-conviction 100 fine may be imposed now it's very clear to me as representative wilson noted that tobacco products if a retailer would call me does include nicotine but for but for our newer store owners and their interactions with customers many of whom are trying in some cases against the law to try and buy tobacco products from us nicotine products while not clearly defined on the sign can be construed differently by the store owner and we don't want to put our store energies in a position where they're having to debate the merits of a nicotine versus a tobacco product anymore and so just as a general practice it's better for the retail community more regulatory surety and it's a better public policy for the state in order for us to continue to maintain that 92 to 96 compliance rate which we get matching federal dollars from for being for being above the sinai report criteria to uh to have that sign change just a little bit and so it includes all these nicotine products i think representative stevens is pretty accurate one she said is that as cigarette consumption declines our stores have seen a slight increase uh 48 over the last couple years in the sale of these otp products and that's another source of confusion for the retail community and that otp products and cigarette products are taxed differently and so again it's just by marrying these in the sales to minor statutes it provides a single a single way for retailers to say you know what i don't care what it is if it is nicotine if it's tobacco or if it's whatever nobody under the age of 18 should be ever having and so that's actually a benefit for the retail community and it's a benefit for the state to maintain that high compliance level for retailers um so part of the other questions so representative wilson was correct theoretically they are and actually in reality they are all currently covered but for me trying to explain that to a person who just got you know written up for a first time violation for selling a dissolvable nicotine strip this this provides more clarity because these signs are actually provided by the department revenue for free to the entire retail community and so these signs will be changed and then it's going to be a requirement as currently requirement for all these signs to be posted at the point of sale at the register and then getting rid of that the excise tax disparity you know that that argument saying well why is cigarettes taxed differently and why am i inspected differently for cigarettes rather than otp for those excise taxes and if they're treated differently why aren't they treated differently under the law and this this helps clear that up for us as well and so really really it's just a regulatory clarity issue looks like you raised some questions representative conte thank you madam chair first of all just so um i'm you know operating in clarity here otp stands for mr bailey other tobacco products thank you um in the world of alphabet soup that we live in it's always nice to have clarity um and so i guess again i seek only to understand why based on current statute could you not go ahead and put these signs in all of your retail stores and know that you are consistent with the law mr bailey we could um we could do it just voluntarily but the signage requirement is delineated in statute and so by adding the nicotine word in the same nicotine products even though under current law it is they're all dealing with the same things tobacco and nicotine products this this is a requirement that can help help hold retailers accountable for something that is important for the state and for the retail community and our joint effort with our colleagues in the health community to keep nicotine and tobacco away from minor so we really don't see this as a regulatory burden just a regulatory update to something we already do county final final let me just recap and see if i understand what's going on basically you have people in your stores that assume or are running on a possible false assumption that because of the signs that have been previously printed that they don't understand that cigarettes and tobacco includes any kind of product with nicotine and it's too big a hassle a corporate expense so whatever to do this out and if it's in statute then the department of revenue will do it for you is that it mr bailey okay representative young thank you madam chair i'd like to step in because actually the statute require currently requires the sign so if if they corporate if they did it as a corporate venture to change the sign they actually would be in violation of a requirement in statute so this provides clarity about what exactly needs to be on the sign so that everybody uses the same sign in the same way representative conte thank you madam chair who currently pays for those signs they can be mr bailey sorry manager um we can either produce them individually or that we can get them from the department of revenue representative wilson okay so no change thank you madam chair and as much as i enjoy passing legislation it seems to me i think representative connie was right the signs have been wrong all along the statutes been very clear whoever passed this statute were they were way ahead of us because they list all these products and nicotine and pipes cigarillos electronic cigarettes so if we pass this legislation the government will pay for the signs to update the signs and make sure that all the store owners are aware of the statute if we don't pass it we need to have a new sign anyway and make sure that all the store owners are aware of what the statute already says so i'm struggling with why we need the legislation and understand the the retail operators are the good guys in this my thing about enforcement is when it leaves that store walks out the door and hits the streets that's the enforcement part but i don't understand what's the difference whether we pass this or not we've got to have new signs because they've been in violation of this all along mr bailey it's um slightly inaccurate to say that this has been the way that it's been forever and ever because e-cigarettes haven't been around forever and ever and it was actually a representative ken summers who updated the statutes only um four or five years ago and added some of these electronic cigarettes to the current age to sales to minor statutes and so at that point it probably would have been better to update the signs at that point but we didn't and really what the retailers are are concerned about is transparency to consumers and that interaction and face-to-face between the clerks and that person who might not want a tobacco product but might want a nicotine dissolvable product and so being able to point to something that say the state makes me post that the state says you're not allowed to have nicotine along with and you're not allowed to have tobacco products and while you know and i know and everybody on the committee knows and the department of revenue knows that tobacco products do contain that definition does contain nicotine products it still doesn't it still helps being as transparent as possible at our point of sales and our retail establishments to your point about the penalties actually that not to bring up but but house bill 1263 the fiscal net on that representative canspiel does a very very good job of outlining the current enforcement penalties for things like sales to minors and the attempts of an underage person to try and buy tobacco products but i can tell you that the retail community shares your frustration with once that interaction leaves the store and you see that 15 year old kid walking down the street with a cigarette or whatever that the lack of enforcement and the lack of citations by law enforcement is is very very frustrating representative wilson thank you manager and i'm not badging you here i'm just i'm just really struggling with how more transparent can we be than the current statute it's extremely clear the problem is that the store owners have not been informed what the statute says all those products in this bill that i read unless i'm missing something are defined right here and if that was representative summers kudos to him because he was ahead of his time he addressed every issue that we're talking about now so what am i missing in this mr bailey i would say energy support in this legislation that adding the word nicotine to the signs is more transparent for the actual consumers and store owners who might not be as sophisticated to know that and then i would also assert that these statutes and these laws and regulations do continually need to be revised and looked at and it doesn't hurt the state at all to treat retailers like customers and periodically take an opportunity to remind us of the current laws and regulations represented wilson and then i'm going to be quiet any product that contains nicotine it can't get any more plain than that in current statute i completely agree with mister thank you i mean i i completely agree with that that's what it says gripson of landgraf thank you madam chair so so what this will really do is is force a new sign that adds the word nicotine mr bailey yes representative landgraf thank you madam chair so the fiscal note uh shows really no no fiscal but the signs are certainly going to cost something i would guess quite a bit based on the number of stores that will have to get new signs if the stores don't pay for them and the state provides them free there has to be someone there has to be a cost somewhere yeah mr bailey i know you don't work for revenue and you didn't put the fiscal note together but if you can answer that you can go on to the department of revenue website right now and download an actual um sign and a pdf format that meets the criteria of the legislation and there is nothing in that in the in the law that requires a certain amount of you know it's plaque carding or some sort of material or whatever so in all reality a single sheet of 11 by you know 8 by 11 paper whatever the criteria is you know taped up at the point of sales sinus sufficient rips and planned graph thank you so the various stores actually print them is what it sounds like you're saying the state doesn't send them to you you go down you download them yourselves mr bailey and main practice for the for the for the stores that choose to for the stores that choose to utilize the department of revenue site there's that we do have some stores that make a big deal out of not wanting to sell tobacco or nicotine to miners and so they they tend to take the current regulation and they um jazz it up to make it very very clear representative blandgraf okay so they can add the word nicotine now if they can jazz it up is that mr bailey there's something being missed here i'm at what am i missing it's so the so the so the regulation says that the sign has to say this it's in in reality it's no different than any other signs that we have to you know post on our gasoline pumps that say may contain 10 ethanol make made you know nfpa fire code whatever you know the wording is specifically picked for a reason and while it's certainly possible that a retailer could just choose to add the word nicotine the state regulation says the signs have to look like this mr bailey i know that i'm not sure where the genesis for this legislation came from i know you've been working on it is it because the retailers needed clarification that this bill was brought forward do you know that thank you madam chair um nobody in the real retail community senator nicholson's been very very great at working with both i think the health community and the retail community um tobacco cessation is something that's very important to her and you know she was kind of asking you know the you know kind of not so much in relation to this bill but what the community could together could continue to in light of these new products keep keep our compliance rates up and keep tobacco nicotine products out of the hands of kids but i can't genuinely say that our association asked her for this legislation now okay thank you representative hamner thank you madam chair and actually i've been involved in versions of this legislation probably for three years when senator nicholson was the senator for summit county she and i were both approached to carry legislation that probably went way further than this where this legislation goes but i just want to remind the committee that this is a real problem that these products are being sold to children under the age of 18 not intentionally i think because our current legislation is unclear and what i'm hearing from mr bailey is that the convenience stores would appreciate this level of clarification from us and that we'll hear from our health community that this is a step in the right direction to protect our young people and i think just looking at these products we had to get our reading glasses on and look at the ingredients to see if they actually had tobacco in them i think it's just an effort to be uh clear and to to you know just for more clarity on the part of the retailers and the youth trying to purchase these products representative conte final question i promise is it possible right now that as a chain of convenience stores petroleum marketers whatever you want to call yourselves that you could send out an email to all of your store owners with the link to the department of revenue site maybe even the specific link hyperlink that would take them to the sign that would add nicotine in the definition and that they could go to that link and print off a sign that would include the word nicotine can they do that right now today and is there a reason that they can't do that mr bailey yes we could send out a link to our 1200 members yes we could link the department of revenue sign but absent this legislation the law specifically requires this sign and this sign says tobacco products not nicotine representative so there is no sign currently thank you madam chair there is no sign currently that adds the word nicotine mr bailey not that's mandated by the state that's what this bill would accomplish for the retail community and not that the state even offers mr bailey i'm not aware of a sign that the state offers that it contains nicotine so that's what we're doing okay okay are there any other questions for mr bailey i feel kind of sorry for you mr bailey i'm just happy to be here supporting in tobaccoville thank you thanks for your testimony today hey our final witness and in favor of the bill donna viverette you join us at the table please and welcome state your name and who you represent for the records madam chair committee members my name is donna vivaret and i'm here representing the colorado association for local public health officials and jefferson county public health good afternoon and thank you for your up for the opportunity to speak on behalf of calfo and jeffco public health in support of senate bill 18 as we've already heard declines in youth smoking have been partially offset by the growing popularity of these kinds of products that you're looking at today they include little cigars flavored cigars dissolvable tobacco electronic cigarettes and hookah that's a word you haven't yet heard i think this this afternoon the 2012 national youth tobacco survey found that e-cigarette use among high schoolers doubled between 2011 and 2012 with use in the last 30 days increasing over 80 percent among middle schoolers and high schoolers hookah use by high school has increased by 30 percent in that same time period in the past year since the study's completion those of us working in the local tobacco control effort would say that the increase of the availability and use of these types of products and devices is alarming among youth i invite you to do an internet search on any of the terms including hookah vapor stones vapor electronic pens hookah sticks these are other nicotine and tobacco containing products and the accessories for their use are often come in colorful packaging are in self-service displays and are not regulated by the fda product flavors include traditional menthol as well as banana split cinnamon roll starbuzz acid all-american whiskey and party hearty peach because these products are not fda regulated nicotine content is often unknown or if it's listed it may be mislabeled an fda study to assess nicotine levels in e-juice the nicotine liquid that is used to smoke out of an electronic device found that some of these devices labeled as nicotine-free actually did include contain nicotine students conducting informal assessments of the availability and promotion of these products in several of our communities in jefferson county reported that it's relatively easy for them to get these products citing that some store clerks as we've heard believe that some of these may be legal to sell to minors senate bill 18 with its more inclusive definition of tobacco and nicotine products will make it clear for clerks that not only are cigarettes smokeless tobacco illegal to sell the miners but so are electronic cigarettes hookah dissolvables and other devices used to inhale nicotine i'm looking to see if i might deviate to some of the things that may be more relevant given this point in the discussion um on page three at the bottom at the bottom of page three in the bill the definition under the definition of tobacco 27 line 27 it says any electronic device that can be used to deliver nicotine to the person inhaling from the device and just note that electronic has been struck so that amendment in effect allows for the coverage of a number of non-electronic devices that were not formally covered under the legislation those non-electronic devices include hookah pipes and as mr kaplan stated nebulizers that are also non-electronic so that's an addition that senate bill 18 affords if it were passed with this amendment included i want to you know just talk a little bit about nicotine it's not a benign substance it's you know especially for adolescents with their developing brain nicotine is known to impact the maturation healthy maturation of the brain and it's highly highly addictive has a very short half-life just two days of use for a vulnerable adolescent can result in nicotine dependence um and and and potentially a lifelong addiction and and the health effects related to tobacco dependence um calfo and fanac and or calfo and jefferson county public health support this bill with the proposed amendments as it would assist local efforts to keep all nicotine products and the devices used to inhale them out of the hands of miners the amendments being proposed strike to strike the term electronic as it relates to devices effectively covers both electronic and non-electronic devices used to inhale nicotine making these illegal to minors thank you so much for your time and consideration of this important public health issue thank you other questions for miss vivaret representative wilson i thought you said you were going to be quiet that was on the last witness and i stayed quiet until the next witness came thank you thank you madam chair and and thank you for your testimony and trust me there's well i won't say there's no one any more rabid about that but i'm in the group against nicotine and kids smoking and so forth trust me on this so if they're if their use is increased then are we implying that the stores are not doing their job on keeping them from purchasing them since it's already illegal under the statute is that what we're saying miss favorite thank you madam chair wow there are a number of ways that um thank you representative wilson um there are a number of ways that youth get tobacco products certainly one of which is through retail outlets that may sell illegally this bill helps reinforce the message that that these products are illegal to you then they and they cover that additional set of devices that are non-electronic and used with great prevalence in our communities kids smoking hookah it's it's not a minor issue it's it's a major issue so they can currently purchase those things legally a hookah pipe for example so i'm not really answering your question definitively but i would say illegal sales still do happen the signage as addressed earlier would would potentially reduce some of that confusion about it but there are a lot of things that still can be done to reduce youth tobacco use including you know making these changes in in this current legislation and there's more that can be done as well representative wilson thank you madam chair and and i agree there's lots of things that could be done like banning tobacco try that one but that's not going to happen um but in the in the fiscal note each one of the areas talks about whether it's revenue expenditures the local government impact everything said minimal minimal minimal so if the impact is minimal why why i guess my question is why don't we simply enforce the statute there those are on the books because i'm not saying where's my witness go there i think the stores are doing an excellent job i think they're doing an excellent job once it goes outside that door that's where the problem is and for us to say local government impact is going to be minimal that's assuming they're not going to do anything about this either that's my frustration with it and i don't see changing a statute or making a new statute out of one that's already addressing what we're talking about totally is going to make a difference we should be addressing the enforcement piece of that so i don't think there's a question in that i'm sorry and i don't know if there's a comment there miss bibaret thank you madam chairman thank you representative wilson i actually would um beg to differ with respect to the language as it's currently proposed and amended that that the striking of the word electronic does make a difference that's different that's not under current legit it's not under the current law um the way the law is now so striking the word electronic covers those devices that are readily available to kids um and are being used like again hookah pipes and other devices that are not electronic so that that is it makes a difference at the local level and i i really am not equipped and i apologize for for commenting on the fiscal impact um or the or really even much of the enforcement my apologies representative conte thank you madam chair i'm looking on here by your own testimony most like virtually all of the hookah products have tobacco a small number of them also add nicotine so by striking the words cigarettes and tobacco as we do on page 3 line 12 as we do on page 3 line 16 as we do all over the place how is that would that not make a majority of the hookah products that are out there legal and simply the ones that contain nicotine illegal thank you madam chair if i understand correctly the issue has to do with the device is used to inhale so a hookah pipe does not contain tobacco but it can be purchased and used to smoke sure tobacco and other things familiar that i would like with hookah so i said i'm more familiar than i would like to be with hookah um so i'm surprised i don't know my understanding is that striking again the word electronic is a separate section from that definition so that previously or currently i guess um currently um a young person could purchase a hookah pipe and use it now yes they by law would not be able to purchase hookah tobacco known as shisha but they can have a hookah pipe and get their hands on you know tobacco via other means so maybe a marginally beneficial um addition in terms of the the current statute but in in the eyes of the folks who are working in the field we see so many young people using hookah and and going to hookah bars even under 18. so we're we're hopeful that you would consider this is a beneficial component of this bill any other questions for miss baberet representative shaffer thank you madam chair thank you miss beverett for coming in thank you miss vivret for coming in from jefferson county uh thank you for your efforts to reduce these habits among our children i've i'm looking through your exhibit here and all these manufacturers r.j reynolds arriva jackpot camel are they all available especially these little tablets are these sold in convenience stores the ariva and this is the type of dissolvable you're talking about is that correct it's not electronic is that correct it's favorite thank you madam chair and thank you um representative schaefer the um the definition and i apologize i'm not as uh vassal with the legalese of the bill but as i understand it the way that the definition of tobacco reads there's part a which has to do with um so on page three it says you know a product that contains nicotine or tobacco or is derived from tobacco and is intended to be ingested or inhaled or applied to the skin of an individual and then the second part is any device that can be used to deliver nicotine to the person inhaling from the device so line number pardon me do you have a line yes uh 27 on page three and uh number uh line number one oh the device is can be used to deliver right on line number 27 page three and then on to page four line lines one and two electronics so i'm sorry can you repeat your question please i apologize representative thank you madam chair no i am thank you i um these are examples of dissolvables right right yes and i could purchase these at my local or my teenager could go buy these at the local mobile station or any other station his favorite thank you madam chair um and representative schaefer um there's great variability in their in their uh in their presence in in local retail outlets there's i know if i if i heard correctly i heard that um senator nicholson was able to purchase all of the dissolvables in a store in netherland many diverse products are available some places you see again electronic cigarettes and other devices you see you can see you can purchase hookah pipes for example in a gas station um they are it's diverse it's yeah okay thank you very much okay are there any other questions for miss vigorette seeing none thank you for your testimony today we have one final witness against the bill mr hours would you join us at the table please and say your name and who you represent [Applause] good afternoon madam chair my name is rj hours and i'm with the american cancer society cancer action network and i'm here today to speak in opposition to senate bill 18. but first i want to say on behalf of my organization acs can and our tobacco control partners i want to sincerely thank representatives hamner and young for their work on tobacco control and their concern about the use of cigarettes and tobacco products and nicotine products by the young people of colorado i also want to say we we deeply appreciate their efforts on on this the american cancer society cancer action network uh does now and has previously held concerns about the potential unintended consequences of senate bill 18 it's our position that these changes are are not necessary from a public policy or a public health perspective at this time among the tobacco control community acs can has chosen not to support senate bill 18 as it was introduced in the senate and amended in the senate our partner organizations are neutral on the bill so that's just one distinction there i want to thank the sponsors again for bringing this issue of youth and tobacco and nicotine forward and uh with that uh thank you madam chair there any questions for mr hours i was just you know represented schaefer well thank you man i'm sure i was just wondering mr hours why are you opposed to senate bill 18 given all the work you've done to prevent more minor use mr owers matt thank you madam chair representative schaefer we believe that current statute does adequately include coverage for the products that that we do deal with some of the alternative nicotine containing products that you all have had a look at today to my knowledge the nicotine there is derived from tobacco some of these dissolvable products even contain tiny flecks of tobacco um so we we believe the current definitions would would cover that adequately thank you so mr hours um you mentioned part of the reason you're against it is because of unintended consequences what would what kind of unintended consequence could there be for clarifying the law madam chair there are products i know hookah was mentioned a few moments ago there are combustible products available that do not contain uh tobacco or they're not tobacco products they don't contain nicotine and that's just one example of something we wouldn't want to see perhaps de-emphasized as something for youth we also with some of the proposed language as was alluded to earlier by representative conte i believe there are about 28 instances where the word cigarette is would be deleted from statute by this bill if passed we believe that that keeping terms like that of current products as well in front of the consumer in front of retail clerks etc is important in that the importance of of educating youth and others about the dangers of tobacco not be lost through omitting current products uh while trying to incorporate newer products and i know in the senate the word tobacco was reinstated uh and would remain in state law but we we still do have that concern about cigarettes being omitted in the future so you'd be happy if cigarettes was put back in he would support the bill i couldn't go so far as to say we would be able to support the bill but we would be much more relieved if a word like cigarette was left in statute thank you representative conte question for the bill sponsors if what we're seeking is clarity in the statute why is cigarette continually been stricken representative hamner representative young thank you madam chair and i just want to assure the committee that this is the first conversation that i've had with the american cancer society and would be willing to visit with them and see if there is some way to amend the bill that would also meet the needs of what happened in the senate so i i can't directly answer that question today great thank you are there any other questions for mr hours thank you for your testimony today thank you madam chair thank you okay that concludes the list of people who've signed up to testify on senate bill 18. is there anyone else in the room that would like to testify who's not signed up seeing none the witness phase is closed are there thank you available chair members uh you know that we've had a lot of questioning about the bill and current statutes i reflect back to my first year in the legislature i ran a bill not related at all to tobacco use it was a dui bill it was a simple recodification of the current statutes and what does that mean it means that we analyze the situation at street level and realize that our constituents our citizens could not really understand the laws as they were written and we didn't make a substantive change to the laws but we were organizing them who were those citizens that were drivers certainly but it was law enforcement it was a criminal offense it was da's it was judges and sometimes we spend so much time here looking at our bills and looking at the statutes we assume everybody else understands them to the depths that we do and in fact that isn't always the case and i think today what we've heard is that in fact a large number of people in our communities don't really understand what our statutes say around this and and this bill while it does make some substantive changes really does try to make an effort to clarify our intent and our intent is that we do not want children under the age of 18 to have access to tobacco and nicotine products and hopefully this bill you will agree in fact does that kind of clarification and will provide our retailers and others with the clarity that they need to do a better job of ensuring that our children don't get those products thank you madam chair and i want to thank everyone who came to testify for and against the bill today and for all of you for listening and asking really great questions i was really impressed with all the questions and um i guess i'm um also wishing that we could do a little more with enforcement and i appreciated representative wilson's comments there i do want to call you your attention to a part of the bill that doesn't um doesn't prohibit a local community from taking action in addition to what is seen in this bill and i think it's one of those situations where you know should the state make the change or should we empower the local counties and cities and towns to go beyond the scope and the bill does allow that to happen i encourage them the local decision makers to do that to do what is necessary to adequately enforce the policies and the laws that we pass as a state but i do believe that what this bill does it offers clarifying language and i i think it also raises this issue to a new level of awareness and i certainly hope that our local elected officials take it to heart as well so thank you we're trying to see if representative mccann wants to come vote but i i was uh sort of surprised when the american cancer society came out today against the bill i do think mr ours makes a really valid point i think the street term is cigarette and you know there may be a convenience store clerk who doesn't understand maybe that a cigarette contains tobacco products so i think for second reading maybe that would be something i appreciate representative hamner's willingness to work on that and i'm sure representative young as well so i think she's the only member so we can take a brief research uh mr or representative young would you like to move your bill it would be to the committee the whole thank you madam chair i move senate bill 18 to the committee of the whole with a favorable recommendation second okay we're going to take a brief recess to see if we can get representative mccann over here to vote she's presenting a bill yes public health and human services will now come back to order we had a brilliant thought by our two bill sponsors to open up the amendment phase again so the amendment phase is open and we will lay it over to work on an amendment regarding what the american cancer society is concerned about and then for action at another meeting so did you just learn something else we're all about collaboration all right so with that public health and human services is adjourned all right i'm outta here

i'm sure i'd move that senate bill 1161 be returned with the due pass recommendation and we have one amendment um i would move would you like me to move that please that vice chair would move that seven line amendment dated 3 16 2010 at 1 pm be adopted good morning madam chairman and members for the record i am gina cash assistant analyst for the health and human services committee senate bill 1161 requires all registers in the state to register death certificates within 72 hours after receiving medical certification of death and the measure also instructs medical examiners to sign the medical certification of death within 72 hours may i explain the amendment please the seven line barto amendment dated march 16 2010 allows naturopathic doctors to sign death certificates and with that i'm available for questions thank you gina members do you have any questions for gina and then uh we have the sponsor senator gray would you like to explain the bill good morning man and chairman and members of the committee uh thank you for hearing the bill the reason that i brought the bill to you is that i had a constituent call me a couple years ago and said that she didn't know what to do her husband passed away her daughter had then passed away shortly after that time it had been four months and she did not have a death certificate for her daughter that had passed away and she didn't know where to go and so by a call to the medical medical examiner that has been a doctor of the day down here and lived in my district also i called and said what is the problem why can't we get a death certificate for this family and he made a few phone calls and within four days she had a death certificate and jan brown my constituent is here today to explain the process she went through and trying to get and her the death certificate so i was wondering well why don't we have a time frame i know in certain cases that when the medical examiner goes through an exam it takes a long time such as what we just read in the paper this morning that in the sweat lodge situation those three people they finally have a cause of death however there's there's no question when somebody passes away that they're dead and that's what i'm trying to get at let's get a death certificate to the family so they can begin to go through the process of closure and when you have to wait for a decision on what happens and the cause of death and getting a death certificate we can we should be able to bypass that and yes it takes sometimes takes a long time for that um yesterday i heard that there was a stakeholders meeting on changing the 72 days and i think the the language that the group had come up with was when the examination is complete 72 hours after completion of the examination well completion means what completion of the whole process the test that can take days and days so i don't think completion is the right word to use in the amendment and so i guess the other interesting thing is they had a stakeholders meeting but i wasn't invited when i did the legislation i went to the department of health and asked would you since you're the ones issuing the death certificate would you help me write the amendment and the language that they came up with is what is in the bill so i'm still willing to work with how we can determine this i think part of the question that they had in being on the 72 hours is is this working days so i'm willing to amend and say okay for if you want four working days instead of 72 hours i'm amenable to that so would ask that as we go through this process uh however we can work it i just believe that a family should have a death certificate even if it says pending the cause uh on that debt or death certificate but they need to have that as soon as possible for closure so i'd be glad to answer any questions that you might have members do you have any questions for senator graham [Music] it looks like 72 hours is already in the bill and in the original statute so is the change you're thinking is is the problem that 72 hours just isn't long enough and you're thinking that making it four business days would help them meet that 72-hour deadline or since i met him chairman since i wasn't in the stakeholders meeting i don't know the reasoning for that i'm so i hope that they are here to testify and maybe we could get some answers and work an amendment for the floor for that okay and i did talk to or email back and forth with a medical examiner dr king and he was hoping to be down here i'm not sure if he's here yet or has signed in uh on the bill but he also had a concern with the language on complete what does that mean so we need to examine that word which could delay if it means completion after all the medical diagnostic laboratory information comes in i would ask that you consider that as the bill moves forward and also i have jan brown to explain what happened okay members no questions thank you hear from jan brown representing herself welcome to committee good morning my name is janet brown and senator gray explained my daughter passed away in the april 2nd of 2007 she had had surgery on her knee five weeks prior she was 25 years old at the time and because it was she was so young and it was so sudden and she was healing um someone approached me called me and said would you like to have an autopsy you will not have to pay for it you know and i said yes i would like to know because i'm concerned for my other child please do that for me and to be honest so so much the details are a fog so i can't actually tell you exact dates but somebody called me and told me that it might take up to 90 days to get the results i it wasn't a financial reason i needed her death certificate but in when it started going into july and it had been past 90 days i was getting ready i work at a school and i was getting ready to go back to school for the school year in august and i said why is this taking so long i just need some closure excuse me and i didn't know who to talk to i didn't know who to call i didn't know who the middle medical examiner's boss was i didn't know if i should call the county attorney i didn't know what to do so i was really frustrated and i was talking with some friends we went out to lunch or something and we were all talking and a friend of mine said well why don't you call senator gray she lives in our neighborhood i have her phone number maybe she can tell you at least who to call or find out something for you so i called senator gray and she called me right back you know she was up in prescott and like she said within days i had a death certificate um the autopsy was not satisfying for me it did not really give a cause of death it said um extenuating uh problems that might have caused the death but it really didn't state the death so it that didn't help really but at least it gave me some kind of closure so senator gray asked me if i would come down and talk on why it's important i can't imagine if someone was waiting for insurance or they had to do something with their husband's estate or if it was financial the the ironic thing is my husband passed away the same year in on january 6 and he committed suicide and because it was so obvious his cause of death i had his death certificate in about four weeks something like that and that was very necessary for that i needed that but with my daughter where i didn't know it just dragged on for months and months and as you know you just need closure i needed closure but i can't imagine the  it would be if i were waiting on financial you know records and stuff that i couldn't move forward because i didn't have a death certificate like it could have been so do you have any questions like an answer thank you mrs brown i'm sorry it's just it's coming up on three years and it's just very difficult we appreciate you being here very sorry for your loss and it's um obvious that there's um there's an issue here and it's affecting real people yes and i'm sure it's not just me yeah yeah yeah and and i feel for the people and i know they have a heavy workload and i know they have cases that they need to that are suspicious circumstances or you know that that they have to have ready for court or i understand all those things but if you could have a death certificate at least issued that would be a big help i'm sure thank you again members do you have any questions for mrs brown thank you for taking the time to be here i think is difficult appreciate it okay [Music] mark barnes from the arizona naturopathic medical association uh like to speak in support of the amendment madam chairman members of the committee for records mark barnes with arizona naturopathic medical association uh we're here in support of the bar to amendment and thank senator gray for allowing you to consider attaching this to her bill right now under current law a nurse practitioner an md or a do can sign a death certificate a prime a naturopathic physician cannot under current law um the scope of practice for naturopathic physicians in in state law is very broad it's that of primary care physician naturopath physicians serve as primary care physicians for a lot of people throughout the state and it would make sense to allow them to sign a death certificate and um dr walker is here with me today she's been in practice as a naturopathic physician for several decades she runs a practice out of midtown phoenix and the um inability to sign a death civic has has caused um unnecessary stress on on the next of kin of people she has treated or people that have come into her office and she's just referred them to the hospital um so we think it's a good a good thing from a public policy standpoint to add uh to this bill and um be happy to answer any questions also if dr walker's available to um give you some real-life real-life examples of how this would help okay thank you mark any questions members for mark barnes thank you i think it would be helpful to hear from catherine walker dr walker available mr chairman thank you for your time welcome to committee thank you good morning madam chair and members of the committee my name is dr kathy walker and i'm a naturopathic physician i have a clinic in downtown phoenix along with my husband who is also a naturopathic physician and we have three other naturopathic physicians all full-time we have currently 16 000 active patients which means that we've seen them in the last two years generally when like say a pregnant female comes in to the practice as a patient we'll see her she'll eventually bring in her children she'll drag in her husband and she'll bring in her parents we actually do through the lifespan medicine we say womb to tomb that's not always nice to say but in essence in the last 10 years i've had over 30 cases where i've been presented with a death certificate that i could not sign many times i was the only physician of record once a physician of record cannot sign a death certificate the case actually moves on to the medical examiners and the patient is transferred to their office for either sign off or autopsy which is of course is at the county or state's expense um one case i can start with is a little elderly lady that came in with the chief complaint of my family doesn't like that i walk with a walker with talking with her i could easily see that she was in a lot of paint and on examination it was very clear that she was in end-stage breast cancer i advised the family to take her directly to the er with breast cancer in siege once you see it you never forget it and it's unmistakable but okay so i we sent her to the er the family did not take her to the emergency room the family took her home and that night she passed away in bed so first thing in the morning of course they found mom dead and they have to call the police at that point because they pass away at home that morning when i got to the office the policeman was there with the death certificate in hand waiting for me to sign it and had been waiting there for me for 45 minutes in that scenario i could not sign the death certificate and there was no other physician of record and it did get sent to the medical examiner's office another case is a 32 year old woman with uterine cancer that had metastasized from the kidneys she was a mother of three young girls and a loving husband that she left behind she had been in the hospital numerous times with renal problems but the cancer went undiagnosed by the time i diagnosed the cancer between the uterus and the kidneys it was a grim case she was reluctant to go back into the hospital situation because she felt like the hospitals let her down i took care of her out of my office and when she couldn't come into my office anymore i took care of her out of her home eventually as pain got worse and worse i brought in hospice and hospice and i worked hand in hand to take care of her through her final days upon passing again i was presented with a death certificate that i could not sign this patient had to be sent to the medical examiners an autopsy was performed which the family was adamantly against and it brought a lot of grief to this family another patient 98 years old she would come in once in a while my husband and i kind of shared that case she had a kind of crush on my husband i'm sure but she put up with me whenever she felt like she was running out of gas she would come in and fill her up so to speak which meant you know vitamin id or supplementation things like that when she finally passed she was in the loving embrace of her family and again we were presented with a burst or a death certificate that we could not sign and that case also had to go to the medical examiners again at the county of state's expense which had we been able to sign it would have been very easy we have documentation of chronic illnesses acute problems an obvious cause of death it's very simple anyone who signs death certificates goes through a cdc training program on how to sign death certificates nurse practitioners do it they have two years of post undergrad training i'm an rn first and then a physician second and mba in a couple weeks but if nurse practitioners can do it with their two years extra education and us going through four years of medical school we are primary care physicians in the state of arizona i do primary care medicine inclusive of allopathic and naturopathic medicine i follow the standards of both allopathic and naturopathic care and i just feel like i have more tools in my tool chest than the allopathics do i think it's totally reasonable that we'd be able to sign on the death certificates thank you dr walker members do you have any questions comments thank you for being here appreciate it thank you madam chair and members of the committee we have dwayne huffman here who signed in if needed numbers did you want to hear from anyone from the department of health on this bill okay question before you oh mr vice chair would you like to read into the record the rest of the people signed in uh yes i have there is one other individual richard bohan who is against the bill representing the maricopa county board of supervisors thank you members the question before you is excuse me i'm sure yes is that person in the audience uh one person who's against mr bohan yeah uh he wished not to speak oh that is against the bill chris you know why if he doesn't want to speak that's his option well uh maybe as senator gray had mentioned they're still working out the time frames and trying to solve the problem to make it uh trying to uh change the bill language so that it actually solves the problem um they're going to be dr king just came in the room we might give him a chance to uh to talk about the waiting period 72 hours dr keane would you like to address the committee on this issue good morning chairman members of the committee this is an issue which is the genesis of the problem is back not the two actual problems but one of the problems is whenever you have a death in which you don't know the definitive cause and you wind up with a pending cause of death or pending manner that is not an official guest certificate because it has to be resolved well anytime you have that situation families estate resolution is in limbo because they don't act upon a pending case and the pending resolution sometimes takes months in extraordinary cases where toxicology is quite complex or other involved investigation delays that final completion from the doctor's standpoint he's already signed the decision he signed it in a timely fashion but nothing happened because it's in this pending case so we've actually had anecdotally and i don't know the exact names of them but people have actually lost their homes because they couldn't get a death certificate in the timely fashion until people were moving forward on foreclosure for them and there are some other places minnesota being one example of the state where they have a document which they issue as an attestation an official document from the state that says john doe died on this date he's officially dead you can now close start the procedures of closing things out we'll get you a death certificate later well one of the problems in the state comes up with our electronic desk certification this would be a new step they said well it's a new document we don't want a new document well it's a pretty simple fix all you need to do is put one program step into your electronic desk certification you already have the data because when we as physicians sign the death certificate we've already said who it was when they died we're just like we don't know why yet [Music] if the word pending were to appear in either cause or manner you can kick out automatically and pre-print the language that says john doe died march 16 2010. he's officially dead you don't know why we'll tell you later why but he's now officially dead you can go forward with your banking your insurance and the state resolution and we'll get the final details later that was the genesis of that the other issue that's one issue the other is just a little shorter net is getting people to timely step to the plate and sign the death certificate um not too much of a problem in general in medical examiner's offices that happens pretty quickly not too much of a problem with a hospitalized death where you have a hospitalist who will sign even though it may not have been his face he's still covering for those the problem is the the quasi-attended unattended death that occurs at home and the doctor is taking care of them it's out of town he's not there and we we addressed this about three or four years ago in policy with trying to get people to sign within five days sometimes it happens sometimes it doesn't and so the languages try to put forward which is 72 hours semi-charged becomes a little problematic but you don't really want to water that down too much either and i think one way to maybe make that where we put the proper pressure on the people to do their job and still not delay everybody would be to adopt language along the lines of 72 hours accepting holidays that then would allow for those occasions where somebody died on a friday and nothing happened until tuesday morning you can still do it and not be violating any kind of pattern but it puts a little pressure to don't just put it on the desk and ignore it you have a duty yet to to fulfill please sign that that's sort of a nutshell where it comes from thank you dr keem any questions members i appreciate you being here today thank you any further discussion seeing none the question before you is the seven line regard to amendment dated 3 16 10 all in favor say aye aye all opposed nay the eyes appear to have it do

legislation is brought to our attention by the tobacco enforcement unit in our office of course we enforce the tobacco settlement and enforce uh youth access to tobacco statute so yeah this is a battery powered device that uses vapor deliver nicotine uh to smokers and it's a relatively new product and so it's a loophole in our existing statute we thought it was appropriate that the legislature make a statement that this type of product which is marketed as i guess as a way to wean people who are smokers away from cigarettes but it's also marketed to children in that it comes in various flavors and you can get them in a shopping mall uh kiosks and that sort of thing we want to make it clear that this is not an appropriate product for miners in the state of arizona so we ask

at 121 be adopted ingrid mr chairman committee members under your consideration is senate bill 1315 child care program and fees senate bill 1315 allows child care facilities and child care group homes to pay their annual licensing fees in installments per des procedures specifies that license or certification is valid upon the date of issuance unless revoked suspended for the licenses or the or the licensee does not pay the licensing or certification fees requires dhs to review its actual costs to administer this article by annually allows dhs to adjust refund credit fees if it is determined that administrative costs are lower than the fees the department has collected states that fee reductions are exempt from rulemaking provisions and requires dhs to conduct a study of its specific costs to administer these and provisions would you like me to explain the amendment ms barto please um the two-line barto amendment at 3 11 10 at 1 21 pm makes a technical correction and with that madam chairman i'm available for questions thank you members do you have any questions for ingrid okay seeing none we have bruce lickett from the arizona child care association welcome bruce thank you madam chair members of the committee um i understood that uh the sponsor senator sylvia allen might be stopping by also but got to call into her office so if i could briefly explain in a bit perhaps more detail what we're trying to achieve with um the bill i'm bruce lee get the executive director of the arizona child care association i represent businesses and non-profit that are licensed child care centers so we have faith-based child care providers and independently owned businesses all the large national companies and major non-profits like the ymca our members thank you for hearing the bill just briefly to put what we're trying to do in context i don't think any industry has been hit harder than child care in terms of the economy people with job loss people aren't working people are using child care and so many of our centers are operating at 30 and 40 percent of their license capacity the issue of the fees affects all licensed child care centers we knew the fees were low we followed the auditor general study that called for a thoughtful systematic review of how the fees are and what they ought to be done it moved quickly when the governor recommended virtually overnight to go to fully self-funded fees so the original fees that the health department identified to replace their lost general fund were astronomical increases up to thirteen thousand four hundred dollars um fortunately director will humble was i able to identify some other non-appropriated funds and come up with a really creative solution for developing a public health program that connected to licensed child care so we were really pleased with his effort there still the fees are high um highest in the united states even with the discount under in power so only five states in the country charge more than five hundred dollars uh for them so our fees at the highest level are three thousand nine hundred dollars for a three-year license um we understand the reality so this bill doesn't directly address the fees today we're trying to work within the parameters that we've been given here and so we do make no assumptions that the empowered discounts that are today provided and so important are going to be there for perpetuity they could go away so when i get calls from members saying well can we count on this in two or three years you know it's our understanding the department fully intends to but things change in government rapidly so that's a part of the context um in in terms of living with what we have um the bill really does just um a few things there's a couple areas where um we would like to develop some amendments in our discussions with dhs to fine-tune the bill but the first thing in kind of sequence is it requires a study of the costs just like the auditor general called for by the various functions that are in the statute so they do licensing they do enforcement they handle complaints they do training so this study would identify how much money it takes in each of those areas and it would involve us as regulated facilities it would um in the bill require that that study be done in april we've been in discussion with the health department about moving that date up a couple months so we can get it earlier next session um the second thing it does is require a revision to all the health and safety regulations without jeopardizing any health and safety issues for children of course but really streamlining them simplifying them and we've been working with the health department on that and we're well underway so um we're pleased with that but this bill would allow us to make those changes immediately um with the new streamlined health and safety regulations um third it requires the department to look at their costs every two years and if they are lower to make adjustments downward so we're kind of building in a culture of continuous review and change here um heaven forbid there would be even more centers going out of business but if there's a big drop off in the number of centers then those remaining shouldn't have to pay higher fees the department should make those kind of adjustments and that's what we're trying to do here is create that process fourth it gives dhs the flexibility to make those adjustments a lot of times agencies can't move quickly because they're statutory regulatory barriers and we try to address some of that so the bill says for example that dhs may allow installment payments based on procedures they were developed we don't envision this as creating a cash flow problem dhs would control that process but what it might do is allow dhs to give a center a bit more time to make installment payments so we wouldn't have to disrupt care for children it allows dhs to have the tools to do refunds or credit if the fees do become lower and what it also does is create a non-expiring license and this we discovered 12 other states do so nothing stops the state from removing a license for somebody who's not meeting the standards but we began to question why do we renew our license every three years and do the paperwork and the answer was because it's in statute so we think that's another process up a simplification that this bill would bring to bear we desire to move to annual payments child care is the only area in the health department where we have three year fee payments if you're trying to adjust fees look at your costs streamline your procedures and then implement reductions in a three-year cycle it's very complicated so this role as written now would change that to annual payments as dhs looked at the bill they said this is going to create a cash flow problem in the transition so we want to come back with an amendment madam chair that will address that to still keep the issue of annual payments alive like every other part of the health department but address the dhs concerns we hope to do that uh and finally the thing that is not in that we want to come back to the committee with is putting in permissive authority for dhs to continue the empower program um we just feel more confident that you know if funds are available that something statute clearly says dhs has the authority to do what they've been doing um so that's what we're trying to do man i'm sure i'd be happy to answer any questions thank you andrews do you have any questions for mr leggett i appreciate you being on mr boat mr leggett i just have a question in the statutory language in uh subsection r where it says the department shall review its actual cost to administer this article at least once every two years if the department determines that its administration's costs are significantly lower than the fees it is collected pursuant to this section it shall adjust fees and may refund or credit i guess my question is is significantly lower defined uh if so what is it and then the just that question of uh the department shall adjust and may refund or credit does that mean it's discretionary um madam chair uh representative volt um the idea was that if they do the cost study and and and the fees aren't significant and it's not specifically defined it's a concept but we thought if there's a dollar you know or ten dollars that if the costs would outweigh the implementation that certainly we wouldn't look for those fees to be adjusted but if they do the study and they find out that their costs are lower it does require if significant those to be adjusted and then as tools they may refund or credit somebody so it will be an either or they will either refund or they will credit because the way it's right now it says they they may refund or credit or it seems like the unspoken is or nothing at all uh manager representative i understand what you're asking as as written it clearly requires them to adjust the fees how they do that in terms of a credit uh or a repayment um would be the option for how they do it those would be the two tools they would have to do it if lower okay thank you thank you manager any other mr murphy thank you madam chair i don't know that this question is really for mr liggett um but maybe the sponsors here maybe she'll know or step on the this maybe the summary is just wrong but on the front of the summary it says that uh the fee reductions are exempt from the rulemaking provisions which you know makes sense i mean if you're if you've got a process in place and you're just tweaking the fees based on data going through rulemaking would be kind of silly but then the last thing on the back says exempts dhs from rulemaking requirements for one year after the effective date of this act that sounds really really broad to me and i didn't dig up in the in the bill the actual language but is that actually correct or is that overly simplified for the purposes of the summary because if it is i don't see why we need to exempt dhs from rulemaking for a year just to do this uh madam chairman mr murphy that last one you're referring to is session law that's in section five of the bill okay but i guess that still is my question why does all of dhs needs to be exempt from rulemaking requirements for one year just because of this bill um mr chairman uh representative murphy it says for purposes of this act oh okay and that's why again i didn't have the actual bill in front of me but the summary doesn't say that it just says we can type we it was in fact only specific to implementing this bill yeah and i'll tighten that up on the summary just just checking because that seemed really broad mr lux i don't know to whom to direct this question um but my question has to do with the fiscal note [Music] um klbc says that if we do what's proposed in this bill it'll be somewhere between a 260 000 and slightly more than half a million hit to the general fund there was a limit to that yeah mr liggett did you want to address that or we have the sponsor here as well okay uh madam chair uh mr loeps the bill is originally written had a provision where we were trying to delete the 10 additional charges we paid to the general fund it was clear in this environment that that's not the right time to address that issue so that's been removed so those costs no longer are valid in terms of that fiscal note what hasn't been changed what you're telling me there will be no impact to the general fund management mr lopes there's no impact to the general fund in this thank you thank you we do have the sponsor here would you like to add anything to the discussion at this point thank you madam chairman uh i'm senator selby allen from district five thank you committee members i'm not going to add any more i think uh mr leggett did a good job unless you have further questions it it it's way different than the original bill as we try to work through this problem i think the goal is we're trying to determine really how much the fees should be set at that's our responsibility i think and i had so many people call me from my district very alarmed at the increase in fees and i was very worried about many of my daycares are very small they're independently owned and this was a very hard hit to them so this is why we started down this journey and i think we've arrived at a solution here that will allow the department to do a study to see where we can really get at what these what it is costing to regulate these these child care centers and arrive at fair fees and that's the goal so thank you thank you i appreciate that too i've been hearing from a lot of people in i'm sure we all have since the fee increased uh went into effect um i have a question for i think uh dwayne huffman is he available thank you oh there you are great um when you're looking at when the uh you know making up this report and having uh doing the study how are you going to determine who's going to be involved in that study and have input into what regulations are really necessary and needed a great question i'm madam chair my name is duane huffman i'm the legislative liaison with the department of health services um let me answer that in two ways um speaking directly to the regulations as bruce mentioned we actually started a comprehensive review of the of the regulations that has involved um stakeholders across the child care community including mr liggett including several other folks in the child care industry and in the community and we're actually about ready to issue kind of the draft rules um as we've as we've reviewed them um and we're on track to put those out here in the next month or two and so speaking to who's looking at it the answer is as many people as we could get around the table to look at those rules and how we could simplify them speaking to the study that's in the bill about kind of our costs currently we are putting all of the i.t effort we can right now into developing what's known as a time and effort system where we can track the time and effort that our surveyors and administrative staff and everybody puts into specific tasks and facilities so that we can then analyze the data to find out how much we spend on different types of facilities different types of activities including enforcement including trainings other things like that and we will then be using that data to figure out where significant cost savings may be achieved we've talked about finding a third party to help us review that because obviously we feel currently that we are efficient as anybody who does anything feels that they are we'll acknowledge that there's always room for improvement but we see value in having someone else kind of help us figure out where the efficiencies could be as well speaking directly about you know the small child care facilities like run out of the home are you going to reach out to specific people that licensees and ask for their input or is there a way to get these people to the table as well um chairman bartel i haven't been um at the table per se as far as the the rules um makeover bruce has maybe he'll be able to speak to exactly who's there but but we have tried to reach out to every sector of the industry including the large centers the group homes the school districts um the faith-based industries we've tried to get everybody that we could dwayne i just i'm curious about some of the regulations where do they where do they originate are some of them straight from the federal government and then we just have no choice but to include them in our regulations i've i just um i'm curious because i happen to be walking my district on saturday and one of the people i happen to knock on their door she runs childcare out of her home and said that inspectors were there just that week i think it was the day before and they had uh recently come down with a new regulation saying that they had to cover their lantana plants with netting because they were poisonous i'm just curious about where these things come do they come out of thin air or do you um with them or chairman barton mostly thin air i'm not aware you got your i'm not aware of federal regulations or laws per se most of it has just been built upon years upon years of different issues coming up and each time an issue has come up or a child's been endangered somebody's gone in and changed the rules um since director humble has come into the department of health services um there's been a large emphasis in a culture of change at dhs to help the surveyors realize that they're not there to enforce every rule but they're there to protect health and safety that they're going to use those rules as their toolkit and how to do that we've seen some success we're still pushing to that obviously changing attitudes of surveyors isn't an overnight thing but we're working at it we're working at changing the rules but most of it comes from past experiences involving health and safety of children so just to clarify there are no federal regulations that uh direct you in what you demand from licensees um chairman barton not that i'm aware of now um once again bruce is probably more familiar with the rules than i am i'm sure that we we look to some standards in some areas but overall i'm not aware of federal child care requirements thank you i'm sure my my recollection when i was at dhs was child care regulations unlike hospital regulations which we do for medicare uh child care regulations are not are not dictated by the federal government as i recall they're all all done so lucia they're all done by us [Music] thank you duane we have quite a few people signed in for the bill uh mr boone thank you madam chair thank you uh for signed in for the bill not wishing to speak down isaacson representing the valley of the sun ymca also signed in in favor of the bill uh representing itself is kathleen pagels um also signed in for the bill not wishing to speak john wayne gonzalez representing the city of phoenix there's probably a story behind that name i'd like to hear some time also signed in for the bill not wishing to speak dale y bush representing the league of cities and towns and also in favor of the bill not wishing to speak signed in is kevin dimena representing arizona child care association thank you members do you have any further discussion or comments i'd just like to make a comment i appreciate that the sponsor bringing forth this bill i think it's way past time that we give them authority and some direction on how to uh put some common sense regulations in place here emotion degree oh actually we are um mr vice chair we're going to withdraw the motion and members just in our discussions um with the stakeholders on how many changes have to be made um before this bill moves forward we thought it best to hear the bill and discuss it here in committee but actually vote on it next week because it's quite a lengthy amendment and we wanted to be able to thoroughly vet it before moving it to the floor and reduce any confusion about what we're trying to do in the bill so if you have discussion about that i'd be happy to talk further about that but we're going to withdraw the motion and uh vote on it next week madam chairman i'd just like again to kind of reiterate uh my points that i think somewhere in there there could be some sort of definition of significantly lower uh rather than just kind of the language floating out there and you know there is some sort of explanation of what the what the process is if it's an official cost benefit analysis or what's going to be done to really determine what significantly lower is and then also just that language on um it shall adjust fees and may refund i just think that if it could be written a little bit more clearly that it will be an either or you will either get a refund or you will get a credit i think that will help with the interpretation of the language mr vote i appreciate that any further comments do you want formal motions to withdraw those or just go on to the next bill i think we need to formally withdraw okay i would uh madam chair would withdraw the uh motion to adopt the two-line bartow amendment to senate bill 1315 and also withdraw my motion uh that senate bill 1315 will receive a due pass recommendation thank you and we don't need to vote on that do we okay next bill next bill please thank you madam chair i would move that senate bill 1152 be returned with the new pass recommendation mr boone gina madam chairman of members last year the legislature passed senate bill 1209 which was the bill of rights for children and youth and foster care act governor brewer signed the bill and requested that the legislature clarify that the rights outlined in sb-1209 do not establish a cause of action and are not

medical support order terminates specifying that if the private insurance terminates the cash medical support order automatically resumes by operation of law on the first day of the month following the termination date of the policy and allowing administrative review of a medical support notice to include whether the other parent is already providing medical insurance for the child per court order and whether the cost of the insurance is reasonable and with that mr chairman members i'm available for questions remember is there any questions of inquiry being done great job thank you very

gina great job no questions very thorough um the sponsor i still don't see the sponsor for this bill senator for sure here um 11 senate bill 1113 has no one signed in in favor or in opposition i guess that means we can't take action public doesn't have an opinion on this one uh members any other questions on senate bill 1113. you guys are making it way too easy seeing them secretary calderon mr atlas sir yes mr bradley aye mr ford this is good hi mr lopez aye mr murphy aye mr vogue hi this is barto mr boone hi thank you members by your vote of 7i zero and a zero present and two absent you

testing allows either party to apply for summary judgment on the issue of paternity requires state and local agencies that have custody of a person who is the subject of another state's genetic testing order to comply with the order and provide civil and criminal liability immunity for local and state agencies agency employees or agency contractors act in good faith to cooperate in obtaining genetic testing samples and with that i'm available for questions thank you members any questions of gina uh i'm sorry representative abolisher thank you mr boone gina does this have does this connect to the legal designation of parental rights for the children i mean is that what is that what we're touching on is being being able to establish who has legal rights yeah mr chairman representative ableiser i would think that they would have to establish who's the parent before they determine who has rights so mr officer thank you mr boone so essentially this this um change allows a mother to help find who their father could be in the future and and would enable her assistance if she needs support for the child and the father is unknown mr chairman representative apple sir i believe that's correct thank welcome thank you remember any other questions of gina thing then um senate bill 1114 has no one signed in in favor or in opposition to the bill uh members any further discussion on

department of housing first because that's a directorship and um this was put on the agenda incorrectly so we will begin with michael dell trailer arizona department of housing this is for the director of the department of housing good afternoon madam chairman and members of the committee my name is michael traylor and it's an honor and a privilege to stand before you today and ask for your confirmation of my appointment to the arizona department of housing i was born and raised in phoenix arizona i'm a third generation home builder and i've been responsible for building over ten thousand houses in arizona uh in doing that i've created and analyzed uh hundreds of performance and feasibility studies for projects and considering that about 80 percent of the department's act

united way we are going to make measurable progress ending chronic homelessness in our state thank you and again it's an honor and a privilege to stand before you today and i hope that you find me worthy of the position here are their questions thank you thank you before i make this motion i would like to recognize some constituents that attended a luncheon today sponsored by the right to life and the united families of arizona groups they had a nice uh luncheon over in the executive tower so if they're there could we recognize them if they're not here let's still there they are they are out there hi constituents okay hey the motion please since you clapped i'm gonna make that motion for you not lucky you clapped all right it's tough committee michael uh has a very good reputation i'm very pleased to make the nomination so i move that the senate commerce committee recommended the full senate the confirmation of michael dale trailer as the director to the arizona department of housing thank you this called the role that's right i've got the motions here so i didn't get the script hi oh senator mccann hi senator hi senator hi senator fisher hi hi you're recommended to the full senate confirmation of michael dale traylor to be the director of the arizona department of housing thank you very much thank you for coming okay members we'll go back to the actual agenda so the next um would be the state board of appraisal michael trouba if i've mispronounced your name just correct it when you come up sorry good afternoon madam chair senators my name is michael trouba and i'm here for a nomination to the appraisal board and i appreciate your consideration uh if you have any questions are there any questions and for me okay senator mcdavis madam chair i would personally like to hear from the nominees in terms of their point of view on the performance of the appraisal board there are concerns in the both in the industry and in the community about the board and i'd just like to hear a comment or two from the nominees uh i am been appointed to one of the the public uh positions on the board uh however i am the chief credit officer of the community bank in tucson arizona our bank has a concentration in commercial real estate loans which majority of arizona banks do we're in a difficult time right now because of of appraisal valuations it's it's difficult to determine valuations for one thing lack of sales and of course the the economy in general so i think it's just more important than ever that the rules and guidelines that are stipulated by the board of appraisal are adhered to so that the integrity of the reports are what's expected for a sound credit underwriting on the residential side we do we do residential loans but but very few this might not be the venue but we have heard complaints with the centralized appraisal process because they're basically put out to bid so what happens in that case is there could be a phoenix appraiser doing a tucson appraisal and i've heard complaints from the community the mortgage community the real estate community just because they're not they don't feel that they're qualified to be doing appraisals outside of the market area and of course that has to do with fha type loans thank you any other questions thank you senator training remove the nomination please thank you i moved the senate commerce and economic development committee recommended the full senate the confirmation of michael trouba to be a member of the state board of appraisal thank you please call the role carolyn allen aye mr chevron aye remember aye you have recommended to the full center the confirmation of michael chuba be a member of the state board of appraisal thank you thank you for coming state board of appraisal again myra laverne jefferson good afternoon madam chairman and fellow members of the committee my name is myra jefferson and i'm here to request your support and to confirm me as a returning board member to the appraisal board my background is loan originations as well as real estate development and financial forensics where i investigate foreclosed mortgages or defaulted mortgages on behalf of the insurance company she asked the question about the value of the appraisal board the appraisal board has changed over the years as the industry has changed one of the things that has happened is there have been complaints about the board's performance and how stringent or or relaxed we are in um reviewing appraisals but we have followed the criteria that we had set before us and sometimes the public has the impression that we have more power than we do and that's unfortunate but we have to educate the community we have had public meetings and educational workshops in different areas of the state to familiarize our constituents as to what the appraisal board is about and what an appraiser can and cannot do i hope that you will see fit to reappoint me and i really thank you for the time thank you for the questions seems like just yesterday we did your appointment the first time around are there any questions great thank you okay um stay up until just different other minute senator

you okay there is one bill on the agenda today senate bill 1053 laura is going to present oh they're starting you out fast this is madam chairman members of the committee for the record my name is flora sarder and i am the research intern for commerce and economic development senate senate bill 1053 prohibits a person from knowingly selling or furnishing electronic cigarettes to a miner prohibits a miner from knowingly accepting or possessing electronic cigarettes and defines electronic cigarette as a battery-powered device that provides a vaporized vaporized solution of nicotine a violation of the prohibitions is regarded as a petty offense madam chairman members of the committee i'd be happy to answer any questions before before anybody does i didn't bring the computer one bill and so i don't have a list of who wants to testify so if anybody who wants to testify would just put it in writing like we used to do or let me know if you can come up and we'll do it afterwards i'll make sure i have the computer with me from now on so thank you other questions for flora unless you can get it for me okay thank you well i know greg stanton is here i'm sure he's oh senator alan do you want to speak to your bill before we have greg come up oh thank you madam chairman well it was brought to me um i had no idea that there were electronic cigarettes on another galaxy far far away when i was a little girl we had these candy cigarettes we played pretend but this is not really play pretend and i was very very taken back and would be happy to sponsor this and everybody that knows me knows how bad i really how much i really dislike my husband smokes so much so let's don't start these kids off trying to develop a bad habit thank you senator ellen truth the um candy cigarettes didn't have nicotine that's right he's have nicotine that's right greg stanton from the attorney general's office brought the bill please speak to us madam chair and greg sent from the attorney general's office with me is nicole harris who was one of our attorneys in the youth access uh uh division of our upper office the only thing i want to add to what staff had said about this issue is that these things these electronic cigarettes which probably are better called nicotine delivery systems um they come in various flavors chocolate mint uh fruity flavors uh et cetera they're sold in kiosks and over on over the uh over the internet so youth right now have great access to them and that's the exact point of this is say this type of product uh should not be available to uh uh to youtube added to our youth access uh statute we do have a little show and tell going on as the senator is looking at it it looks like a pen other versions of it actually look like a cigarette if you were to puff on that that one's ready to go if you uh enjoy i'm not a smoker myself but it would light up the front of it would kind of light up and it would look physically like a uh like a cigarette um uh greg where do they um i mean is it do they come preloaded or can are these reusable or once you use it once okay son excellent question you can unscrew that and a portion of it you would plug in and then a portion of it with the nicotine would be replaceable uh and then you put it back in there so parts of it are you have to continue to buy the the product a part of it is uh permanent in fact they doing my holiday shopping i was in the mall kiosk and saw it and went over to kind of ask you questions at least the one that i uh saw uh ran about 129 dollars so they are they are fairly uh expensive i don't know how much replacement parts uh are at least that's the initial uh the initial cost of them but yeah they are sold in places where children would have easy access to them it has different flavors but at all it all has it all has nicotine in it correct it's it is in some cases marketed as a way to sort of wean yourself adults who are active smokers to wean themselves off smokers but obviously when you're uh have different flavors uh to it uh intentionally or not uh it certainly is attractive to uh to teenagers and younger folks and that's what we want to get at in this issue but does it have less nicotine than a cigarette i just wonder nicole who may know more on that i don't know the answer to that question it does the cartridges that you can buy you can buy them in different nicotine levels so from regular to light and they're supposed to have one cartridge it doesn't contain nicotine but it may contain a little bit so that explains the weaning off since we continue to come back and and add more um items to the list of what cannot be marketed or sold to children as the market changes have you thought about making doing an amendment and adding nicotine products to this so every time something new comes on the market we don't have to come back and change the law or they get our products containing nicotine i think uh a man of chair uh i think at least from the attorney general's office perspective we would happily uh support such an amendment uh man chairman i think that we would need to review what they are and certainly i don't like to see children smoking cigaret or any kind of tobacco a lot of young people uh when they start to play ball i start this chewing business etc so that was actually my point since we've already done this with chewing tobacco another if we just add a category in addition that says nicotine containing products then we've covered all of them before the marketplace comes up with something new because the issue is because this wasn't specifically um against the law then they've been able to sell it so we would cover a lot by adding that something like that in addition to the language so senator fisher okay did you want to say something and you're not sure again for sure yeah madam chair and greg don't we already have um statutes uh in prohibiting inhalants and how come this couldn't be um taken care of under that statute you know because i know there's other things um i know there's an incense out there now that kids are buying to uh get high on okay i don't i'm going to turn it over to the expert on that question madam chair and senator for sure i think we we decided to include this in the youth access because it's similar to a cigarette um it's kind of grouped in with a cigarette although it's electronic it contains nicotine nicotine is derived from tobacco so we kind of wanted to keep those all together that's why we decided to just include it under our youth access law which we do go out and do inspections and so we could do inspections for sales of this product also so madam chair this this couldn't come under something like like where we have prohibited them from you know selling paint or uh some of these other chemicals too it probably could but i we didn't look into that route i didn't even consider that route we kind of just considered okay okay thank you hey um other questions okay we do have um senator payton has his computer he will he will read people who want to come up and speak but i wanted to i wanted to have tim baskey come for the american heart association did you want it you wanted to speak okay thank you madam chair members of the committee my name is tim baskey with the american heart association uh the american heart association we're taking a neutral position on senate bill 1053. it's a position of the american heart association that these devices should not be sold until the fda has a chance to properly evaluate the products and deem whether they're safe for consumer use and to our understanding that it's not happened yet we do understand though that for the fda we do understand though that while the fda continues its efforts to enact tougher our regulation of this product the oversight of electronic cigarettes is certainly warranted many brands of these products are found to possess known carcinogen and the products all result in the release of unknown elements in the form of vapor or smoke more directly the use of electronic smoking devices can serve as a mechanism to maintain a smoker's addiction as well as initiate new smokers to the destructive habit many electronic cigarettes are marketed with you foreign flavors as have been discussed and flavored tobacco products pose a particular threat to young people um more importantly though the american heart association are is concerned regarding the permanent use of electronic cigarettes and the threat it has to our smoke-free law or clean indoor air law since these devices are marketed to mimic the appearance of a cigarette it could cause stress for the owners of those businesses if they're not sure if someone is smoking or not as well as though for any enforcement when they come in if they recognize that this is a smoking if they're actually smoking a cigarette or an electronic cigarette so once again the american heart association we are neutral on this uh given the fact that we would rather wait to have these products available to consumers until the fda had a chance to and that actually doesn't make any sense to me that it would be that you would be neutral on something we're talking about youth access is something that you've clearly stated is dangerous whether the this doesn't undo what the fda is going to do it might be really odd that you wouldn't say no matter what the fda does and hopefully they will do it it will be outlawed completely where it's going to keep children away from this and i understand where you come from that and our belief is that by providing uh saying you know 18 or older or restricting access to 18 or younger are you making this legitimate a product when the fda still hasn't claimed this is a legitimate product for consumer consumption so is the state granting this as a legitimate product when the fda hasn't even weighed on on that fact yet yes and for sure a case i i guess i'm sure what you're saying is by by making this prohibiting this to youth we're kind of putting a stamp approval on it for adults is that the position you're kind of taking for sure i guess and or the american heart association position is that right now that this hasn't been deemed safe for anyone to use adult or a child just when i read the bill i don't see where it says it's safe for anybody but it just says you can't sell it to a child it's not illegal to sell it right okay any questions i i do have a question he brought up the i'm sure he brought the clean air act and i don't know if it's necessary for him or maybe for greg so someone could use could we have a statewide ban on smoking and restaurants and so forth and so on so someone could smoke one of these in one in a restaurant without violating that do you want to come back up thank you tim um madam chair uh senator for sure and i think uh the folks from the healthcare community uh uh would probably verify this i think the honest truth is that we don't there haven't been definitive studies on exactly what smoke is being emitted from these electronic uh cigarettes and so there hasn't been the test case about whether or not this would be in violation of the state uh uh smoking ban and not having to talk to the attorney general on that particular question i'm not sure what official i have a sense of what he'd probably say on that but uh we haven't taken a definitive position whether or not someone's smoking these in public because you do admit smoke uh with the violation of the state uh uh state uh smoking smoking ban maybe restaurant owners in the uh in the room may have a different uh opinion [Laughter] all right thank you thank you okay um we have dwayne huffman in case needed from representing department of health services wait joined up and that he was neutral on the bill as department of health service that was only if needed but there was there was a gentleman there was a colby bower representative representing american cancer society i will have kobe in a minute there's a there was another constituency buffalo yeah he did not need to speak oh for the record would you just read it against i'll read them all just that one we've got the other buffalo rick galener representing himself um is against the bill not wishing to speak is he here he doesn't want to speak anyway okay well kobe bauer american cancer society come on up he does wish to speak he's also neutral on the bill thank you madam chair for the record my name is colby bower and i'm representing the american cancer society cancer action network and we represent the american cancer society on policy issues like this i'm going to come up here and fly the big neutral flag also very very for very much the same reasons that the american heart association has for for being neutral but i do want to clear up uh some things and just sort of walk the committee through because i don't think this is the first time we're going to see e-cigarettes issue come up and so i wanted to educate the committee a little bit on what they are you guys have all seen the product um these things are being aggressively marketed right now if you check your your spam folder in your email box it's probably full of that and some other pharmaceutical products uh but and of course they're in the mall kiosks and being aggressively marketed also to kids i also i want to take the opportunity to uh to recognize senator allen's history on issues like this and we certainly our neutrality is in no way uh trying to um take away from your intent on this we think it's certainly a noble goal to to keep these out of the hands of kids but i do want to say that um similar uh to mr vasquee um there's no evidence this is that these products are safe for anybody and i think that's a moral dilemma that this committee and perhaps the body needs to figure out the fda has done some some very small lab tests on two of the products including the enjoy product that was passed out earlier they found carcinogens they also found antifreeze and also nicotine so you know the question you should maybe ask yourself is does this committee come back and say we think it's okay for adults to inhale antifreeze and not kids or vice versa and to the fda regulation i know there was a few questions on that i think it's a very relevant topic the fda regulates pretty much everything from lip gloss to dog food to anything you put in your body or can be accidentally put in your body by way of consumption and yet these the makers of e-cigarettes have not submitted to fda testing currently they're in a court battle with with the fda the fda is attempting to regulate them uh much in the same way that they regulate other drug delivery devices but they uh and and currently a judge ruled that they cannot regulate them as a drug delivery device leaving the door open for them to regulate them as a tobacco product even though they don't really contain any tobacco they just contain chemicals derived from tobacco which i would like to point out to the committee also opens up a whole great pandora's box if it is in fact a tobacco product should the state be taxing it like we tax other tobacco products should we be regulating it uh in terms of enforcement like other tobacco products those are just some issues that i think are going to come forward and on the clean indoor air ban the american cancer society cancer action network feels that these should be implicitly included in any clean indoor air uh laws that there's nothing really written into our current one i'm not sure how how the the state will want to move forward with that but we would certainly support any sort of bill that would include these explicitly in our laws so with that i want to leave some some time for questions i can also tell you what other states have done the attorney general in oregon for instance has banned these products via court order essentially any non-fda approved nicotine delivery device um and then and then another organization campaign for tobacco-free kids which is probably on the cutting edge for keeping tobacco out of the hands of children has recommended that state legislatures actually take a proactive approach and pass laws banning all non-fda approved nicotine delivery devices that's not necessarily our position but i do want to throw that out there to the committee and i'll be happy to answer any questions but you said there's no nicotine in these though no there is there there absolutely is nicotine in them in fact and in in there's just no tobacco i mean nicotine is a naturally occurring chemical um it's actually in quite a few fruits and vegetables um it's just really concentrated of course in tobacco uh that another chemical is also in the e-cigarettes is derived directly from tobacco although technically there's no tobacco in them so it you know i like to tell people they're sort of operating in this gray area it's not a tobacco product they have not submitted uh to fda testing you know if you think about the patch and the gum all those other nicotine replacement products those are all fda approved and those are regulated for consumer safety and e-cigarettes is not submitted to those testing so we don't know what they do long-term we just know they contain things like antifreeze what's in what is what's in the um patches that's different than what's in here for the fda to have chosen to regulate the patches and the gums well it's not the fda is attempting to regulate e-cigarettes right now and it's it's currently in federal court on how they can regulate it whether they regulate it through like a consumer product or whether they regulate it as tobacco well that was the question i was asking if the patches don't have tobacco either right the gum doesn't have tobacco either yet they've already chosen to regulate those why would why wouldn't this the fda why wouldn't this have been automatic under that same category the fda is suing to make that happen it just it it just hasn't happened yet i mean excuse me the fda is not suing e-cigarettes assuming the fda the fda attempted to regulate them okay and e-cigarettes said no we don't fall under any of your categories and it's currently in federal court then there's issues too about whether the fda should be regulating some herbal products and vitamins that and other products on the market that can be very dangerous to people and there's no regulation on any of those as well okay senator for sure yeah i'm sure part of the part of my question was answered so in that regulation so that the gum and the patch those things are prohibited from being sold to minors also yeah and and in fact there's even a product out there nicotine gel which is sort of a novel product where you just sort of rub it on my canvas they're actually regulated by the fd they submitted to testing and are properly regulated and the fda regulates pretty much everything i mean you know whenever you know you hear about these dog food scares because there's i mean that's the fda i mean they regulate everything and yet this is a product explicitly designed for a consumer to put into their body into their lungs and the fda has not done any testing because they haven't been allowed to hey other questions it's probably too much information but actually it's extremely helpful i i offer myself as a resource for for any member that wants to move forward with amendments um you know i would echo uh madam chair your sentiment that we should probably be more inclusive the marketplace uh is a really dynamic thing and you have everything from uh e-cigarettes to the nicotine gel uh infused water now being sold in arizona um so there's lots of great products out there to keep people hooked on nicotine but i offer myself as a resource should anybody need me thank you questions hey i believe that's everybody who has signed in um senator training will you move the bill please yes you want to move the bill okay go ahead okay i move senate bill 10 53 with the due pass recommendation thank you if there's no further discussion please follow the rule and chairman explaining my vote uh i do appreciate the information that which has been brought forward today the fda in my opinion does not have a particularly sterling reputation in the uh ability to act in a very timely manner i i just find it appalling that we're waiting for the fda to approve these but i do appreciate that the testimony has been helpful and with that i don't die madam chair quick explanation i support the bill and vote i but i'd like it noted that this is not intended to validate the legitimacy of this product as being safe for anyone so please note that hi given senate bill 1053 you do pass recommendation members for the first committee hearing we are complete thank you very much congress committee is adjourned
WNbqVPxju3s,AK,3-12-2015,good afternoon it is about um 308 on thursday march 12th and president house uh health and social services is uh vice chair vasquez representative stutz president of tar representative calrico representative wohl myself chair seaton remind everybody about their cell phones and address their comments or questions through the chair on our calendar for today is a

presentation on facing foster care and that'll be about a 15 minute segment and then we will go into our second hearing on hb 40 which is e-cigarettes and we will have a presentation by the bill sponsor a couple of invited guests and then we will have public testimony it is not our intention to move the bill today but we'll uh take public testimony but we will have to quit probably about five minutes early so we'll uh 4 40 or 4 55 or so uh because we are going back on the floor at five o'clock and so that'll give everybody a chance to um make it to the floor uh is there anything did anybody have oh um i did announce earlier today that we were going to have a medicaid expansion and reform working group uh on uh saturday march 21st that'll be four to six pm that'll be in here it won't be a committee meeting it's going to be a working group so we can sit around and um piece things together see if there is a way forward that the company wants to take and so that those that will be what what that is that working group not a regular formalized committee room committee meeting so we have today division of public health and dr butler and joel lewis would you come forward and we

that and that should be receiving public testimony and members i know with the with the budget up today there are some people are coming in and out but one nice thing is we can review this testimony now because it's all recorded and people can catch up at another time if they have to go to other meetings during the day so thanks and for coming would you identify yourself for the record and go ahead with your testimony thank you mr chairman for the record my name is jay butler chief medical officer in the department of health and social services and also director of the division of public health with me is jill lewis on the keyboards jill is deputy director of the division of public health today we'd like to serve a public health buffet of conversations including a quick overview of healthy alaskans 2020 and we'd also like to respond to two topics requested by the committee one on home visits and one on nutrition nutrition is a very big topic in quite a bit of the work that the division and uh we do throughout healthcare is focused on obesity right now but a uh for the purpose of this presentation today i thought it would be more interesting to drill down on two micronutrients folic acid and the ever popular vitamin d so starting with healthy alaskans 2020 i'd like to rewind to the pilot episode of department presentations to this committee when commissioner davidson and i described the department areas of primary focus for the coming year and she outlined the first being access to health care second child welfare third developing tribal and federal partnerships and uh fourth improving the health status of alaskans and i spent some time going through seven areas of opportunity and then finished that by uh saying and implementing the healthy alaskans 2020 plan will be part of the means to that end so i want to provide a little more detail of that today um i feel like after tuesday i need to before you go further i just wanted to recognize that representative foster has joined us we have a full committee um before i go any further after tuesday's hearing i feel like i need to distinguish healthy alaskans 2020 from healthy alaska plan i know the alaska and alaskans can get a little confusing at times but we're all moving in the same direction in terms of healthier people in a healthier state i do feel a little compelled uh with all due respect to my partners in the uh the department that the term healthy alaskans was one that we were using even back in the hickle administration i have a copy here of healthy alaskans 20 2000 uh so it is something that has been around for a while um next slide um healthy alaskans 2020 though is quite distinct from healthy alaskans 2000 and healthy alaskans 2010 in a number of measures uh and i think the first is that this is really a state tribal partnership the effort has been co-organized and co-led by the division of public health and the alaska native tribal health consortium this partnership's a natural since both organizations have statewide public health responsibilities and work with local health care providers throughout the state the mission of the division of public health of course is to protect and promote the health of alaskans the vision of anthc is that alaska native people are the healthiest people in the world this creates a synergy next slide please for achieving the vision of healthy alaskans in healthy communities the work has been driven by a statewide voluntary advisory team composed of some 35 alaskans from a variety of disciplines including behavioral health education early childhood development environmental health criminal justice as well as public health health care health insurance and health policy together these partners have defined a mission for healthy alaskans 2020 to provide a framework and to foster partnerships to optimize health for all alaskans and their communities the advisory team also defined guiding principles for how the effort would go forward including using the best scientific research and data available as well as tapping into local knowledge from our diverse cultures also building strong partnerships with mutual accountability not only to funders but to one another addressing health equity which continues to be a struggle in our state some of us are healthier than others and much of that is driven by socioeconomic status so we recognize that up front another guiding principle was to strengthen communities and empower individuals to be able to take personal responsibility for their health and finally to improve the quality of life across the lifespan not just longer lives but healthier lives the process started in the communities both through online surveys open to all alaskans and with town hall meetings in a number of our communities that were co-led by state and tribal leaders this provided an opportunity to get input and to learn what alaskans feel like are important health issues the advisory team participated in this process and met with data team and other subject matter experts to be able to parse this out and uh ultimately uh work through the more than 70 uh concerns i think that were that were raised and to focus on the areas where there's good data where we believe we can really make a difference the advisory team makes recommendations to the healthy alaskan steering team which is made up of the commissioner the chief medical officer in the department of health and social services as well as the ceo and the senior director for community health at anthc i should add also that an unofficial guiding principle was that we can't do everything i think the another partner effort is the healthy people 2020 which is the national federal effort uh which has i think over 2000 goals and is a book about this thick for the record that's about three inches so we really wanted to be able to focus in on areas where we could make a difference next slide so the advisory team defined 25 health priorities with specific data indicators action plans and targets to meet by the year 2020. there's a scorecard defining sort of where we're at in terms of our baseline in 2010 our goal for 2020 and the most recent data which is oftentimes lags for a year or two or in some cases even three but it gives you a feel for kind of where we're going it highlights where uh we've achieved goals already there's actually six of them that we've met our 2020 goal in areas where we're not moving in the the right direction right now and this this scorecard is in the back of your uh packet i believe um the the six where we've achieved i want to stress though uh it doesn't mean that we can anyway relax health is a part of the biologic systems that we're all representing and oftentimes these are systems with a lot of moving parts and we recognize that if we are not vigilant that we could actually lose ground on some of these measures and i'll just use as an example youth smoking for instance we've made tremendous progress and we don't want to lose that that those gains it's important to note that these indicators don't cover everything we do in the division of public health this really was a statewide process that incorporated partners outside of government and that a number of the measures are really outside of the scope of what we do in dph it makes an exciting group though because we really have worked together to be bureaucratic silo busters and to look at how each of the organizations that are involved and each of the sectors can best play their hand the best to move us all in the same direction i should also point out that uh this doesn't necessarily address new and emerging issues uh for instance during the discussions i don't recall that the possibility of marijuana legalization ever came up so there are things that are very high on our radar screen that you won't see here next slide this graph i recognize is very complicated it's one reason why you have it as a handout also the intention though is to demonstrate how the advisory team has grouped the indicators to address broad topics such as the outcomes of longer and better life and into health factors including healthy behaviors access to clinical hair care social determinants of health which are things like economic health of our communities and the physical environment another difference with healthy alaskans 2020 is we don't have a book what we do have is a website uh our feeling was that oftentimes reports like this can be useful but they oftentimes wind up on shelves and they are not living documents so you can track the progress of healthy alaskans 2020 at ha2020.alaska.gov and you can find updates on the performance data as well as description of evidence-based strategies to achieve the targets as well as list of actions undertaken who are the key partners as well as state and national resources next slide please the partners involved in this have already described how they've used this effort to help guide their strategic planning and to develop performance improvement plans that can guide what they do best the ongoing process will also generate accessible data to quantify the problems and progress healthy alaskans has provided a focal port for understanding community priorities for selecting strategies to improve health and to and for leading efforts among the partners including the alaska wellness coalition the uaa behavioral health alliance recover alaska the all alaska pediatric partnership and the juno suicide prevention coalition as well as the work we do in the department of health and social services as well as anthc which just having come from there i can say that was part of our annual evaluations for a number of our leaders so to summarize the the work to date healthy alaskans 2020 has identified health priorities set targets and selected strategies to achieve those targets it's uh actually a whole lot of work that i feel uh i'm underrepresenting in only about 10 minutes particularly the work that many of the partners did over this time the current focus is to make identify lead partners so that we can be sure that all of our efforts are aligned and that we continue to work together i'd be happy i think i'd be best to stop at this time and take any questions you you have uh on the process and we have some providers from the division waiting to speak on the the other topics but both jill's been very intricately involved in healthy alaskans 2020 with the advisory council so either one of us would be happy to take any questions you have great questions uh let's start on slide four which was had health equity there can you define how you are dealing with the guiding principle of health equity and how that drives the process um yes uh mr chairman and uh i'll defer to jill if she has anything to add but i'll uh start by saying part of the process that went into uh identifying the 25 priorities we're looking at areas where some parts of the population have better health than others and in particularly particularly we focused on inequities uh between alaska native people and uh other alaskans so that's why uh particular for example you'll see uh suicide was an issue that we didn't uh back down uh from a very difficult problem and one that our tribal leaders are struggling with and making some progress with so it it's better health status is that what we're talking about in equity or is it better or is it access to um health care or health facilities i'm just trying to figure out equity sometimes gets to be an amorphous term for us to figure out how it drives the process right well if i could use an example uh mr chairman of a health measure of life expectancy for instance the life expectancy for alaska native people is about five years shorter uh than for other alaskans so that would be an example of a health inequity you know in terms of access to care um that would could be an example of a health inequity i think uh if we're talking about uh native people non-native people uh that may be less of an issue but uh we're looking at areas where some of us enjoy better health than others and so would that be sub-populations such as pacific islanders in anchorage as a subpopulation if they were exhibiting less healthy outcomes then we would concentrate on figuring out what those uh what could be contributing to that and address that yes mr chairman uh although i would add that we would be doing that in partnership with those communities not uh that's that's one thing that i want to really emphasize in the whole effort is uh it's been a process where we've really tried to get input from the community so that it's an effort that's not being done to people but is being done by people and often probably identifying the data is to know to demonstrate that you do have health ed equities i guess that would be a big part of this as well wouldn't it yes mr chairman thank you um on slide seven can you explain a little more like we have length of life up there and then we have 1 7 14 16 and how those uh relate or each of the numbers to where we are whether it's um but alcohol and drug use is 15 and and but it doesn't have 14 alcohol induced deaths or any of the things on child abuse or any of those aren't included in that i'm i'm trying to figure out how how that works sure for the record my name is jill lewis i'm deputy director for the division of public health and i will try and address your questions mr chairman the numbers do correlate to the 25 leading health indicators and in some cases those indicators are very directly related to a particular health behavior or social and economic factor like for example tobacco use number two and three are very specific uh for increasing the percentage of high school students who have not smoked and increasing the percentage of adults who currently do not smoke so just showing that alignment in some cases it's very specific and so those are shown mostly in the lower portion of this grid and at the top the ones that you see up there are ones that are more general across categories of health factors and really focus on their overall health outcome for example number one is the rate of cancer deaths in the state and that has every uh is directly related to the length of life rather than a specific one of the other health factors or policies and programs and and can you explain to us how this would be used i mean are we looking at i mean on the far left is health outcomes health factors and um policies in this program and then those lead into those other two and i'm just trying to figure out how the flow chart works or are we looking at the left-hand side and then trying to figure out okay what are health outcomes length of life and quality of life and then that those those eight specific ones that are targeted to that so how would you use this in the collaboration i mean would you look at quality of life and then you would be identifying those four things as target um to address well mr chairman the portion on the left with the arrows pointing up indicate that you know it in order to address the full spectrum of health to get the best possible outcomes you have the policies and programs first that influence the health factors those health factors influence your health outcomes so that it's building and the health factors are the portion in the middle that are listed out in groups the four main groups being the behaviors the clinical care the social and economic factors the physical environment and if you don't address all of that you aren't going to be able to reach those health outcomes if you if for example we had no leading health indicators that dealt with social and economic factors then that would be a definite gap the purpose is of showing it to you in this grid is really sort of to illustrate the full array in the full spectrum that these indicators cover that they aren't just about one thing like tobacco use or income or access to care that it's it does cover the full spectrum and that's what's necessary in order to really achieve the goals okay so so you're using this as the identifier for what action you should take to work to the to the left whether it's alcohol or drug use or diet and exercise so you'd go for diet and exercise and you'd look at number six and that would be physical activity adults and youth and then just trying to figure out if this is a mechanism by which you're trying to drive action or this just an explanation of the way you look at the at the 25 health priorities uh mr chairman i think it's actually more of a way just to look at the 25 health indicators across the spectrum rather than a way that we would actually approach or organize aligning the efforts okay thank you uh anyone else have any questions on the first portion representative tarr thank you mr chairman dr butler we you um were at the presentation for the healthcare commission and in that presentation there were a series of policy recommendations and you know sort of the the what had been generated from the work done by that group and so i'm just wondering from this work and then the work done by that group is there some integration um of those efforts so we're you know sort of um yeah just kind of bringing bringing those efforts together i guess that's what i'm wondering yes um representative tarr through the chair thank you for that uh question um yes in fact we even had had it in the slide although uh in respect for the time frame i i skipped over it fairly quickly but there was uh representation from the health care commission in the process and uh while i didn't mention it during the the lunch and learn uh if you go through the annual reports from the healthcare commission there's a number of times that there are references to healthy alaskans 2020 particularly as it relates to some of the the goals of the healthcare commission for prevention okay thank you okay thank you go ahead your presentation and i think that we don't have other questions at this point okay thank you so mr chairman i'd like to uh introduce rebecca morrissey who is in our section of women's children's and family health in the division of public health who can give us an overview of home visiting in alaska becky are you there and if she's not i'm not nearly as good as okay very good i'm here now okay uh please proceed and uh let us know when you need the slides to forward thank you and uh rebecca would you please identify yourself for the record and go ahead through the chair again my name is rebecca morrissey i'm the unit manager for our perineum early childhood health unit and i coordinate the maternal hemp and early childhood home visiting program for our state so today i'm going to talk a little bit about home visiting in alaska and so this will be the first slide police with an emphasis on evidence-based tone visiting programs so why is home visiting important for families and why is it an important part of public health well there's established evidence that home visits by a nurse social worker or other early child and educator can improve child and family outcomes we know that the early childhood time period is also a critical time for brain development and a child's home is a critical part of the learning environment we also know that parents do need support and they often say that kids don't come with instruction manuals we use the term home visiting law but that really just describes the where what we're really talking about is a voluntary program to provide family support in parent education next slide please so there are 17 models of home visiting that have been designated nationally as evidence-based through demonstration and randomized control trials i've included some of those on the slide and the first three that i have listed here that are bolded are the evidence-based home visiting models found in alaska please note there are differences between home visiting models and programs they can vary on the type of professional providing services the intensity and frequency of visits and also programs have different goals objectives the types of services that are delivered during a visit and also programs may have different eligibility for participants next slide please so today i'm going to talk about what our division of public health is doing with home visiting highlighting these three programs i have listed here our maternal infant early childhood home visiting program healthy start and lastly public health nursing but i'd also like to mention that there are other pro home visiting programs going on in alaska that aren't are not administered to our division there's home visiting services occurring in different capacities at the office of children's services the infant learning program the military tribal health and many other non-profit agencies next lastly so the maternal infant and early child and home visiting program we commonly refer to it as mcv is administered through our section of women's children's and family health we have one local implementing agency which is providence in-home services and that's located in anchorage we've been talking more about home visiting in the past couple of years that home visiting has been going on in alaska for a long time in various capacities nationally there's been an increased emphasis in recent years to implement evidence-based home visiting services to at-risk families and communities in 2010 our section was a recipient of federal funding to implement an evidence-based model in an at-risk community in our state and the emphasis on programs to be evidence-based has been an important change to the field and the profession of this work after a statewide needs assessment was completed nurse family partnership was selected as the evidence-based evidence-based model for the alaska program next slide steve so these what i have listed here are the overarching goals of the mcv program and they are to improve health outcomes improve socioeconomic status school readiness decrease intimate partner violence in child maltreatment and also improve parenting skills states are required to report on a benchmark plan that has performance measures related to the six goals i have listed here for example we're looking at such measures as tobacco use prenatal care employment breastfeeding educational attainment among many others next slide please as i mentioned before nurse family partnership was a model selected for our program and it was selected as it best targeted the outcomes that public health wanted to improve in alaska it's an evidence-based model and that is ground in over 37 years of randomized controlled trials and these studies involved comparing the maternal child health and child developmental outcomes with groups of similar mothers who did not participate in the nurse family partnership program next slide please these are some of the outcomes that were identified in those randomized controlled trials and you can see that there were improvements in such things as pre-term delivery child abuse neglect school readiness maternal employment status and also decreases in criminal activity next slide please so being an evidence-based program there's certain criteria and guidelines that are available this program is administered by registered nurses in the home and your family nurse home visitors are utilized in this model as they are perceived as trusting and competent professionals nurses have a set of visit to visit guidelines or a curriculum you could say that guide the content of the visits throughout the program however the model does allow the client to office guide visit content and allows the nurse to use judgment when picking visit priorities or topics for that day women in this program must be enrolled by the 28th week of pregnancy and be a first-time mom this allows for early education on having a healthy pregnancy in the nsp program at providence clients must also be low income and that's defined by medicator with eligibility so visits begin prenatally and end when the child reaches age two next class so the nurse family partnership model includes all the health promotion content and readings that are listed here in addition to many others in regards to nutrition the nurses cover with clients such things as what foods to avoid during pregnancy portion sizes types of healthy foods needed in pregnancy eating healthy on a tight budget and taking multivitamins with folic acid including the recommendation to take 0.4 to 0.8 milligrams of folic acid daily an important part of this program is the relationship that occurs between the nurse and the client the nurse serves as a model for healthy behaviors and beliefs in that client's success nurse home visitors also take a positive approach with clients to build on that clients strengths so along with the important health education promotion screenings provided by the home visitor there's also discussion on life planning and that includes such things as plans for work and also plans for further education there's specific and measurable outcomes that are intended to change the life course trajectory for the woman and her family next slide please so what makes this program evidence-based well critical piece of implementing an evidence-based program is to maintain fidelity to the model meaning that you're implementing the model in the way it was designed for replication we know that model fidelity is important to achieving the desired program outcomes following these elements allows you to best achieve the desired outcomes that were demonstrated in the original trials and our alaska program monterey fidelity ml is an important part of our continuous quality improvement activities running data reports on these elements on a monthly basis allows both public health and the nurse home visitors to understand where things are going well and where there may be opportunities for improvement and lastly the content of the visits is consistent and based on prevention science next slide please so because of the randomized control trials and the extensive research on the replication of this program nurse family partnership has been able to demonstrate a return on investment the rand corporation knows that for every dollar community invests in nfp they can see up to 5.70 in return the trials noted increases in family education and employment status along with savings related to governmental costs such as medicaid and food stamps next slide please so as i mentioned previously alaska has a benchmark plan for evaluating if the program is meeting its purposes and goals we have some preliminary outcomes on the mothers and children that have been seen in the first 21 months of the program and in this small time frame there's been demonstrated improvement in breastfeeding prenatal care which is a healthy alaskans 2020 priority tobacco use and some others you see here so by september 30th of last year there were 100 women enrolled in the program and that is the capacity of the program of the seven mothers in the program whose child had reached one year of age by that time five of the seven had improved their employment status and all seven had improved their educational attainment level since enrollment our numbers and results still are are small and in a rather short time frame whereas nurse family partnership has been following their families over the course of many years next slide please i also wanted to highlight another program within our division and that's healthy start healthy start is a case management program and it's operated out of the norton sound health corporation serving gnome and surrounding 15 villages it's not a home visiting program per se but rather a case management program that includes home visits as a component it also serves families from pregnancy until the child is age two the main goal of healthy start is to decrease infant mortality and there's also a strong community focused on this program along with a strong emphasis on linking clients with behavioral health services next likely and lastly public health nursing it should be mentioned that while public health nursing doesn't have a formal home visiting program for stay or use an evidence-based model they do provide home visiting services in our state using evidence-based practice guidelines these visits are done on a case-by-case episode of basis depending on the community and the number of resources that are available and the target is really those families that are high risk which i have listed here so public health nurses monitor body mass index by measuring height and weight and provide counseling on having a healthy lifestyle and they also try to provide important screenings related to immunizations alcohol and domestic violence next slices so the the goal really is not to provide cases long-term case management services in public health nursing but rather for the nurse to link these at-risk families with needed referrals and facilitate that initiation of case management and these services are not intended to duplicate any other home visiting services or models that may be provided in that community but really act as a safety net for those at-risk families thank uh you you and i guess um the providence in home so there's one program in the state and that's that served about a hundred um pregnant women is that correct through the chart yes that is correct um there are 100 families um at the end of february there were 105 families enrolled in the program each nurse has a caseload of 25 families with a supervisor who carries a small case-loaded client okay i guess are is there a plan to with approximately 11 000 births and probably half of those are singleton um first term bursts uh is there a i mean a hundred is a very small number compared to that um and also only being located in in anchorage is this a pilot project to determine whether there's useful success in at the cost or exactly trying to figure out what i know that public health nurses aren't available for out of home visits almost exclusively at least on the kenai peninsula so this is non-public health nurses in a private setting and how is that funded again sure so the funding comes from the federal government through the health resources services administration and our state received the minimum amount of formula funding so that is why we have one program in one community we did apply for competitive expansion funding that was a bit made available to expand the current program and that is going to allow the addition of four more nurse home visitors both in anchorage and also in the math subaru now but you're correct that 100 families um that is there's more of a need for it outside of 100 families there's certainly more at-risk low-income first-time moms in our state thank you and can you go back to slide 8 for a minute that was on the outcomes identified and so 79 reduction in pre-term deliveries and others who smoked do we have a enough of a sample to find out what the pre-term uh delivery rate is i know that in the last year it went up from 9.6 or so up to 10.3 so seems like overall in the state we're going in the wrong direction so did you have a is there any comparison here or is this just looking at a very few moms who did smoke and i'm trying to figure out how significant this measurement is for us to be able to say very much about the population in the state so the outcomes that are listed on this slide are the outcomes that were identified in nurse family partnership three randomized controlled trials so this is not alaska data that's what they found in the original trial now pre-term delivery is not one of the benchmark plans one of the indicators that we are reporting on but it is something that we monitor in the program i don't have a specific percentage um there have been a couple preterm bursts but again we're dealing with small numbers i don't know the percentage right now but i could follow up with that and get that to you okay thank you and maybe you can send us a link to that those outcomes from the um the randomized control trials so we can look and see where those are and where alaska compares so that we know what we're going with i mean last year we were proposing a 500 birth trial you know protect our children now it was using vitamin d and all and they had taken the preterm birth down to seven percent with just that initiative that was going on and now that's being funded by in south carolina by the um what is it select health the insurance company is is providing the because they were saving so much more by eliminating um taking that from ten and a half down to seven percent pre-term burst would save us a lot of money and a lot of consequences so anyway i appreciate that if you had forward that on back to us uh does anyone else have any other questions on this presentation and i guess the only other thing that i would have is you know we're talking about folic acid um usage and i'm wondering what our neural tube defect rate is now i know that a few years ago we established i think we got it through legislation that um pre prenatal vitamins would have to have a certain amount of folic acid in them and we were trying to get that utilized in all the communities but maybe you can just follow up with us later dr butler um on that because since it's one of the measures that we're talking about right and mr chairman uh i believe that uh the following presentation will specifically address that great thank you um don't see any other questions so thank you very much uh rebecca for your presentation today and um we'll go ahead and proceed okay right um the next presentation is by uh stephanie reitzman birch uh stephanie are you there good afternoon mr chair can you hear me okay it sounds like it we sure can and would you go ahead and identify yourself for the record who you uh represent and also would you um go ahead and say where you are based out of just so we as a committee know where the uh people are based out of thanks yes thank you mr chair so i'm stephanie wrightsville burch i'm the section chief for women children and family health in the division of public health and thank you so much for the invitation i'm here to share with you um and discuss the scientific evidence that supports the national recommendations for folic acid supplementation and what the steps were that led to this national recommendation for all women ages 15 to 44. so first just to make sure we sort of understand what folic acid is it it's actually a vitamin b that's commonly found in foods it's also known as folate which is actually its synthetic form folic acid as a synthetic form is used in vitamin supplements and is added to fortified foods such as breads pasta and cereal in its natural form folic acid is found in small amounts in spinach broccoli asparagus and citrus fruits it's an important dietary component that research has demonstrated will prevent neural tube defects and neural tube defects are the incomplete development of the brain the spinal cord or its coverings that occur occur early in pregnancy we've the research has shown it's very difficult to get an adequate amount of folic acid from diet alone which is why pregnant women and women who may become pregnant should are it's recommended that they take a supplement of folic acid and you can see that the american college of obstetrics and gynecologists in 2013 and years prior to that has made that recommendation so a little bit of information about neural tube defects i'm sorry i'm on slide three for my uh slide mover thank you jill the two most common types of neural tube defects are spina bifida and anencephaly spina bifida occurs when an unborn baby's spinal column does not close to protect the spinal cord and as a result the nerves that control leg movements and other functions do not work properly children with spina bifida often have lifelong disabilities and may need many surgeries as well as adaptive equipment in order to maintain their mobility and independent functioning throughout their life anencephaly occurs when most or all of the brain does not develop and babies with this problem die before or shortly after birth the center for disease control and prevention notes that about 3 000 pregnancies each year are affected by spina bifida or anencephaly according to the centers for disease control it's estimated that 50 to 70 percent of neural tube defects could be prevented by taking a minimum of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid daily the challenge of course is that because nearly half of all pregnancies are not planned according to the data offered by cdc and we have found that also to be the case in our state the center for disease control the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of obstetrics and gynecologists recommend that all women of childbearing age starting ages 15 through 44 should take a multivitamin with a minimum of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid you'll notice that that's also the recommendation of the march of dimes next slide please so how how do we get to uh where we are right now with recommendations this started back in 1992 where earlier recommendations were based on some of the first research done in folic acid and led by the u.s public public health service where women it was recommended that women of child bearing age consume the 0.4 milligram dose in 1996 the u.s preventative services task force which is made up of 16 volunteer members who are nationally recognized experts in evidence-based medicine and prevention also reviewed their studies and recommended that 0.4 milligrams should be taken by women of childbearing age on a daily basis and this was based upon several studies one noteworthy study was a very large randomized control trial which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in neural tube defects in women who took a multivitamin with 0.8 milligrams of folic acid as a result of their analysis of the study and several others they came out with a recommendation that's listed as an a recommendation i'll explain later what that means of course recognizing that not all childbearing women in particular were taking folic acid supplementation or getting adequate amounts of the natural curly occurring folate in their diet the u.s food and drug administration then also mandated that folic acid be added to enrich green products starting in 1998 and then following that recommendation the food and nutrition board of the national academy of sciences at the institute of medicine recommended that to reduce the risk for neural tube defects in effective pregnancies women who are capable of becoming pregnant should also take the supplement of 0.4 milligrams next slide please so just a little bit about the u.s preventative task force review evidence review so they conducted in 2009 a very systematic review and based upon the evidence of benefits and harms and an assessment of the net benefit of the service by reviewing several studies this level of meta-analysis has an important role in guiding clinical and public health practice and the education of the public at large one study in particular that they reviewed was a randomized control trial in hungary which reported on the protective effects of multivitamins containing folic acid against first occurrences of neural tube defects the study demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences between women who received the supplementation and those who did not they also reviewed two large case control studies one of which was done in california and one in south carolina looking at the association of supplementation and the outcome of neural tube defects both of these studies were very large study and control populations and finally as the meta-analysis meaning they looked at multiple studies in this review all of which demonstrated multivitamins with folic acid were protective for neural tube defects i think the important part of the piece that i want to emphasize on this review of the literature is that in these studies all of the data was non-conflicting and so what that means is that in each of the studies they demonstrated the same consistent results next slide please so this comprehensive review is really what uh the us preventative task force is known for and as a result of that they led to updating the recommendations um that any all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a supplement containing a minimum of 0.4 milligrams to 0.8 milligrams as i mentioned this was given a grade a recommendation which means that there's a high level of certainty that the net benefit is substantial having this high level of certainty means the evidence is consistent and comes from multiple well-designed studies where the data does not conflict thus it is unlikely the conclusions would be any different in future studies there is a review of the research again currently happening and according to their web website they plan to report an updated they will communicate their funding findings and report on an updated recommendation sometime in 2016. i think those of us in the provider community are anticipating that they may suggest an increase in the minimum level of folic acid so next slide please so how did this then affect public health practice well then back in 1999 when the early recommendations and evidence on folic acid were published um a folic acid campaign was established between the centers for disease control march of dimes and the national council on folic acid there were surveys that were done by cdc and march of dimes to demonstrate where we were at and as baseline data it was indicated that many women were not aware of folic acid or the or the possibility of neural tube defects and so this was really a public health opportunity to educate women just to give kind of give you an example of where we started from the march of dimes conducted its first survey in 1990 found in 1995 to establish a benchmark of knowledge and behaviors of women and childbearing age relative to daily consumption surveys were done for the next six years to measure progress so in 1995 to 2001 here are some of the changes that occurred as a result of the national campaign awareness of folic acid did increase from 52 in 1995 to 79 in 2001. and the knowledge of the recommendations about supplementation more than doubled from a low of 15 percent to 32 percent what was surprising i think to all of us is that this did not translate however into a significant change in behavior in the proportion of women surveyed who stated that they were taking a multivitamin in fact there was an initial decrease from a high of 34 percent of the study population to a decrease in 29 percent in 2001. with the added efforts at the state in addition to the national campaign the percent did increase over time however and in 2008 which is when the last survey was conducted about 40 percent of the women surveyed reported taking folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid despite a reported awareness of eighty four percent of the women so i think this shows that despite public health education the encouragement of health care providers to do something the recommendations sometimes do not fully lead always fully lead to action on the part of women and their behaviors in terms of taking bullet acid supplementation and therefore there's really an importance that supports the addition of folic acid to breads and pasta and cereal so what happened in alaska so we also started in 2009 we were very fortunate to receive a small 10 000 grant from the march of dimes we built a coalition that included my colleagues here in the section of women's children's family health the birth defects registry march of dimes the public health nurses municipality of anchorage the tribal tribal entities south central foundation and the women infant and children nutrition program next slide please our folic acid coalition here in alaska really maximized the use of fundings and blended and braided opportunities and it funded development of posters and pamphlets we did a small survey in alaska of alaska women to measure their knowledge and awareness and we were able to develop materials that were going to be speak to the women here in alaska particularly to our tribal health partners and and the women who are in our rural parts of the state we did public service announcements magazine ads new spots and we sponsored a speaker march of dimes generously sponsored a speaker to speak at one of the annual summer updates for ob gyn held here in anchorage so how has that worked how how well have we done so nationally since supplementation recommendations on folic acid were introduced the prevalence of spina bifida declined 31 between 1995 and 96 in 1998 and 2006 in the u.s this translated to a decrease and here's where it gets a little technical so bear with me decrease of five babies per ten thousand life births down to three point four nine babies per uh it i'm sorry three point four nine nine uh babies with neural chief defects per ten thousand live births in the us next slide please in alaska to answer your question mr chairman the prevalence of neural tube defects has also decreased and this data that i'm going to share with you as well as some updated data that's not shown on this slide is from our alaska birth defects registry we actually have a statute that requires hospitals and physician offices to report on birth defects there's a long list of them and it's a passive surveillance system of reporting but you can see that it's very very important for us to help guide our practice and focus our educational efforts there was a decrease you can see in the years between 2000 and 2002. from 9.7 to 5.7 and that translates to about 54 in total infants were born with neural tube defects the updated data that i have to share with you today is that between 2003 through today so that's about 11 and a half years there have been a total of about 90 confirmed reports of neural tube defects in alaska so that means on an average for each of those 11 half years there are about seven children born per year with some type of neural tube defect in alaska interestingly more than slightly more than 50 percent of these children were born with spina bifida specifically the good news though is that since 2008 our numbers of neural tube defects each year has decreased and we've been at an average of around three and a half to four children per year next slide please so our current status where are we so this is really a standard practice in prenatal care our recommendation is that multivitamins any multivitamin that is distributed for prenatal or for all women of child bearing age should include a minimum of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid public health continuously monitors these reports of neural tube defects and we go out and verify as needed we also have data from a survey that women answer after they become pregnant it's called the pregnancy risk associated monitoring systems where we really gain a tremendous amount of knowledge about preg pregnant women's women who have been pregnant their knowledge of folic acid the importance of birth defects prevention and their intake of folic acid supplementation and that's really helped us to determine new and novel ways to get this information out to women of childbearing years monitoring the data allows public health to determine program priorities and monitor for new evidence-based interventions and also assure that rates continue to decrease over time as i mentioned there are studies going on which are looking at the protectiveness of folic acid intake and the prevention of other congenital anomalies such as congenital heart and cleft lip and palate birth defects and i'm assuming that the us prevention task force will be re-examining the scientific evidence to determine if the recommendation should change and as i mentioned that they plan to be published in 2016. thank you mr chair and i'm available to take any questions thank you i i thought earlier you said the national recommendation was point 0.8 and had been increased to that by the task force and that was where they had and we're still at 0.4 no the recommendation is um excuse me uh mr chair the recommendation is 0.42 0.8 that is the u.s preventative task force recommendation so a minimum of 0.4 milligrams okay and the 3.4 per year average are we looking at that as the 0.4 was ineffective or is that a compliance issue that most of those did not get 0.4 per day do do we have follow-up information on that to know whether we're talking about compliance or effectiveness mr chair the um no we don't have information if you uh remember back on page slide three the data that was shared by the center for disease control did mention that probably only 50 to 70 percent of neural tube defects could be prevented from taking 0.4 milligrams of folic acid daily so one could conclude that perhaps even if we're we're finding that three to four babies a year in alaska are born with neural tube defects it could be random genetic issues it could be compliance it could be availability of of nutritional supplements medicaid i will tell you medicaid covers the cost of prenatal vitamins for women who become pregnant in our state and my review of the vitamins when i've gone to costco to look at the many different types of vitamins that are on the shelf available just over the counter has indicated to me that most vitamins multivitamins on a daily basis have the minimum amounts of 0.4 milligrams already in them okay thank you and i think it would be very worthwhile to be following up on those reported that passive report and finding out whether there was compliance with that or not whether they were taking the multivitamin or whether we you know i mean because if if we don't know why we are getting that rate we are unable to make a change so um i i would hope that that's one of the questions on the report is whether when a neural tube defect is reported by the doctors they're also having asking a question you know were prenatal vitamins taken regularly during the pregnancy so thank you very much for the report here and don't see any questions mr chairman uh moving from folic acid to vitamin d as we discussed earlier vitamin d is a evolving and very uh exciting area there are parts of the vitamin d story that i think like folic acid there's not any dispute the data are not emerging we know quite a bit and that relates then not only to individual choice about taking supplements or what individual practitioners might do but also how we do public health practice so we are going to focus in this presentation on skeletal health and i'm sure we can discuss other issues as as well as we frequently do and i just want to acknowledge that i enjoyed that that conversation and that opportunity to learn um so with us is uh dr ross singleton uh a staff physician recently joined the division of public health uh a long career in the tribal health system and i believe that she also has a pediatric endocrinologist uh clinician uh with her as well uh so i'll turn it over to dr singleton and i'll let her identify herself as well as anybody else that she may have with her great thank you rosalind are you on yes i sure am hello mr chairman my name is rosalyn singleton i'm a staff physician with section of epidemiology but i've worked with the alaska native tribal health consortium for three decades nearly and today i will discuss two alaskan studies evaluating rickets and vitamin d deficiency in alaskan native children and with me today since i am not an expert on vitamin d i've invited dr rachel lescher who is a pediatric endocrinologist to be available to answer questions which i don't feel comfortable with so thank you rachel for joining us second slide today i'm going to the objective of the first study that i'll discuss was to understand causes of rickets and preventive measures in alaska native children the second study was an exploration of the relationship between traditional marine diet and maternal vitamin d levels and finally i'll discuss current educational and outreach efforts slide number three vitamin d deficiency is a nutritional deficiency with increasing prevalence since the 1990s after being rather rare finding for a couple centuries and risk factors are insufficient intake or sun exposure sun exposure obviously is a particular issue in alaska and significant exclusive breastfeeding is another significant risk factor ricketts is a state of extreme vitamin d deficiency in growing bone and occurs in infants and young children with a peak incidence between three and 18 months of age um it presents with wrist and rib swelling with leg bowing and sometimes with seizures from low calcium levels next slide vitamin d deficiency is defined by the american academy of pediatrics or the aap and also by the institute of medicine the pediatric endocrine society and the european society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition and the endocrine society as a level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d below 20 nanograms per ml and this is associated with a level of higher risk for skeletal effects in addition the endocrine society also defines vitamin d insufficiency as 21 to 29 nanograms per ml a level at which individuals may be at increased risk for extra-skeletal effects which are not as clearly understood next slide all of these groups state that evidence is insufficient to recommend universal screening for vitamin d deficiency specifically the american academy of pediatric advisors screening for vitamin d deficiency only in children and adolescents with conditions associated with reduced bone mass and or recurrent fractures for instance malabsorption and liver disease the endocrine society also recommends screenings of at-risk individuals including children's obesity on black and hispanic um children but this is somewhat controversial and according to the ap it would involve screening testing and retesting large numbers of children without evidence without evidence of clear cost benefit in reducing fractures well what about food um since we don't have much sunlight salmon and other oily fish have some of the highest vitamin d contents of any food and i'll point you to sockeye salmon canned sockeye salmon has over 700 international units of vitamin d in the past we'll show that alaska native people with a high marine subsistence diet had high intake of vitamin d and also high levels of vitamin d well what about supplementation recommendations the american academy of pediatrics recommends that any breastfed or partially breastfed infant be supplemented with 400 international units of vitamin d non-breastfed infants who take less than one liter of per day of vitamin d fortified formula or milk should be supplemented with 400 international units also the amount of vitamin d in one liter of infant formula is around 400 international units and then older children and adolescents are recommended to have supplementation with 600 international units of vitamin d if dietary intake is inadequate so on to our studies this in my first 15 years of pediatric practice i didn't see a case of rickets however in 1996 i diagnosed a healthy breastfeeding infant with rickets and that got my attention in 2010 i was approached by a alaska native medical center physician who was concerned about the number of rickets he was cases of rickets he was seeing in northern communities a group of tribal and cdc physicians and epidemiologists donated their time to study this issue and we evaluated the incidence of ricketts hospitalizations and outpatient visits and we also did a case control study comparing children with vitamin d deficiency and confirmed rickets with age and region mats children to look at factors associated with rickets well one of the first and interesting findings that we found was even in our population among the 16 confirmed cases of rickets the incidents actually increased by latitude even in that small cohort and you can see how there was a significant increase from the lower latitude in alaska to barrow being the highest the overall study results showed that rickett's inpatient and outpatient visit rates were higher in alaska native children than in the general u.s population and in other indian health service sites based on large database studies we found that in addition to increased latitude ricketts diagnosis was in was increased when there was a diagnosis of malnutrition rickets and vitamin d deficiency occurred interestingly in both breast fed and formula fed infants but rickets and vitamin d deficient seed were more common in infants who did not receive vitamin d supplementation and this confirmed the importance of the american academy of pediatric pediatrics recommendation for vitamin d supplementation so we were interested in the potential connection between apparent increases in rickets and the known decline in marine subsistence diet among alaskan native people and whereas before the 1960s a significant proportion of energy was derived from the marine subsistence diet in more recent food intake surveys only about six percent of energy came from marine subsistence foods in younger people in an inner interim study that was about in the 1990s early 2000s about 21 of energy came from native foods and 82 of the vitamin d came from those subsistence foods so to do this we collaborated with the yukon custom health corporation and investigators from the center for alaska native health research um university of fairbanks and university of washington to explore how the intake of traditional foods and serum vitamin d levels have changed in childbearing women and we tested de-identified samples from the alaska area specimen bank in childbearing age women 20 to 29 years of age at points from the 1960s to the 1990s for biomarkers of a traditional marine diet called a delta 15n and the 25 hydroxy vitamin d levels so let's talk a little bit more about this delta 15n well turns out dr diane o'brien has shown that fish and marine mammals are naturally enriched in the heavy stable isotope of nitrogen and as fish and marine mammal intake increases so does the isotope ratio in blood and hair and they're very consistent a person with no marine diet intake would be expected to have a delta 15 n of about eight per ml and each increase of one per ml which is a unit of relative enrichment corresponds with an increase in traditional food intake of about seven percent of the total energy so let's look at the results we found a significant decline in both vitamin d levels from sufficient levels with a mean over 40 nanograms per ml in the 1960s on the left in the orange to the mid-20s in the 1990s to put it in further context in the 1960s a hundred percent of the women tested had vitamin d levels greater than 20 nanograms per ml and half had levels greater than 50 nanograms per ml in contrast by the 1990s only 72 percent had levels greater than 20 nanograms per ml and 0 had levels greater than 50 nanograms per ml similarly the delta 15n in red decreased from a mean of 13 which is similar to levels found in elders to just over 10 which is relatively low marine diet intake in the next slide in this scattergram it turns out the vitamin d levels and delta 15n levels were very highly correlated with a p-value of less than .001 in summary on the next slide we found that vitamin d levels correlated very highly with intake of traditional marine foods and both declined significantly between the 1960s and the 1990s this correlates with food intake surveys marine intake by childbearing age by childbearing women was very high in the 1960s it was similar to what's in current you pick elders but it's dropped to low levels importantly this decreased marine intake was associated with low vitamin d levels in childbearing age women and in pregnant women this could put their infants at risk for rickets early in life and it could help to explain the apparent increase that we've seen in rickets in this population starting in the 1990s so what has the division of public health done to disseminate these findings in 2014 we did a state epi bulletin on ricketts and vitamin d deficiency in children we highlighted the infant vitamin d supplementation guidelines and we followed that up with grand rounds presentations in both anchorage and bethel last week we had a publication of a peer-reviewed journal article showing the results of the first study in the journal of pediatric endocrine and metabolism dr rachel lescher presented at the alaska native research conference and next week she'll be presenting at the international meeting on indigenous child health so what else are we doing to outreach to communities we've contacted public relations um officials and at anthc and at ykhc and other tribal organizations who are helping us start to design and get out the message of the nutritional benefit of salmon and other traditional foods and the importance of recommended vitamin d supplementation for infants and for pregnant women who have inadequate diets and nthc's store outside your door is working on engaging communities to increase subsistence diet and in a couple weeks i'll be presenting in bethel at the tribal gathering to the elders in the yk delta and thank you very much i would love to answer any questions well thank you very much um really appreciate the that and would you mind sending us a link or sending us the articles both the initial study as well as the uh pediatric and endocrine metabolism article appreciate that one thing as you go forward i know we're looking at uh traditional diets and i think that that's uh very um you know appropriate however one thing that we've run into is even your slides here show a modern traditional diet which is the salmon is hung under plywood or under tarps and what is uh being lost is the traditional food preparation technique of sun drying and when you sun dry sun exposure to uvb to oil is the way you create vitamin d for vitamin d supplements so ultraviolet b is very important and that's when you're drying salmon but if you're not drying them out in the sunshine like the elders used to do or if you're refrigerating them putting them in a freezer and they don't get any sun exposure there could be a tremendous difference in the amount of vitamin d in those in those strips just because of the food preservation technique that was used for 10 000 years um so i hope that as we go forward we'll look at that because whether it's reindeer or whether it's you know in russia or whether it's caribou or meats which have oils in them if they're sun-dried for the preservation technique which was the traditional preservation technique it tremendously increases the vitamin d level that's in the food and so i i think we don't want to forget not only what the food is but how the food is prepared and kept we are now going to sorry we've run out of time here we'll want to get back to everyone on these topics again in the future but we have the kids facing foster care um facing foster care um and if and if amanda would come forward and unfortunately i have another meeting so i'm turning the devil over to vice chair vasquez and we will be about 10 minutes and then we'll have to get on to hb40 and obviously we're probably not going to have time to finish that testimony and so we'll leave the testimony on hb40 open as well and appreciate you taking over thank you and sorry i can't be here i'll catch up on the video on the presentation all right thanks welcome you ready yes um for the record my name is amanda mctvier and i'm the executive director of facing foster care in alaska we're a statewide non-profit of young people in and from the foster care system i spent three years in our foster care system myself i aged out of the system i went on to be a foster parent and i have two degrees in social work from uaa i'm also actually a constituent of representative vasquez um so i'll be brief i wanted to talk today about um house bill 27 related to foster care and i had spoke with uh representative seaton before this and he gave me permission to do this it's gonna kind of reflect weird on the record but we have an event happening right now so we have about 22 foster youth right now from around the state that are here in juneau and they're meeting with various offices to talk about some of the things that are important to them some of the things that concern them um because really the ones we're the ones who who live and breathe the system every single day and so we believe that we're the experts and so all of our youth are in the back of the room so if our youth could just stand if you've been in foster care if you could remain standing if you have been in foster care for more than two years remain standing if you've been in foster care for more than four more than six years eight years 10 years 12 years 15 years 16 years 17 18 19. stand up if you've had more than one foster care placement remain standing if you've had more than 2 5 10 15 20 22 24 26 30 32 35 40. 45 50 55 60. stand up if um while you were moving between foster care placements you move schools stay standing if you move schools more than twice more than four six eight ten fifteen stand up if you were placed separately from your siblings have a seat stand up if you've experienced homelessness while in foster care have a seat stand up if you ever felt that you've been judged because of your status in foster care have a seat so i um really appreciate you giving us the opportunity to come today i know we only have a few minutes um and i know i listened to the um the hearing on house bill 27 i wasn't able i was going to call in and i actually was sick in the hospital but i just wanted to say that there's a few things in this bill that are really important to us that we ask for and i know that what i heard it was ocs said that they do all these things um but some of the things that are really important to us are um ensuring that youth are ready to be released from care um if they're 18 or over i know that they said that they um they hold a hearing or make sure that youth are ready we have youth here today who are being asked to leave the system or who have been released without notice who didn't have a high school diploma ged housing were absolutely unprepared and have spent nearly their entire lives in foster care have moved schools have moved multiple change in home placements um also reducing um the time to finding permanency the federal standards says that we're we're supposed to work within 12 to 24 months to ensure that youth either go home or place an adoptive placement guardianship relative care that they move quickly out of our system and we're spending a lot more money by leaving young people in care for 15 years but we should also be working to find a permanent family because we do more damage by keeping them in our system they fall behind in school they struggle as adults with housing homelessness higher education um it also requires foster parent recruitment um we the number of children in our state system is going up right now it's at 2400 it's a record high um and it's increasing the state continues to take custody of more youth we don't have enough workers or time um for workers to be able to get out and actually even see children in their homes um and finally it um also supports some information sharing with tribes early on so that if the case is screened out they can um they can let the tribe know if it is if a family that is a member of that tribe so they can they can ideally intervene and provide um support and intervention early on so we can avoid young people coming into our system we all believe that as young people in the system the state is our parent and so um again i appreciate you allowing time today for me to come and speak and for our youth to to show you that well thank you any questions no questions okay thank you very much and thank you for the youth that have appeared today before us it was very impressive thank you very much yes we're next going to be taking uh hb 40 e-cigarettes welcome representative herron please come forward and address us yes thank madam chair and committee members bob herron representative from health district 38. welcome welcome so um madam chair i'd just like to make a real short statement my staff rob is here and more importantly there's others here that wish to testify the reason i introduced this legislation is i appreciate the fact that there are products that people can buy like e-cigarettes and it's their right and i have no problem with it with the device at all the issue though is there might not be any smoke there might not be any ash but the issue with me is how does a person dispose of the extra exhaled aerosol safely and it doesn't harm others so that's why i would like to see the use of these devices be taken to a place where people are allowed to smoke and that's why the moving into the definition and i'm available for questions but others would like to testify yes any questions of representative heron see no questions we'll proceed with additional witnesses that wish to testify i have here a misty jensen is she available miss jensen yes i'm here welcome thank you i'm in wazzilla yes for the record uh please state your name and spell your surname and tell us of any affiliation you have okay my name is misty michelle jensen my last name is j-e-n-s-e-n any affiliation miss jensen no i'm just speaking as a constituent thank you you may proceed thank you i want to testify in favor of hb 40 and the importance of treating electronic cigarettes the same as traditional cigarettes with regard to secondhand smoke the vapor from an e-cigarette is not water vapor but is in fact an aerosol that contains nicotine and toxic chemicals and that is from the cdc it's not safe to smoke or inhale as a mother of two daughters aged 11 and 14 i'm horrified by the messages that they see in ads and in stores promoting e-cigarettes as safe this simply is not true we are in danger of the renormalization of smoking with the emergence of these new products and as leaders and decision makers and healthcare we must send a clear message that smoking includes the use of electronic cigarettes thank you thank you for your testimony are there any questions of this witness thank you we'll go on to our next witness we do have someone in the audience um miss emily ninon can you come up and uh for the record tell us your names spell your surname and your affiliation of any thank you welcome thank you it's pleasure to be before you for the record my name is emily neenan my last name is spelled n-e-n-o-n i am the alaska government relations director for the american cancer society cancer action network and pleased to be here before you again today on this topic of electronic cigarettes i have submitted a letter that you should have in your packets also did respond to the committee aide with some information that representative stutz had asked some questions for some more information when i was here on tuesday so those citations are there and i'm just want to mention there are hundreds of different uh products on the market being marketed as electronic cigarettes and they are unregulated which means we don't know what's in any given one of them i'm not here to talk about their use as a cessation device this bill doesn't address that we're strictly looking at exposure to the secondhand aerosol as the previous testifier mentioned the difference between a vapor as a state of matter versus an aerosol and aerosol contains fine particles unlike a vapor of either liquid solid or both there are a number of growing number of studies that have looked at the contents of e-cigarette aerosol propylene glycol nicotine and flavorings were most commonly found in that e-cigarette aerosol and other studies have found the aerosol to contain heavy metals volatile organic compounds tobacco-specific nitrosamines and other potentially harmful chemicals which is why we're concerned about second-hand exposure and with that i'd be happy to answer any further questions the the committee may have and continue to carry on this conversation through the process yes uh representative stood thank you i'm looking at my information here and i have lots of information from people that say they don't support house bill 40 but i don't see any any of the studies or any of that information that you're speaking of now maybe since we're going to leave this open you could drop it by my office but but i i'm interested in actually seeing the studies seeing how current they are and seeing how firm they are because everything that i've been able to uh find myself and read it's maybe possibly could be and it appears that there's just not enough information to classify these as a tobacco type cigarette i i read several articles the recent most recent is uh march 12 2015 new study finds no health concerns in e-cigarette vapors so you know this is clearly a pretty controversial issue and i certainly wouldn't expect you to take any other position than you've taken being that you work for the american cancer society but i i still and again i say maybe there's evidence that i haven't seen but i'm just not convinced that this is that there's enough evidence to say and without seeing the actual studies and who they're by and how current they are and that they're actually solid i i'm having a hard time with this thank you representative any other questions of this witness if i may i do have the the documents that um i uh emailed to the committee aide earlier i have those in my hand here be happy to give those to you and carry on this uh be happy to continue the conversation and and and compare notes with what we're all learning here about these new products thank you and uh was that distributed to everyone here i'll give it to you and we can make sure copies are made for everyone thank you thank you so much for your time appreciate it and the next witness is also present in the room dr butler would you uh step up and thank you madam chairman uh for the record my name is jay butler uh what am i i'm the chief medical officer in the department of health and social services it may well be that aerosols from e-cigarettes pose less of a threat from second-hand exposure than traditional cigarettes but i would caution against assuming that they are safe given that studies have shown that metabolites of nicotine are recoverable from people who are exposed to aerosols from e-cigarettes second hand the division struck has struggled also with this question of where do e-cigarettes fall on the spectrum of risk and recently completed a literature review so i'll be happy to get a copy of that to the to the entire committee so that you would have that for reference as well thank you dr butler um you know there is potential for uh e-cigarettes as a harm reduction technique perhaps even for a smoking cessation tool uh but i think it's important to keep in mind that some of the data suggests that actually e-cigarettes are being used as a way to deliver supplemental nicotine to people who currently smoke rather than as replacement for smoking and in fact when you look at some of the way the product is marketed uh the majority are talking about ways that you can smoke when smoking's not allowed i also wanted to raise the concern about uh the fact that we've made a lot of progress in smoking reduction among our young people yet the way e-cigarettes are being marketed with flavors like cherry crush peachy keens skittles bubble gum captain crunch chocolate treat vanilla dreams these are seem to be going for a much younger demographic than the marlboro man is going to appeal to so i think as we struggle with this question of uh what are the threats there's two that i wanted to highlight one has already been highlighted by one of our one of the constituents who called in is that is that e-cigarettes pose the threat of renormalizing smoking behavior and i think that's particularly a challenge for our younger people also given what we do know is in the aerosols as well as what we don't know because it's not a regulated product it's considered proprietary information i think it does pose a threat to indoor air quality therefore the goals of hb 40 to allow e-cigarette use only in places where cigarette smoking is not prohibited makes good public health sense and i thank you for the opportunity to speak to you thank you are there any questions of dr butler no questions thank you and we look forward to the written materials you refer to thank you the next witness is on the line and ashley perter hello i'm here yes thank you for the record please identify yourself and your affiliation of any okay my name is ashley pelt here my last name is spelled p-e-l-t-i-e-r and i'm here today representing myself i live in bolton was the law i'm here today in support of hb40 to ask you to treat electronic cigarettes the same as traditional cigarettes in regard to second-hand smoke exposure the vapor emitted by these devices has been shown to contain ultrafine particles that when inhaled exhaust exacerbate respiratory issues such as asthma the vapor is also known to contain chemicals such as benzene cadmium and formaldehyde additionally as dr butler mentioned mentioned flavored vape juices such as cotton candy and gummy bear are particularly enticing to use which is concerning to me i'd also like to state that there was a time when the tobacco industry told us that second-hand smoke was harmless and not only that it was harmless but that smoking was good for us we now know different and i am reluctant to trust the tobacco industry when they say that e-cigarettes and second-hand aerosol are safe nobody should be unwillingly exposed to a substance that can harm them and i ask you to support hb40 because everyone deserves the right to breathe clean air thank you thank you are there any questions of this witness cnn will thank you very much we'll proceed to our next witness a mr clay bessanick yeah do you hear me yes clearly yeah hello there my name's clay beznick my name is uh glassbell last name is b-e-z-e-n-e-k and the affiliation you know just myself as a as a citizen of the state welcome you may proceed thank you thank you very much i learned a lot of stuff today about uh a lot of things other than other than this so it was a good good time sitting on the phone hanging out um the uh yeah i'm i'm definitely against house bill 48 i really understand the reasoning behind it for sure i think that possibly some federal legislation should be in the works to regulate the industry however i i commercial fish for salmon here in southeast and the rest of the year i worked on tugboats and i i know firsthand numerous people that have quit smoking because of e-cigarettes and being a non-smoker myself i i've i've actually got on different tug boats because the whole crew smoked except me and it was so annoying to have to smell smoke in a tight confined space such as a tugboat even though it's 100 feet long it was just you know stupid i grew up in a smoking family so i'm pretty pretty anti-smoking actually and i've seen the e-cigarette industry come out i think it's a real positive step for the tobacco industry to to do what they're doing um but i think the regulation is a little is a little premature on uh on vilifying people as it were to make them step outside or going uh in a another part of a facility when i i haven't seen the information and believe me if i'm gonna smoke or if i'm gonna smell second-hand smoke even from an e-cigarette i've i've done a lot of research myself and until i find out that that it's it's not a it's or it's a bad thing for me then i'll definitely be against it but i just think that uh house bill 40 is just a little bit possibly before it's time so i think you're i thank you for the ability to testify thank you for patiently waiting i see you've waited almost two hours to testify so thank you any questions of this witness well thank you this will be unfortunately our last witness we have to go to the floor to consider the budget i realized there are there's 14 or 15 other individuals that would like to testify um we will keep public testimony open we will hold hb 40 over for more discussions at a later date and for more witnesses to speak on the issue and we'll have to adjourn i'm sorry anyway you
Um86WQ3M1FM,WI,1-5-2016,"we're gonna start the Committee on consumer protection public hearing we have a number of bills today representative Scott who is running a little late today I expect him to be in later but we're gonna get started on his advice we have five bills today Assembly Bill 333 actually we're gonna why don't we do the Pledge of Allegiance [Music] one nation and then why don't we take the role - yes sir [Music] German crew is running late vice-chair Heaton your representative cats both represented Nealon it was a nurse in here he's a van der Meer represents a Niki yeah represent hope and represent um five makes a quorum okay we do have a quorum and we're gonna get started with the first bill the first bill is Assembly Bill 333 relating to the possession of certain wild animals and providing a penalty we have a number of speakers today we're gonna start with the the authors represent of Kirkman and Senator Walker and proceed whenever you're ready well good morning everybody mr. chairman and members of the committee for hearing this bill today weekly thank you some bill 333 keep Wisconsin communities and their non-native species currently Wisconsin is one of only five states that does not have some form of statewide regulation statutes regarding ownership of wild animals as pets certain dangerous species of animals simply do not belong in homes throughout Wisconsin's communities some exotic pet owners may eventually realize that they cannot provide a suitable habitat or that the animal has simply grown to be too big for them to handle and in other cases these types of animals may escape these situations pose a serious threat to neighborhoods and since police animal Kirk animal control and other emergency personnel are usually the first ones called on to the scene the strains already limited resources from local governments recently in Pleasant Prairie law enforcement were called to a scene and removed a crocodile and two alligators and as we've seen in Milwaukee when a dangerous non-native animal was spotted in a neighborhood tremendous local efforts and resources are diverted to the address where the situation has occurred municipalities in recognizing the threat of these animals close to communities have taken it upon themselves to Knack prohibitions and the local level and this creates a hodgepodge of inconsistent laws a B 333 would fix that by creating a statewide law that will bring uniformity and make Wisconsin consistent with other states this bill also creates a reasonable exemption for entities that are accredited by various Zula organizations why the United States in order to acquire a license the facility must meet a series of guidelines and maintain standards that cover quality care adequate living space and sanitation among many others this bill does not require that individuals currently in possession of these dangerous animals give them up it does however require that the register their animal with their municipality animals that fall under this prohibition are non-native big cats including lions and tigers non-native bears including brown bears of polar bears apes including gorillas chimpanzees and Gibbons and croc crocodilians including alligators crocodiles and Caymans this is a common-sense bill that will keep Wisconsin communities and their first responders safe I has received wide support from law enforcement and local government groups including the League of Wisconsin municipalities Milwaukee Police Association Wisconsin professional association Wisconsin reelers Association and Wisconsin Animal Control Association as well as many independent individuals and organizations and I encourage you to support this legislation as well I now turn it over to representative Kirkland thank you so much and it's great to be here to testify and assembly bill 333 the senator has pretty much covered most of my testimony I did just want to point out then again it it is not our intention to prevent zoos and those that are already regulated I just wanted to highlight that we are working on an amendment or have the amendment ready and again so the bill is like just a common-sense approach we all watched and bated breath when the lion was on the loose in Milwaukee I don't know if there was not in that media market but I know every time I turned on on the news for a few weeks we were all waiting to see where was a kind of weird small but we'll where's alignment initially for a while there my two young sons that are 10 and 8 kind of gotten involved in the in the where's where's the lie on that today so again this is this common-sense approach I appreciate working with my senator this is the first time we get to testify together so far this year we've worked quite a few things together though in history so it's kind of fun so thanks so much for this opportunity just like to add this if I could also we've been working with stakeholders from different different zoos and organizations and we are working on a an amendment that will allow them to continue to exist and do what is necessary for them to have their their business continued to flourish so we have identified a couple of issues as an example one of those is with the crocodilians and identifying organizations that would certify individuals so we're kind of working on a couple things there that we hope to have resolved here in the relatively immediately near future so we have had a lot of input I think this would be a good thing we had the the issues that that brought the this forward with Milwaukee and the big cat the quote/unquote alleged big cat because we never did determine you know that it was a big cat with the exception of what was there as far as that short video clip that probably everybody saw but it was never brought back into custody so we don't know what happened but the point is that there were hundreds of hours of man-hours with law enforcement and emergency personnel and people fearful of their lives and that's what prompted us this whole process starting we had started working on this well before that had occurred that incident occurred in Milwaukee and this was relatively a simple issue that we're trying to bring to the forefront for law enforcement purposes to protect emergency personnel so that's the thrust of this it's not to put anybody out of business I serve on the Racine zoo board I've been there for about 15 years now we do a lot of good things we protect the species it's a good way for people to be able to interact with with wildlife so we'll open for questions [Music] but as far as the difference between the two I don't know if I'm the best person here at only connect them then what Thank You mr. chair human what is something you should have the amendment it's uh lrb zero seven eight six can you tell us what it does what it does but we also have certain exceptions for making it out an easy better to do a circus a whole list of other things one of the things that the amendment does is it adds to this list of exceptions an entity that is accredited isn't a credit member of the Zoological Association of America and the person who holds a USDA license that allows a person possess an order from the Wisconsin cell transfer or breed a dangerous exotic animal that's one of the changes that's made the other change that the bill makes the amendment rather Davis's animals the bill prohibits allowing a member of the public to come into direct contact with a dangerous decided animal someone who breaks this prohibition will be subject to a forfeiture of $2,000 grant with the draft amendment would rules this prohibition those are the changes that I made by the amendment [Music] so we're adding an entity on possessing a dangerous exotic animal but there's an exception to that prohibition for a long list of certain types of people or entities including aza accredited zoo zoo that's operated by a municipality or County a circus circus world a wildlife sanctuary there are two other ones as well the draft amendment would add to this list of entities or people that would have an exception to the prohibition against possessing a dangerous inside animal and the two people or entities that would be added to this list of exceptions are Zoological Association of America that if accredited zoo and a person who holds a USDA license that permits the person to possess import sell transfer or breed their dangerous exotic animal Center wandered you have a comment I saw that basically what was happened here is we have added the za who you will be hearing from it's another organization that is a credit and oppress smaller's whose individuals that that might possess those animals and they are under these different organizations have specific guidelines that an individual who is going to say have a zoo or or something like that if they're gonna go for the accreditation they have to meet a whole laundry list of things size of the confinement for whatever the animal is food water lighting heat the environment proper licensure proper insurance etcetera all those things become part of it and they can expand on what that is but it's different than the Zoological Association the aza that's a different organization my understanding is DEA has been around about a decade and there's the aza has been around for quite a bit longer than that so it's just another organization the exception that was removed with being able to come in contact I can tell you that as a board member from the Racine Zoological Association we count on people making contact with the animals that we are trying to preserve because that allows people to interact with those animals were in the wild they would never be able to do that as an example we have Bo and Mac who are giraffes and we have throughout the day a giraffe encounter and that giraffe encounter allows individuals to be able to feed these wonderfully delicious wafers that they love and it gets them to interact with that animal to the point of near contact because they are you know feeding the animal in that long tongue comes out picks up that cracker these types of encounters like that and special behind-the-scenes counters help to be able to fund the zoo because it is a private public partnership and it allows the individuals to see these animals as more than just a zebra or a giraffe now it's Bo and Mac you know so there's a personal contact there so that they have a better understanding they get better educated as to what we're trying to do with the Conservancy with these animals when I was on the county board and also served on the zoo board we would have a couple times a year we would have meetings with the county board and tell them where we're at with our fundraising and projects that we are working on for these animals to make the environments better and we would bring animals in to the boardroom to allow for those members to be able to handle those animals who come in real amend so they could kind of get an idea what we were we're trying to do with their educational process with a school system I said it because it works for a real close so those were in the original bill those prohibitions for for making contact that was taken out you know and we would not have somebody petting a lion in the setting that we have I mean we have we have little lion cubs that we just had to not not too long ago but we don't allow we do not allow in our setting for what we have we don't allow the interaction with the public our handlers handle them of course you know until they get to a point where you know they're old enough that they could take your hand off and they are wild animals this this bill would allow any one of those facilities as an example we have we have one one exhibitor in the Wisconsin Dells that actually raises animals and matter of fact our lion came from that breeder that just just died here recently it was an older animal but from years ago came from that that breeder and that breeder does allow their cubs to be in a contact situation under supervision of their handlers up to a point where it's it's safe for that to occur I've been there I've seen that I ever but I agree with it on the way that it's being conducted I've actually taken tours behind the scene towards impromptu with what they they do at their facility in the Dells and they are above the average for for most most organizations that do this as you know as an exhibitor and maintain those animals so I see it as a good thing and that's why the this was included in the amendment the USDA thing was for USDA certifications because basically you have to go through a bunch of Hoops to get to that point where you can receive those specific license to the USDA that someone who violates this new law would be required to forfeit up to $1,000 if someone is wealthy enough to possess an exotic animal like a lion is $1,000 enough of a deterrent or when people view this penalty is more like a licensing fee well I guess it's like anything we could make it a hundred thousand dollars but if I'm a multi-millionaire of delay then what's that that's a drop in a bucket - I think what ends up happening is once you have a violation there's there's more than just a fine like anything coming from law enforcement probably the most the most interesting word that that gets involved yes when you start talking quote-unquote liability so if somebody's done something and they've violated something and they have been fined and they have had to pay the fine all of a sudden the liability for that seemingly little thousand dollar fine gets involved in the insurance coverages etc etc etc so all that comes to bear then and those individuals that that do step out and do this as a business they do it with the understanding this is their their life's work this is their their life's business and you're not gonna see the individual like that knowingly violating you know law I don't believe because they've also been partners in doing this legislation sure I appreciate that answer thank you um do you see in any way in Section via that penalty where you might be limiting the liability because it says if a person violates this statute and a dangerous exotic animal causes property damage or attacks an individual the person may be required to port but not more than $2,000 so does that capping their liability in some way by saying that well if they do attack somebody they're not going to be charged criminally they're going to be have up to a $2,000 penalty well they would still they would go up to $2,000 per the criminal penalty that would be you know there'd be an additional dollar amount there and it would increase the probably what you'd consider the severity of what they're being charged with but as far as limiting their liability no I mean if somebody goes out and they do do something that is contrary to safe handling and safe practices and closures when you're certified through any one of these these areas like the ACA the CAA you have to have protocols in place for containment for the animal and then as an initial containment that's secondary and then third containment and you have to have response plans you have to work with the municipality to make sure that that everybody is on the same page you have to have your insurance people involve inspections I mean it goes on and on so if you do a violation and it's determined that there is negligence in how this animal was kept or they ought not just didn't follow the rules their liability is not going to be limited by how much they are actually fine they could get slam-dunked depending on whatever the issue was one of your life councils to municipalities or counties currently have the ability to enact ordinances relating to exotic animals yes and I just want to pop sure okay I just follow up on that because the village of Pleasant Prairie which we represent does have put on because of situations that we've had down in Kenosha County so and again that's attached to my testimony so if you had my shirt okay just one other quick thing in response to that also some time back we had a gentleman who I came to know very well that had a crocodile and Dino and he was challenged for possession of this crocodile and of course the city came out wrote him a ticket and we're seen he fought it he fought it all the way to the Supreme Court one short time thereafter dr. Greg Meyer from a professor from UW Parkside helped draft the local ordinance to be able to allow this individual to have this this animal and and other animals because actually when they they did they're they're drafting initially those city you couldn't had a goldfish in the city of the way was drafted so that's one of the reasons why we're doing this so we have a baseline but it also is a way that we can educate people and educate our law enforcement emergency personnel so that they're aware you know what is available out there so we do have in some cases some localities that have ordinances in place which if it's stricter than this they'll still be able have those ordinances question for lunch counsel and then we'll go to die oh then we'll go to representatives in it thank you I'm not for this bill I think the original bill is a very good bill I have concerns with the amendment that you made me introducing that he gets going to weaken the bill I especially ever concern with with the way the amendments would pretty much allow for the interaction with while damaged and I've been to the receipt sue both of you it is one of the best Sue's I think in the state I love that suit I've been behind this no I do small children it is the best zoo to take your kids to in this data Wisconsin but any other I'm like my grandchildren I but behind the scenes at Milwaukee County Zoo and I'd strongly you know believe in education as far as dealing with animals I do have concerned with now you brought up there you know we there is a resort in Wisconsin that uses lion cubs as a promotional tool and they allow children to interact with them do either you know help it's just those lions when you're done with them do they get shipped to zoos around the country do they get shipped to private wildlife sanctuaries where do these Cubs go when they become too old to sit on children's laps I'm sure you're gonna have a little bit of testimony about that okay some of these animals go to the theatrical movie makers they are sold to other zoos I know that circuses I know our r1 lion that that came to us was of course hand raised and of course this changes the a little bit of the demeanor of the animal because it is you can't domesticate to the point where it can be a house cat but you can definitely do some things so that it is more receptive to to people in that environment and this is what they have done by being able to allow that interaction but I think the most important part of that where we're allowing that to happen that's got to be done of the guidance of the people that are supervising the animal number one and of course their insurance carrier [Music] all those things come into play when an animal like this is allowed to come in contact if you've been down our zoo and if you've done done behind the scenes in Milwaukee zoo I've fed the black rhino I've had the an Tyrande bears I've fed the Penguins and the cold and they're at the closure and a little slimy with the sardines but I mean it was really an it was a fun type of interaction that helped me understand more what the plight of these animals are too but it's done in a in a way that it's a controlled environment so you know I would not recommend allowing people to step into a enclosure with a lion or a bear or any one of those even our handlers don't do that they don't step directly into the enclosure with those animals of course unless they're the Cubs when their work what the cops but once they get to a certain age they stop interacting also just for the record I think if the amendment is introduced I will remove myself as an author that's a qualification I'm not comfortable are there any more questions of course we received a lot of information about prior to getting through today and a lot of the information I received regarding za a and aza is that aza there's a huge difference in how stringent rules are between the two of them did that become aware we were made aware of that it become part of your consideration when you this I think further we're just trying to find a common balance I mean you know the situations they happen in in my counties again trying to not have a patchwork trying to come up with something that if a municipality does have something again you can have something strictures on the books but trying to actually make something that statewide uniform that is workable I think was important to me now I like unlike well we could that entity has their accreditation there you know just because it's not the same as the other one doesn't mean they're not a good organization in my eyes I guess you know there are many different things that scratch my brain real quick you know thinking something outside of exotica animals right off the top of my head here where you have organizations that are multi faceted that serve a different purpose that are the same goal is to have people interacting again now I have not had the experience that ban has behind the scenes to interact with animals my interaction with animals has been out on the farm dealing more with you know the farm animals and dealing with it I haven't had the experience of you know feeding any penguins or giraffes but I would I would want you know if that opportunity came available to me and my children I would allow that there there's also some some criteria you're gonna hear about this from the za and the aza representatives that are here like as example our our mission in Racine is for endangered species and so we have to look at all the different endangered species where and I'm not sure that the that the CAA is just all endangered species for what we do for ours for our accreditation and we look for a different level of a credit for what are the results would be like me as an accent investigator and actually reconstructionist I go to Joe's accident reconstruction accreditation school and I give training and I get an accreditation from Valley and there are people on the other side that don't think Joe's is good enough but I also have enough from northwestern traffic Institute which is pretty much the top of the line but I choose to go to both of those and have both of those accreditations or maybe I I like Joe's because Joe's admit instead of me going to a four-year college of getting a four-year degree I go to a two-year Technical College and get something that I have a skill set that I can have a business I mean it's all in the eye of the beholder the importance here is that the accreditation is that we have like represent Kirkman brought forward is that we're looking for having credibility in the process and we are looking for the credibility to be a reasonable credibility the CAA is the one that has been added here they are a I think 11 years old or 12 years old Sampson is more than a decade old so they are I guess they are relatively a newcomer because it's only done a decade but it decades a lot of time I mean you can tell whether they're bad actors in there they're they're not gonna do what they say they're gonna do that's not the norm I mean that's not what's happened they do what they say they're gonna do do have the requirements but they might might work with a different type of animal - or a different type of business that's some you're gonna have to be able to ask them and they'll be able to kind of drill down with that well some use licensed through the USDA as an example here you go again you've got federal entities that have specific requirements for you to have the license issued that licensure they have specific requirements they have inspections that occur they are pretty ruthless with their inspections you can have a cobweb in an enclosure and you can get dinged for that you can lose your license a cobweb in an enclosure well you sure can I mean that's that's one of those things where if you're not cleaning the enclosure properly and you're not caring for that animal properly these are the things that they need to look for I just threw that out as an example they can give you specifics on that too when they come up and talk about the USDA and they talk about the CAA what they actually look for I think that we're looking at credibility when I qualify for my law enforcement carry concealed under the federal law I have to go by those guidelines with a federal law puts forward and they don't cut any corners I have to do it exactly what they tell me and exactly what my department requires they don't say well yeah you were pretty close so we're gonna give it to you you either do what it says you you don't get to be able to have a carry concealed permit for law enforcement that's different than me going and getting to carry concealed license to carry in the state because it's not the same level of requirement I mean so there's different levels for what purposes you want to do to solve this is where you know the USDA kind of drills down and there's some separate things with that for sales and propagation they can give you the whole list of those - there's a whole bunch of different licenses on the USDA that would qualify I got one more for pledged counsel is there anywhere in state statute that provides a legal definition for Pat I'm not aware of that but I can seeing no other questions sorry DNR they control any domestic and that's from the state dear our local brown bears those type types of things they do not have jurisdiction over wild animals that are exotic thank you not from just to reminder to folks that members will be coming and going like myself I apologize you for not being here anyways next up to testify Melissa Teatro and Debbie Leahy from the Humane Society of the US speaking in favor yeah [Music] chairman Krug and members of the committee thank you very much for the opportunity to testify this morning my name is Melissa Tedrow and I'm the Wisconsin State Director for the Humane Society of the United States on behalf of HS us and our supporters and members in Wisconsin I urge you to support this bill a b 333 as introduced and without adding any amendments that would compromise public safety a B 333 will prohibit the future private ownership of certain dangerous exotic animals just some namely non-native big cats bears apes alligators and crocodiles this bill has reasonable exemptions for zoos accredited by the Association of zoos and aquariums municipal zoos wildlife sanctuaries research facilities and circuses people who currently possess the handful of species named in the bill can keep them until the animals die but they will not be allowed to acquire replacements dangerous exotic animals can cause death and inflict serious injury they spread deadly disease they require substantial space specialized husbandry safe handling escape-proof housing and costly care during life spans that can run several decades keeping these animals and substandard environments not only poses a danger to people it places animals who can live 20 30 or even 60 years and sad and miserable conditions the average person simply does not have the knowledge and resources to provide safe and humane long-term care care for species such as tigers lions and chimpanzees an element of this bill that my organization especially supports is its prohibition on public contact public contact with certain dangerous wild animals is unsafe especially for children it's also harmful to animals and leads to excessive breeding of species like tigers commonly used in photo ops when they are young and I have a lot more information about tiger cub photos in wisk throughout the country if you'd like that besides the obvious physical dangers there hidden dangers wild animals can spread deadly viral bacterial fungal and parasitic infections that pose serious health risks to humans the ban on public contact included in this bill as it's been introduced has widespread support including from the association of zoos and aquariums the National Association of State Public Health veterinarians the Wisconsin Hospital Association and numerous agencies that represent law enforcement and emergency responders the bill as a whole has widespread of support from Wisconsin organizations including the League of Wisconsin municipalities the Wisconsin towns Association the Wisconsin professional Police Association the Milwaukee Police and Professional Firefighters Association the Milwaukee County Zoo the Racine zoo which is an AZ a zoo I might mention the Henry Vilas Zoo the new Zoo the International crane foundation the Wisconsin Animal Control Foundation and many more as you've heard already this morning our state is one of just five with almost no laws concerning the private possession of dangerous exotic animals in fact Wisconsin is surrounded by states with stronger laws and will likely attract a growing and expensive problem as the rest of the country continues to crackdown on this issue the passage of a b 333 will finally put into place a state law that prohibits keeping certain dangerous exotic animals as pets we urge the committee to support this bill and to preserve its original ban on public contact thank you hey t-bone okay good morning chairman crowd new members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today my name is Debbie Leahy I'm manager of captive wildlife protection at the Humane Society of the United States and as Melissa mentioned we were in support of Assembly Bill 333 as introduced and we would urge you not to add any exemptions to the bill that would substantially weakened it this sensible legislation will protect public safety and will promote animal welfare by limiting the future private ownership of dangerous exotic animals to qualified facilities such as those accredited by the Association of zoos and aquariums or aza we urge you to reject any amendments they would add exemptions for facilities accredited by the Zoological Association of America or CAA or for facilities licensed by the USDA CAA as an organization at accredits poorly run roadside zoos they have failed to meet AC ace more comprehensive and stringent standards zah counts among its facilities and members individuals who have been convicted of felonies wildlife trafficking and Cruelty to Animals attempts to exempt CAA facilities from state dangerous wild animal laws were defeated in California Louisiana Michigan Texas and less than two months ago in Clark County Nevada where 2za a backyard Missouri's have caused a significant burden to County officials who have had to deal with safety and code violations at the facility's CA facilities offer unsafe public contact with 90 pound bears as well as tiger and lion cubs and even chimpanzees and orangutans people have been critically injured and suffered permanent disabilities from attacks by animals ranging from elephants to big cats to chimpanzees at facilities operated by CAA members zah deficiencies are clearly illustrated in one of the organization's own accreditation inspection reports mm-hmm included with this testimony is an example of a za a inspection of Wright Park Zoo a facility was a hundred and twenty six animals including big cats bears and primates the inspection was conducted by a za co-founder and the zoo's own veterinarian rather than an independent team with no affiliation to the facility the inspection took just two and a half hours which is an insufficient amount of time to conduct a thorough inspection of facilities animals enclosures and buildings protocols and records as well as conduct staff interviews and in contrast the minimum inspection time for an accreditation inspection by aza even for a smaller facility would be two days since CAA is an adequate accreditation inspection the USDA has cited Wright Park Zoo for 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act including 13 citations for cages and disrepair for citations for a failure to address the psychological well-being of primates and three citations for poor sanitation despite these problems with both the CAA and USDA inspections this facility continues doing business as usual this is a clear example of the inadvisability of weakening a b 333 to exempt the CAA and USDA facilities similarly a blanket exemption for USDA licensees would render the bill and effective since pet owners can easily acquire a USDA exhibitor license to circumvent the intent of the state law further the federal Animal Welfare Act is weak and is poorly enforced by an understaffed agency with only 126 USDA inspectors who are responsible for inspecting more than 10,000 facilities there are not nearly enough inspectors to provide regular oversight USDA licensees can and do keep animals and inhumane and unsafe conditions you know still comply with the law licenses are easy to obtain but once licensed it's very difficult for the agency to revoke and the licenses are automatically renewed every year even if there are chronic and serious problems at the facility we have proposed an alternative amendment that would essentially grandfather all existing USDA licensees there currently possess dangerous exotic species and that meets some basic criteria relating to public safety and animal care this compromise would mitigate opposition to the bill by a number of private owners while preventing the problem in Wisconsin from getting worse restricting especially dangerous species to qualified professionally run and fiscally responsible facilities is fair reasonable and necessary and we urge your support to this bill thank you any questions for members came at the same time thanks for your testimony both of you I'm interested in knowing if you'd be open to amendment to increase penalties for possessing animals that pose public safety threat or if they were to attack somebody would you be open to amendment to increase penalties from about up to $1,000 we we don't have an issue with that we've also recommended that insurance requirements be added to the poem do you think there is anything in the bill that should address how like in my understanding my reading there's nothing that would require them to give up the animal that they had was that there's a grandfather clause so do you think there should be anything in statute that outlines away humanely obtain a dangerous animal somebody that's possessing them that might not be able to you know have a license or care for them properly is there anything in the law that outlines how the state would handle that situation opposed to just well if somebody's currently possesses one of these species they'd be covered under the grandfather clause and so you're asking what if even though they're and they're not fit to have that alligator in this law all we would says there's thousand dollar five there would be nothing in my reading ability to confiscate that alligator you mainly send them to a shelter or sanctuary do we need to think that next step to outline how we handle that moving forward or is it sufficient just penalize down the thousand dollar client because in my reading it seems like if they just paid the $1,000 fine it's almost like a license you know I see what you're saying yeah just see my thing state law you're concerned about certain yes someone someone was to include a provision that if an animal is confiscated first the owner is responsible for to pay for the cost of caring for the animal during the confiscation and if it's determined that the animal has to be relocated then there's usually a provision that the animal has to go to an accredited sanctuary oh yeah well you've been burned by my concerns about can you talk a little bit more about the US Department of Geography yeah first of all licensing by the USDA is it's a legal requirement for facilities exhibiting regulated species which is most mammals all you have to do is make sure you send in your annual renewal fee before it expires and you're automatically renewed it doesn't matter if you were just sighted the day before for 50 serious violations or doesn't matter if the agency has charges pending against you and is seeking you no penalty or license revocation they just automatically will renew your license every year and another difference I wanted to point out between aza NCAA and re-accreditation technically aza does not react Redditt a zoo once the zoo's accredited that accreditation lasts for five years and at the end of the at five years they start from scratch they have to go through this whole entire lengthy accreditation process all over again and that ensures that you know place doesn't get accredited and then just kind of slides they're always on their toes they're always having to comply with ACA increasingly stronger standards because these standards are always evolving and changing to make things better for the animals to make things safer for keepers and these zoos you have to constantly you know upgrade how they take care of the animals to comply with this accreditation for CAA the they do offer re-accreditation x' at the end of five years and yet re-accreditation just requires a single inspector to go to the facility so that's clearly insufficient you confirmed like so you you're in possession of a line or pair of lines or five lines and your grandfather through this what if well they'd be in violation of the law I mean I think I think that you know it would allow the local authorities to confiscate well it depends on the species we've documented some CAA facilities using bear cubs and lion cubs for photo ops of the public and then sending the animals to slaughter after they get too big for handling in the case of tigers sometimes they end up warehouse we know of at least two exhibitors in Wisconsin that have an excess of two dozen tigers each so they you know can just end up being warehoused in somebody's fire do you see our animals who can live for 20 years at our responsible here in Wisconsin yeah there's one facility they offered to give two tigers to an undercover ABC News 20/20 reporter he just you know had so many he was willing to get rid of them so you know there's concerns that they just end up warehouse they get sold into the pet trade there's conservationists are very concerned about this practice because it could be fueling the illegal black market and Tiger parts there's no federal agency they attracts these Tigers so nobody nobody knows for sure where they end up Thank You mr. cherrick I really hope this amendment what we'll do that every see it represents Nicky it is cheer thank you for looking forward but I think we took the Emir's our top mice on the grandfather issue and I know you've been working with stuff we're just as far as the USDA goes what does their involvement in you said you know there's no national well the USDA enforces the federal Animal Welfare Act this was a law that was written in 1966 not much he has changed in a law since then so the standards are very outdated and it just basically we you know gives some specifications about you have to provide animals with veterinary care food water shelter there's are a few more specific things for some different species like primates you have to give them environmental enrichment for their psychological well-being but it's the same law this same law applies to zoos they had applies to research facilities circuses puppy mills it's just it's one long it's it's very minimal these are very minimal standards so when you talk about the USDA and I remember years ago I tried before to the pet store to the USDA they do at that point we did not have the kind of branch a USDA it Wisconsin I meant to order Minnesota is that still true well they give to two regions in eastern region and Western and they just have you know a region alive and I think they have you know individual inspectors from the 126 inspectors reside in a state and then have a region typically it's the same inspector that goes to that to the same place so there are inspectors familiar with that area yes I just wanted let's see if let's counsel to clarify something that was just said which was the if somebody has a line and they have lion pups and that would be in violation of the law as my interpretation but she mentioned that they'd be able to confiscate those animals is that true in this legislation would they be able to confiscate those tiger plugs or comes over they only be able to issue a thousand dollar fine for each one so if you are under the bill let me just back up it maybe if you already possess an animal then you go through the registration registration process that's an exception you don't have to be one of those accepted agencies to possess some exotic wild animal if you already have the animal and you go through the registration process with your municipality in the event that it's you're not covered by any sort of exception and you are holding this animal or doing anything else in violation of prohibitions provided in the bill the bill does apply the procedures that we have in current law for the taking of custody of dangerous animals holding animals for cause interview of those seizures it applies those laws that we have correctly on the books for animals to these cases so it is possible that an animal that is possessed in violation of provisions provided the bill would have that animal taken away from them any other questions seeing none thank you very much thank you thank you next up to testify is Alan Smith representing the CAA speaking against all right good morning Thank You mr. chairman Allen Smith I'm at the Zoological Association of America I have pleased to be here to answer some of the questions that have come up here during the hearing I think probably the way to based on what's said so far I probably need to start back in Ohio in in 2011 there was a huge release by a private owner of a lot of dangerous animals lions tigers bears they were all over the county which which adjoins the area where I live and based on that the governor set up a working group which Ohio at that time being like Wisconsin one of the states that didn't have comprehensive regulation at the state level after 67 hours of hearings they finally had talking to everybody who was a conceivably a stakeholder from around the country they finally put a law together the law contained an exemption for our organization as has every other state since Ohio where we where we've asked two things have come up in the previous testimony here and I and a couple of things have but with regard to legislation the the texas bill was never never had a single vote against it in committee in either house it passed the senate onion on the consent calendar it got tied up and like a nine bill package in conference committee on the last day of session and ultimately did not become law but nobody ever voted against it in Clark County which is I mentioned a couple minutes ago we do have two facilities one of them is incidentally the place where all the MGM Lions go from the movies all the retired ones and that's an accredited facility there's another one it used to be a credit is no longer they've you know because they've they've had some problems and they're gonna I think they're gonna reorganize I can't I can't say that with any specificity but they're not really accredited members at this point we've not had any trouble with our accredited members and that's why all the states to date where we've asked for an exemption have given it to us we have there's been a lot of question about the standards I've emailed everybody on the on the all the members comparison chart which you can look at after during the 67 hours of hearings in in Columbus there was only the one fellow from the Toledo Zoo came up with only one difference that he thought was was a weakness and it was a it was a holding it was it could have been a holding cage but it was a minimum cage for snakes and he said too long snakes would have been very uncomfortable in there and we pointed out that it was a minimum size and that's not really a display size it's just you know for transporting and there hasn't been anybody since that has come up with anything specific about our standards that would indicate any kind of weakening we have specific written standards you all have them I've sent you all our policies and our standards that the Association of zoos and aquaria has written guidelines which is why in states like West Virginia last year that wanted written standards they adopted ours by statute we've our exemption as passed just to name the list of states in the last year which have included our standards in the legislation had gone forward at least passed one house North Carolina Kansas of Texas as I mentioned and we actually our exemption became law in two states Arizona and Arkansas I'm gonna I'm going to stop there just to be able to answer the questions if I could mr. chairman I'd be happy to tell you more about our organization we have one accredited member in Wisconsin a wild Wildwood wildlife facility in Managua we have a couple more that someday would like to be oh there was something mentioned about Wright Park Zoo I have to I don't have specifics on that a lot of complaints about our facilities where complaints lodged about things that happen before they became accredited or after they were accredited we have the best safety record in the industry right now we've never had a human fatality which is we're the only nationally zoological crediting Society that can say that any I'm sure you have questions you had plenty before I'm happy to answer them mr. chairman in current form the people who were founders of our organizations several years ago were aza members and they broke off to form their own as a Association essentially so they could spend more time talking about animals instead of talking about gift shops and marketing and things that all the things that zoos have to do the big taxpayer supported zoos yeah well you know all kinds of you know they're their major operations and they have major dues which is why some of and actually I forgot to mention this there are a handful of facilities in the country that are accredited by both of us they're way even there wouldn't be any point if what was said about us was true there would be no point for the Fort Worth Zoo to join for the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium to join they're just for the downtown aquarium to join why would they do it if we were as described earlier and there's a there's a little bit of politics going on here we got a zoo where a big cat jumps out and mauls a kid to death no mention of that we got a facility with a little rust on the fence or a little clod of dirt into drinking water and get written up by the by the USDA or our own inspectors and you know it's a press release so uh you know there's a there's a little bit of that's part of the discrepancy and accept that but to lower the standards I'm not sure how this is a consumer protection committee consumer protection you know lawmakers ought to be worried about public safety and animal welfare there are no important distinctions between the two accredited kinds of facilities and if you if you like if anybody on the committee would like I think I can produce a it's a description I guess a report of one of our facilities that describe the difference in the inspections by CAA and aza when they were done Pittsburgh Zoo most recently I guess I'm sure I could find somebody who could tell you what the differences in the inspections they you know the the amplitude is the same you know they have to be inspected every five years some of our facilities you know where where there have been rumored to be problems or where there has been you know they could show up you know five times in a year that has happened I'm saying that the part about lowering standards is not true yes I'm saying that and and I tell you again the only standard dif that anybody could come up with in 67 hours of hearings in Ohio was the thing about the snake cages that was the only specific that was ever mentioned and and they haven't mentioned it since so I guess it wasn't important oh good question then that's a great question partly because of the dues the big tax payer associate you know supported institutions have no trouble paying twenty five thousand dollars in zoo and in dues every year and you know some of our folks our folks are you know some of them are family businesses so that's a that's pretty big and there's a big difference now and in the biggest difference in philosophy I will tell you at the moment is how to handle elephants and you know there are there are zoos going from one association to the other now based on their understanding and their feeling about the best way to handle elephants whether you allow humans in with them or not that's that's the biggest bone of contention I know about and you know we've we've been asking ever since we've been the subject of these inquiries we've been asking what why why would you be saying this about us you know why what you know what is the evidence of lower standards there isn't there isn't really any I'm sorry Thank You mr. so on this church here huh staff staff would we run it sure yeah no that's our that's our version of course that's your version yeah so I asked the 88 to write one I'm not here to tell you that there are no differences between the associations they do it they're able to do a lot more training they have a lot more staff they have you know a lot more public relations they have a lot of programs that we can't do I'm only saying on the basic differences having to do with the consumer protection that is welfare the animal and I guess what I'd say is I would much rather see something written up a comparison plain outside food and somebody who one group or the other that would benefit let me if you if you want to ask an independent authority we just established that there's an Eastern and a western region for animal care the western region director was at our annual meeting last month asked him call his office and asked him he say what about these guys you know are they are they for real and hearing there's differences major differences between the two organizations and I want to know what those differences are and I and I will follow up on that because I I don't have a lot of thing in a paper like this that was written by one organization that's I mean it so okay if I can ask my question I'm sorry mr. chair if you registered your opposition to this bill or your I had to register an opposition although we certainly don't condone animals wild animals as pets and we'd we'd love to see legislation to do that but we think it's got ancillary stuff in it puts our people out of a baby burn did you register under gav website G a B website I don't know Greg did that you can you come Florida you registered to live here so you're even do a lot of lobbying on decision uh no I we we had somebody that established that we had fallen under the exemption because I've done so I don't know if if we go over it then you know I'd be happy to I'm currently registered in Virginia [Music] do the members of your organization today they hold commercial general liability policies whereby the kind of Oh works wire oh sure that you know the some of these are multimillion-dollar operations not all of them again you know some of them quite smaller but yeah everybody has to have insurance yes sir have any requirements in your in your rules and regulations that remembers have insurance well they have to they already have to abide by you know everything the US Department of Agriculture says all state laws you know ordinances and everything we have the you know we have they have to have insurance but we don't have specific amounts any other questions all right thank you for testimony today yes sir Thank You mr. safe travels next up Rene Pinnell from Fitchburg speaking in favor good morning good morning okay as you heard I'm from Fitchburg representing myself here today in support of the bill as it was originally introduced I absolutely oppose any amendments that would dilute the bills original intent I have a degree in zoology from the University of Wisconsin and I worked at an AZ a accredited facility as a zookeeper for several years during that time I cared for a wide variety of African species and South American species several of which were addressed in this bill throughout my training and experiences as an animal keeper I was made a well made well aware of the dangers that these animals can pose to people and to the public they have instincts and behaviors that must be very carefully managed and as an employee at this saw facility there were very strict rules about how I was allowed to interact with these animals let alone the public so these animals require extreme standards of care and management that cannot be accommodated by the average person they've evolved without human interference for millennia really and they have need that humans typically cannot replicate specifically speaking their diet their exercise needs their social interactions the enrichment humans as hard as we try really struggle to meet these needs private ownership scenarios and roadside zoos typically face an even greater challenge meeting those needs than even an aza accredited facility so although I loved my job as an animal keeper I eventually came to see some downfalls to the animals lives in captivity and I was fortunate enough to work at one of the most highly regarded ACA facilities people might argue that animals who are born in captivity don't know a captive life any different than a life in the wild but I had argue otherwise their DNA's foundation was built upon thousands and in truly millions of years of evolution primates for example can go back millions of years and crocodilians 83 million years placing them in a poorly confined environment is just truly not in their best interest so as you've heard the state of Wisconsin does not have any restrictions regarding the ownership of exotic species this is not a responsible approach and there's dozens of documented situations which demonstrate the public safety issues that arise my support of the bill also stems from my experience working for two large animal welfare organizations specifically humane societies within the Midwest one right here in Wisconsin Humane Societies and animal control entities encounter exotic animal ownership situations on a regular basis for example Dane County Humane Society just as far as I'm aware of in the last several years has taken in a baboon and a kangaroo when people choose to abandon neglect or rehome exotic animals these organizations and public services have to pick up the slack for their responsible behavior and choices of others ultimately leading to costly endeavors for municipalities and taxpayers there are also very limited options and where these animals can go when they're seized from these situations if you look at our national situation with just simply dogs and cats there are millions of animals that cannot be rehomed then you think about exotic animals there's there's only a handful of places these guys can go various local searches online can quickly demonstrate how serious of an issue irresponsible animals ownership is in our community you'll find hundreds of posts a day from people looking to rehome their exotic animals including dangerous snake species monkeys and more for example on Wisconsin's super ads.com there's somebody right here in Madison selling marmoset monkeys in whitewater we've got somebody selling capuchin monkeys this is right now in real time and if you go online you can very easily purchase these kinds of animals for example if you go to backwater reptiles calm with one click of the mouse I can buy an alligator and have it shipped to my house in May of 2013 Kenosha police removed a menagerie of exotic reptiles from a house that had a homemade indoor pond in its basement and dead animals in the backyard it's very easy for people to get away with this so in summary the well-being of animals in our society has been something I've cared about my entire life I don't believe that these animals need to be displayed in roadside zoos or housed in private homes for them to thrive or for the public to value them we can do better as a society and I feel that with with very deep passion there are innumerable resources for us to now gain knowledge and respect for wild animals through TV movies various educational opportunities for example the Dane County Humane Society has a humane education program teaching people to respect and appreciate animals companion and wild and lastly I feel that this bill is quite conservative in nature and we could even take a stronger approach to prohibit additional species so again I ask that you choose to be on the right side of history with this issue and vote YES with Wisconsin being one of five states left with little to no legislation we have a long-awaited chance to do the right thing our society has exploited while the animals for far too long and I know we can do better testimonia gee I appreciate the intent here and what you're trying to do I do want to go on record as correcting one thing that is that you can just go online and with one-click order an elevator and it's not illegal that currently is illegal to do in Wisconsin and let me redo the Wisconsin Legislature under current law the buying selling in possession of non-native animals such as lions tigers and elephants is not permitted prohibited by state law unless the animals endangered or threatened species are included listing harmful by of wild animals so what this bill cuts gonna let me keep going with certain exceptions a person may not possess take propagate self purchase transfer exhibit or rehabilitate a wild animal without specific authorization by the DNR so what this bill is doing is it's prohibiting the DNR from regulating the sale and the process of obtaining exotic animals and instead we're defining in statute that this would these animals would be why so I guess my question is then do you believe the DNR is not doing a sufficient job in regulating the sale distribution and possession of exotic animals well I'll speak honestly in to the fact that I'm not familiar with the the laws and regards to alligators in Wisconsin I mean alligators I know them but Ella gays are not native to Wisconsin so I don't know it would be illegal to possess a non-native species sure the approval and I would then I would say yes I DNR's able to manage that's what we're looking at today right we should regulate it through state statute opposes the DNR rank the body arrest sure absolutely and I agree and but on this particular website in fact it's using your documentation from me it says that in Wisconsin states and a copy of a proper license much must be furnished to us prior to shipment Wisconsin is not on this list of states that needs a proper license state regulates native or non-native animals like lions tigers those exceptions are for endangered or threatened species and for harmful wild animals which is a fine term and it generally includes bears Cougars feral hogs mute swans and wolfdog hybrids with it's a very limited set of harmful so so they're our most exotic animals are are not currently regulated by the state law so there are is pallies that in regulates animals within their their districts was pointed up before by represent the bill eliminates this ability of DNR to regulate harmful wild animals that select group instead replaces that with this new scheme that's put forth by the bill that generally prohibits their possession unless you are one of a certain number of groups or if you currently have one and you register that animal with the order can I just ask a question on that so in the pledge consonant memo it says with certain exceptions that person may not possess to take propagate sell purchase transfer exhibit rehabilitate harmful wild animal without specific authorization by the DNR at what point then does the DNR authorize people to disaster by animals you know how to talk my head I can't remember exactly the images any rate over the exceptions and that's just for these harmful wild animals which as I pointed out is a very small group it's certain bears feral hogs nice ones and wolfdog hybrids saudis when i what it says harmful wild land well it's just refer to those select ones and there's a process for DNR authorization for I just want to make sure that everything is ironed out we know what we're doing here and we're not just saying myth you know dangerous wild animals easy regulated more efficiently we're not exactly sure how that regulation is taking place I think we need to hone in on how exactly where we plan to regulate this and make sure it's appropriate response sorry I forget you mentioned that you would add to that list well in my experience species that I think are exploited wolves parrot type species dangerous snake those are ones that I think are taking the most advantage of in our society but there are million save millions hundreds of other animals really that I don't think captivity next up would be mark Schabel from the score Oh animal entertainment speaking in favor with amendments mark no mark just I will come back time maybe if I could just clarify one more quick point when I said it eliminates the DNR's treatment of harmful wild animals I mean that only for exotic wild animals not not exotic cells to be continued to be treated the same as the under current laws so it's for example bears are harmful wild animals it only be exotic bears that would be treated under this law and close by the bill non exotic Terriers are native bears the continued being treated the same as the whose non-native considered exotic yes good I will move on then to Ryan McVeigh from Madison speaking against morning yeah yeah a little bit working it all right again thank you for taking the time to hear everyone my name is Ryan McVeigh I'm the president and founder the Madison area Herpetological Society we work throughout Madison to get to schools get on community and educate them about reptiles and amphibians so my focus today I kind of ask everybody as I'm talking shake out of your head tigers and lions I'm not concerned with them whatsoever I don't know a lot about tigers and lions and I'm not speaking towards them what I'm speaking towards is the crocodilians and so I've got kind of a lot safe so hopefully you guys come kind of bear with me although as quick as I can super get out here but while these animals may not seem as pets a lot of people have a real connection with them and when speaking about the contact that we've all had everybody's been talking about their I can attest firsthand there is a huge huge difference between having a kid read a book watch a show get interested in crocodilians and actually going up and touching one many of you have probably have pets of been around pets the there's there studies that show how much calmer you are when you're petting your dog when you're because you make a connection with an animal and you care about that animal zoos do a great job to bring those animals in front of people but that contact it does something with people it gives us that that emotional connection to that animal and we care and when it comes to conservation that's unbelievably important I can't get kids to care about reading a book because unless it's an iBook and it's on their phone you know and you can't get people to care about something unless they become we attach to it and that's where you get them to to care about this animal to teach them about it why it's important why it's conservation is important so when Wisconsin there's never been a death to do to a crocodilian in the past 24 years there have only been four incidents in Wisconsin dealing with any animal included Navis 333 including no deaths so it's kind of making a law for something that doesn't exist and I understand the concern but when it comes to crocodilians there's never nothing's ever happened and we're making a lot to restrict something that's never happened looking at other states that have created more strict laws such as Ohio they've caused a worse problem with animals without homes and millions of dollars in cost to taxpayers that are severely higher than the cost of any incidents that may have happened including a 2.9 million dollar holding facility for large exotic animals that Ohio may never even use more recently States us as West Virginia Illinois have removed crocodilians from their proposed banned or implemented permit system similar to what we are proposing today in the back of this I proposed an amendment that I hope everybody gets a chance to look at this permit system allows for educational organizations and keepers with the means to properly house these animals to continue to do so while keeping them out of the hands of irresponsible keepers and animal welfare situations and I think that's got to be the main goal of something like this is not to just ban everything and get rid of it but to the people who are taking the steps to keep these animals humanely and a good and healthy and put in the public safety aspects to contain them should be able to continue to do so however people who aren't doing it when you find a baboon in someone's basement in a bathroom those people should be held accountable and shouldn't be able to handle those animals so at the present as president of an educational organization I lectured a lot of Madison colleges including uw-madison vet school Globe University Madison College as well as many K through 12 schools community groups and public events and this bill as written limits my ability to educate people about certain species such as crocodilians in the wild there are exemptions in here for it credited zoos and other facilities so like USDA has a good example so if I get there's no licensing for reptiles there's no USDA licensing for reptiles that only involves mammals so for me to get to be able to keep a crocodilian I first have to get a monkey and then get the USDA accreditation to keep the monkey so I can keep the Crockett I don't want a monkey I like to keep my little crocodilly and I don't want to have to do that there's nothing else in there being an educator and using this to educate kids that takes away my ability to do that and there's nothing in here that even though I care for them properly I've cared for hundreds probably close to thousands of reptiles throughout my lifetime and worked with conservation organizations actually my bracelets from raising money for crocodilians from croc fest thank Canada and it takes away my ability to do that and one thing to think about too with crocodilians while trying to restrain an angry large lion or tiger is very difficult I'd assume I have never tried and I don't want to I'm not dealing with them crocodilians up to one meter snout vent which is from the tip of their nose to right at the bottle their tail are very easy to handle and to control even actually actually even crocodilians like saltwater crocodiles up to 15 feet you can hold their mouth shot with one hand they have extreme bite power coming down but they have very weak jaws to be able to open them once a small crocodilly enough to say again one meter sodon't vent it has its mouth taped shut it can't do anything other than scratch you if it's flailing around and it's very easy to control and keep from having some type of incident so in the amendment that I brought forward I'd like to have it looked at to be any any crocodilian under one meter so now and not be regulated just because again it's not an animal that poses a severe harm to the public as well as things like thoughts with escapes they can't right now crocodile and lake monona is a popsicle so they can't live the closest that an American alligator gets to us is not even to the southern tip of Illinois so they can't live here so any escapes like that the weather takes care of it and again if small animals like the small crocodilians like that don't pose as large of a threat as again more that the Milwaukee lion could have in captivity another thing too that makes a big difference with crocodilians crocodilians have a very different biologies and mammals in captivity they typically grow very slowly and it's a natural occurrence because of the biology of crocodilians its entire different it's entirely different than mammalian biology it's been shown that even in the wild in North Carolina one of the northernmost States to have native crocodilians which is the American alligator it takes 18 years for one of them to reach 6 feet this is an in Florida it might take five but it's up depending on the situations that they live in currently at the wildlife Discovery centers is a zoo in Lake Forest Illinois there is a three foot I think it's 12 year old saltwater crocodile it's a saltwater crocodile you saw Steve Irwin jump on it's like 12 years old it's this big just because of the way that it lives in the wood and the way that it's kept a complete ban is an overreach of legislation it's completely unreasonable in my eyes many other states such as Illinois and Indiana have specific regulations and and only require a permit and specific secure caging for crocodilian five feet and longer which I agree with attach this is an amendment this amendment was written in cooperation with input and expertise from the United States Association of reptile keepers the Madison area Herpetological Society and dr. Brady Barr and his wife may Lynn Sanchez bar for those you don't know Brady bar is a member of the endangered species coalition of the Council of state governments and the International crocodilians specialist group it also serves as a scientist expert for the International Union of Conservation of Nature and Mei Lin is a marine biologist and educator who runs an eco program for kids including many crocodilians Mei Lin is actually also the aza s crocodilian advisory groups education liaison and member of the property crocodilian specialist group so this is someone that's on an AZ a group that that so helped us to write this this amendment from the crocodile this is from the crocodilian advisory group a website the crocodilian advisory group is the association of zoo and aquariums for first and oldest taxon advisory group sanctioned by the ACS World Conservation Monitoring Centre in 1986 this elite group of zoos and aquariums and aquarium professionals specializes in captive management education and conservation of the world's crocodilian species and provides their expertise in husbandry breeding educational programs and captive management for zoos and aquariums worldwide captive breeding can be a powerful conservation tool for critically endangered species our greatest challenge to date has been the marshalling of necessary space and resources for the captive management of imperiled crocodilian species cognizant of this situation the CAG feels compelled to redirect its attention and include a more focus on education the prompt promotion of institute conservation efforts that kind of reads right to what we do as the Madison area logical society trying to get out there and reach education zoos do a great job with conservation captive breeding programs but there's not enough zoos to save every animal there's just not and a lot of them don't have the funding everybody who's been deaf Henry Vilas Zoo and has been involved with it knows that they're always trying to find ways to get funding and continue to keep that zoo around there to diversify those different species that need help need to be protected private individuals that do that in a manner that's in line with the animals well-being can provide that extra help I've bred endangered frogs that other zoos that zoos haven't been able to focus on because a frog this big doesn't help bring in money to help them to conserve other animals but I've been able to do that in my home and it'll work with certain zoos and things like that to continue a captive breeding program that there are an enormous amount of animals that wouldn't be around today and wouldn't be in captivity without the private sectors probably a breeding so this amendment of remove removes crop it also removes crocodilians from the same section as the other animals and like to put them in a different section again because they're completely to compare an alligator to a tiger is apples and oranges in their biology their care their husbandry their danger of them everything so and again it can also be easily be restrained by taping their mouth shut which makes it completely safe for the public for me to hold an anti small crocodilian and have someone come up and pet it it also changes again we've talked about change I've talked about changing the ban to not include any animal that's one a meter or less note by at length I'd like to bring up a few things to nail a they talked about confiscation when it comes to crocodilians and a lot of exotic animals once they're caught for confiscated they don't go to some pretty sanctuary they're slaughtered they're killed they're not euthanize they're not sick they're killed a lot of times with things like this that could be they can be in a very good home well cared for and then once they're told that once they're they're made they're banned then they're pulled out of that good home and killed just for the region that the reason of a legislation also we somebody brought up the Dane County Humane Society's Wildlife Program they get their wildlife talks from me and herb society so we're the ones that come in and bring them reptiles and get the kids interacted this is again another thing that we do with it no one else does and without that ability to do that it taking something away from us and one last thing that I wanted to touch on is there's a there's been a lot and talk about a za and za a and who does what there's there's people and there's a lot of people in the room they have a lot of different things going on with lobbying we're a nonprofit group I don't not lobbying I'm speaking for the people that actually own these animals that are part of this organization that go out with me every weekend and don't see and bring my kids and educate people and pass on that passion for animals and there's also a big difference between what's been said with animal welfare groups and animal rights groups and I think everybody needs to be aware of animal welfare groups are groups like the Dane County Humane Society and organizations like ours that educate people on how to better care for their animals how to if we care about the animals well-being in longevity animal rights groups are also groups that exist that hide behind that animal welfare type of a thing there their main goal is to pull every single animal out of captivity all the way down to dogs and cats so that's just something to be aware of that there is a difference and and again words I'm speaking as someone who cares about the animals care their husbandry their long life and people's passion to be able to interact with them and want to save them in the wild another thing to point out too is conservation doesn't just happen in the wild there's a lot of places where they're this magical idea that we need to keep these animals in the wild isn't a Disney movie there isn't a wild anymore I work with Borneo earless monitors their entire range is now palm tree or palm oil farms they're gone we can conserve that animal in the wild it's there is no wild they're gonna go extinct because they can't be brought into captivity and put into private brenta into breeding programs they'll go extinct from trying to conserve them so there's things like that to keep in mind as well currently what also talking like 10 frogs this big in a tank that's built like a rainforest so this isn't 140 giant crocodilians I currently don't own any I have owned them in the past but currently I don't own any we had a small little baby caiman that we named Carlton and he went everywhere with us and educated and kids loved him he would turkey ever ever heard him like call for their mom and Mark super cute and he was like that big he passed away and we haven't replaced him just because currently I'm looking at potentially moving so I'm waiting to get into a new house to build a better enclosure okay so you did say and just got a couple more that you are a member of the ACA or no nope I can't get a za I'm I don't have a facility yeah so nobody is your own for instance in the city wok yep right there if I want more than three dogs and three cats which I would never want that I have to get a special license do you with a lot of times reptiles there is they're not usually thought of like that and a lot of big reason is and and this brings up a good point when I say I have a hundred and forty animals the first thing everyone thinks is a house full of 140 dogs that's not the case that's wild it's like it's like saying I have a hundred and fifty fish if I have six fish tanks full of fish no one cares because they're contained in tank they can't live outside of the tank and it's a lot of times the same thing with reptiles they're contained in an enclosure excuse me they can't live outside the enclosure for or for long any exotic reptile can't live outside for more than one day at 55 degrees without getting respiratory infection in dying and a lot of times with numbers and things like that a lot of these snakes that I own live in very small enclosures snakes aren't again reptiles aren't like mammals they don't need to go out and run ball pythons are a good example they're very common in the pet trade in the wild they go into a burrow eat the inhabitant and they live in a hole this big 22 of the 24 hours of the day and only come out to eat or drink so a snake is actually more comfortable in a very small enclosure where they don't feel like something's gonna come on sky to eat them so while I say I have a lot they're all in basically one room other than some of the rainforest enclosures and that I've built to look really nice to be part of our living room and you would have to give up no no right now was it is it only covered it only covers the crocodilians no other reptiles which I only which I'd like to keep it we've dealt with other bills and things like that in the past with local municipalities where it just like so what it said it it what a Dane County tried to wear what looked at passing a bill a few years ago that would have made everything that you've ever owned illegal even goldfish and minnows so right now this is directly at crocodilians right now nothing I own would become illegal because I don't own any crocodilian right now again though I would like to have one for our educational purposes and if this bill came into passed before I moved I wouldn't be able to learn I wouldn't be able to go on and there's no exemption for educational again because I can't become an aza accredited facility for them it's my house I can't become CA accredited I can't get USDA accredited because there's no such thing for reptiles unless I get a mammal get accredited and then have it which I don't want to do furry things are food for reptiles anyway in this room want to see healthy you know animals or reptiles put to death I mean I don't think that's anybody in school but I do want to ask you about something you did say in your written testimony here about the unity of the United States mean animal rights group which is correct but do you have anything that I mean I have a look to discern and I don't agree with you because I've worked with both the United States seaweed society and my local you know you may be exciting but I do have a look to join with you with your comment about you know there your role is to protect you from human contact all animals we first include burns yeah it's on their website you can dig it into it you can dig it too and find that you can find that on their website if you take it into it um if you go to Humane watch.org that actually pulls off a lot of it including it's in their taxes and their tax forms they're basically an animal rights group so that's equivalent to PETA they're just not as extreme with burning down buildings but they work in the same when it comes to legislation really because it's called the Humane Society so you assume that it's an umbrella corporation this is another point to bring up Shana asked to talk about the HS yeah but the Midwest legislative conference of the civil and state governments just passed a resolution to investigate them for fraud for fraudulent fundraising so that's another thing you can look into if you'd like in one section it says the person authorized to possess a crocodilian may transfer detrack ability for another person who's legally authorized to Cartman have you defined in this amendment somewhere then that comes into the permit that's already in the bill there's one thing that got kind of sort of missed with this if I own I own a crocodilian and I'm grandfathered in and I get the permit that's needed to keep that and for some reason I'm no longer able in my eyes to keep him properly there's nothing for me to do with it because someone who doesn't have a permit can't take it because they aren't grandfathered in so you'd have to transfer it to someone else who was already grandfathered and had the permit but they can't obtain a new animal so this kind of is just saying if they have a current permit that they can take in an animal otherwise if there's no more welfare situations if that happens there's nowhere for it to go sure in the registration section remember that it wouldn't be a person that would be registered possessive crocodilian it would be each you would advocate for each crocodilian being registered with a municipality it'd be like a dog if you have three dogs you have to register those three dogs so with the crocodilians if you had two crocodilians like such as with the with some of the crops with the crocodilian I have in mind that I'd like to work with to keep Iran for their for educational purposes is very small and dangered species I would like to get a pair and build office and build an enclosure and work on actively breeding them that in that regard I'd have to register them twice sure each one my only other one is can you elaborate or help me find it all for doing this amendment what a bona fide educational program that would be I think they might need to tighten up that language in terms of just bonafide and having some yeah it's it's difficult that's something that's difficult there's really not anything out there right now that defines what an educational program is well we tried to write in with this is that they have proof that they've gone out and done an educational event at least twice a year and I'd be happy to work with anyone on this amendment this is just an idea this is where we'd like to see it go and I'd be happy to work on making that more strict in a way that makes sense and I can lend that backpack that aspect of what we do and how to make it so that you know Bob that wants an alligator can't just say oh I do education yeah so and I would like to make that more strict again I'm I'm not against having crocodilians having to be registered to be honest I'd rather see them have to be registered I'd rather see some type of oversight to some of them so that we don't end up with in sheboygan the one that ended up in a in a gutter or something I there needs to be more to stop that from happening and I think I was hoping that registration would do that a lot of times it's alligators that you see that way because they're brought in and they're very cheap other animals like payment thinks her mentioned like came in some Caymans are five hundred dollars a baby not many people just get that on a whim so I'd love to I would like to work more than to make this work better for everyone and like I said it the whole goal is to just not take away the ability for a proper keeper to keep that animal if it's being helped health health leads and safely and make it so the people who aren't doing that are are prosecuted or lose that right and ability to keep that innovation than it is a question many times have been Bronner of Education of the alligator's we have a small village in my district that leon wisconsin that they do a gator fest every year and that was because about 12 to 15 years ago there was an article in one of the major US magazines that said there's an alligator infestation and leon wisconsin may be on called call the paper magazine and said what do you mean leon wisconsin don't you know where we are well it was supposed to be leon florida to change the next time you have that you saw stuff I'd love to come up and just waste manuals of my soap can my education coordinators listening so we better put that on um it's you have anyone interested in introducing your a minute ah we haven't yet I'm looking for someone to be interested introducing it I I think it's a it's a fair amendment and I'm I'm hoping to find some support for it so far it's just me putting it out there as this is something there are a lot of people in Wisconsin to keep reptiles one in 11 households keeps reptiles it's a fastest growing section of the pet industry and a big part of that is because they're easy to contain in a small enclosure they're hypoallergenic it's it's an it's an it's something that you have to learn about you can get any type of dog in it's the same type of care but two different type of geckos keep different you get to see different care so sorry but so there's a lot of people in the state that have these animals and just are afraid to come out and say anything so it's hard to get supports by one of the people here and I see that you chose compliance with the guidelines for the aza but you don't that was just a misstep on that I would support either I've seen zoos from both I know the political background behind why one slams the other it's money that's all it is they're both again they're both similar and they're both they both accredit like the the person had said the same zoos are accredited by both from what I've seen from the CAA as I watched it it a Z aid has a think that he said has a lot more in-depth stuff dealing with the financial aspects of gift shops and running the zoo as a business whereas the CAA focuses more on the animals and less about the financial aspects of it making sure that the animal husbandry is taken care of that would have just been something that was left out but I would support having Melanie Weber from Osceola that's finding Bayer all right good morning my name is Melanie Weber can you hear me I am here to support ad 333 as originally introduced with no amendments and to preserve in capital letters the ban on public contact which I think think is a huge public safety risk as well I'm wearing two halves Polk County resident Polk counties northwestern Wisconsin for those of you that don't know along the st. Croix River we border Minnesota some here's a Polk County resident and also a member of the League of Women Voters Wisconsin chapter but as a resident of polk county i we live within approximately one and a half hours of the Twin Cities Minnesota and since Minnesota does have regulations for captive exotic animals and Wisconsin does not I'm concerned that Polk County which is a rural county is attractive too when I would consider shady individuals from Minnesota and other states as well who have no regard for public safety public health interest nor the humane treatment of captive exotic animals this summer we had a huge huge I didn't even know was a mile and a half from my house a huge cockfighting ring that was discovered and since then it's been on my mind quite a bit and so when I was preparing what I wanted to say today I did call yesterday in the middle of the day I called the Polk County Sheriff's Office and I asked them about I said I was coming here to make comment on the exotic animal bill a B 333 and could they give to me some information well within two hours did call me back because of the reporting system they have they call it the damn reporting system D AM they couldn't pull out the exotic information they were able to go back to 2007 and he said they had about three I talked to the office staff and the sheriff they had had about 300 animal cases since 2007 he was they were very helpful that made me think that they were in suddenly I took that as they seemed to be very supportive getting the information out there I told them I was in support of it because I'm concerned about captive exotic animals in our rural County they said if they did if we if I do want exact information on exotic animals they be tried to work on that and get that back to me my experience has been with Polk County that they do look to the state oftentimes for leadership or guidance on the issue of captive animals and I think some of the things I wanted to talk about have been said and I don't want to belabor that I think captive exotic animals are a risk to public health that was mentioned you all know about the monkey pox outbreak that originally was from approximately 300 animals 19 different species that were imported that was here in 2003 in Wisconsin 53 people and a child I guess was actually had developed encephalitis from that and also the risk to public health from animal prion diseases I know the summer some buy out there was an eight year research John was published this summer and scrape ease of prion disease had jumped species I think that is a possibility of the risk to wildlife from exotic animals as well I think we know about that I did talk to a veterinarian and biologist and they had said quote one of the dangers is not knowing which diseases our wildlife will be susceptible to she had given me two examples she said currently in the state of Washington they have this exotic louse which is impacting their black tailed deer and their meal deer populations I mean I also mentioned the monkey pox outbreak so it's in to jump to my the other hat the leak of humane voters Wisconsin chapter that I'm a member of the message I just wanted to stay quite simply as we have grave concerns with captive exotic animals being confined in unnatural and oftentimes inhumane conditions with little to no stimulation or exercise one thing I just found publishes the the a LDF the animal League Defense Fund a National Organization just recently announced the publication of their 2015 US animal protection laws rankings report and this was their tenth you're doing that surveys animal protection laws of all US states it reflects examination of over four thousand pages of statutes assessing the strength of each state's animal protection laws they have 15 different 15 different categories of animal protection used to rank in 2014 Wisconsin was ranked 36 in the middle tier and in 2015 this last year Wisconsin dropped to 44th in animal protection the bottom tier out of 50 states and so I think in simply enclosing we believe that Public Safety Public Health go hand in hand with animal protection and feel that a B 333 is a major win for all three seeing done well thank you for your testimony again and we'll call the next witness Jody landovsky speaking in favor my name is Jody Landowski I live in Racine Wisconsin I'm here as a concerned citizen and my love for animals a lot of things have come up with this bill and my biggest thing is obviously the protection of the animals yeah they are danger to human humans normally don't have a good idea of what they're getting into and they get these exotic animals they're kept in horrible condition and these animals don't ask for it they don't want to be kept in cages they don't want to pace around they don't want to get malnourished they don't want to die from diseases that they won't die from in the in the wild and too many people are allowed to have them I mean I shouldn't be able to just go up to some farm and say oh I want that tiger cub thanks I'll give you 300 bucks for it and I get it it's ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous that people are able to do this I'm just incredibly concerned and I want to see it stopped I know there's a lot of people out there that want to use animals for education but they have to look at the stress value of the animal how stressed are these animals when they're used for education these lion cubs and tiger cubs that are used yeah unfortunately once they get baked they end up going to to the meat trade they go to warehouses where they're sent for slaughter and it's unfortunate and I think of a bill was put through where it could stop this from happening these animals wouldn't be put in these circumstances kind of my concern thank you for your testimony are there any questions seeing none thank you that does conclude the speakers in the testimony today however we do have individuals who have registered for or against against cliff Johnson against Bob Welch of Wisconsin bear hunters Association and against Christopher Johnson of Spencer's man registering for we're gonna have to backtrack I gotta fight this stuff we call it twice right there we're gonna backtrack here a minute I believe mr. mark Roble just walked in we called mr. shovel a couple times you weren't here sir but we do want to give you an opportunity to speak if you still wish to this is Mark show both speaking in favor with the amendments apologize I have to step out take care of some business but can you hear me okay yes my name is mark shovel and I have a company called animal entertainments and we've been in business since 1879 and we have halt we've held a USDA license since 1979 there seems to be some misconceptions about USDA license holders that somehow we're not regulated and that were you know we don't have any laws to live under and I just want to set the record straight that's not true we're subjected to unannounced inspections I don't ever recall having a fun time with an inspection but that just is part of the business we've got a good relationship with the USDA we've always tried to comply with their rules and regulations they inspect your property for safety animal care and I think those are those people who say that there are no regulations and the Wisconsin I'd have to take a little objection to that because we do if you are involved in breeding animals exhibiting animals transferring animals any number of topics you're required to have a license under USDA the only exception to that is if you have one as a personal animal that you're keeping we don't we support the bill with some amendments and we live under a license we have for many years and I suspect that it's probably proper that other people if they want the animals you'd probably do the same thing we do supply a lot of it I know there was questions brought up where some of our animals go they go to they've gone to a CA facilities they've gone to za a facilities they go to USDA facilities we don't sell any of our cats or some of our large carnivores as pets that's not what we do we have a park that's opened into open to the public in Wisconsin Dells called Tim Abadi and we have spent a lot of money on building this facility in the last four years some of these animals are very important to us we were heavily involved with the captive wildlife bill for 14 I thought I turned it off okay we're heavily involved with the captive wildlife bill for that are part of 14 years and that passed in 2002 and at that time it was the understanding you know with everybody that bears and cats and stuff we're gonna fall under USDA jurisdiction and that is why the captive wildlife bill was written the way it was we build our businesses you know based on laws and these laws can when you throw every throw them out the door or make major law changes they can be very detrimental to a person's business and be very detrimental to the animals in the case of bears when they pass the captive wildlife bill a lot of those animals died and it's unfortunate it didn't have to go that way sometimes they were very they up the regulations on pen specs and that was which is fine we complied and we've always tried to comply with animal care taking care of our animals we do do photos with our young animals and we have a very strict policy you know how we handle them and we usually run these animals up to about 40 or 50 pounds they're a very important part of our business they do provide a lot of people with an opportunity to get close to them and have a personal experience we don't encourage pets we don't sell pets and that's not what we do these animals are part of a way for funding our operation and we think that probably people should have a license for some of them I heard a lot of testimony here on the big difference between a za and za a and I can tell you that most municipalities in the state of Wisconsin will never belong to the ACA unless major investments are made a za is not open to everybody they don't want everybody in their organization za a was started up because they were shut out and a CA doesn't want those people and that's the reason is CAA has started up it's a great organization I was at their meeting in Las Vegas about two months ago very informative they have great seminars there people that provide products we just recently built a new penguin pet aquarium and when we got down there when we walked in the door there was two vendors there and everything I need it from the glass to the pumps the filters so if you think Z a a is a substandard or USDA is substandard I gotta take objection to it I think that you we if you're gonna give all these other organizations exemptions you have to look at us and it's not right to throw people out the door like that USDA holders and exhibitors I'm a dealer an exhibitor and we provide animals to circus world parade we've provided animals for movies entertainment aza facilities EAA facilities municipal facilities where been and highly very very much involved with it for better part of 40 years and I could say my entire life my father had the fur and feather game farm at El Dorado when I was a child and so I've literally been involved with this since but since I was a child it's a somehow feel like I'm sitting on a little bit of a hot seat here I think there's I know there's people in this room that like to put us out of business I'd like to clear up one other thing when it comes to USDA citations I think the word citation is thrown around pretty loosely because when people come when the inspectors come to your facility their citations to me means something else you have inspection reports and they find compliant items that you have to be that they'll go around and and they'll list your compliant items or non-compliant items and that's not a citation those are non-compliant items and there's somebody will say well they had 50 citations well I don't know that 50 50 non-compliant items I'll tell you it would be an extremely lot you know and there's probably something more going on if you had 59 compliant items and I don't know some of the situations that they're talking about but we take a lot of pride in our our animal collection we have a very nice animal collection and we we support the bill with the amendment are there any questions for mr. mr. shovel okay representative Pope not necessarily a question for you but more for alleged counsel could the committee be provided with regulations guidelines whatever from the USDA that's another entity that's been mentioned frequently today where I don't understand USDA licenses licenses and a little bit about how they're regulated they don't ACA doesn't want those people and that's created the CAA I don't understand what the implication was when you said the ACA doesn't want those people and so it's true they're there they're not office they're not an organization that accepts everybody into the organization it's a very close tight-knit organization and if you look at the number if you look at the number of aza facilities in this country it really hasn't grown accredited facilities it really hasn't growing much and you know where do people go when they they want help or need knowledge and I'm unfortunately you know a lot of people they don't want a lot of people in their organization their public institution they have different goals they take funding you know they take millions and millions of dollars in funding and so they you know that's their little world and that's fine but I we know it's not right that a facility that has that much money coming in dictate the terms if you lock everybody out you're almost well you know guaranteeing a monopoly and it's it's pretty well accepted among the industry but they are an elitist organizations trouble what's that I'm not in the industry and I'm trying to understand this better in there but you seem to be implying is that the ACA is more an elitist organization funded by public dollars where the CAA is opened up to other organizations so you're saying there's no difference in their standards I'm not saying that there's differences standards they have their own they have their own agenda they have their own you know what they want to achieve and what they do and it doesn't always you know there's there's many different ways of running a business and operation we're not funded by the public we're funded by hard work you know and dedication and and the CAA has got a lot of private members that would never won't get into the ACA going back probably 25 years ago ACA kick most of the private members out and I believe there's only one registered dealer in Aza I I don't mean to put you on the defense I'm just struggling as vote on this bill at some point I presume to understand what the differences are in Wisconsin you have Green Bay you have ever seen we have Milwaukee and Madison and I think maybe the crane foundation in in Baraboo Raz eight members and at one time there was a Wisconsin zoo associates that had the private members and all the municipalities including the carv including Milwaukee and Madison they were all the members of the Wisconsin zoo associates and now you know those large organizations are not a member of Wisconsin Zoo or associates and don't wanna be some of the municipalities you have Oshkosh and Manitowoc in Chippewa Falls we supplied parks with those animals I recently this fall built the Interior pens and gates for the Kodiak bears in Marshville zoo we have a very nice workshop metal shop fabricating shop we have trucks and trailers where we're a company that transports handles moves animals and I don't know if I'm helping to explain the difference between a Z and Z AAA but we're all licensed by the USDA everybody's got an inspection and if anybody if any zoo comes and says that they've never had an AZ a facility never had any non-compliant items I would have to take exception to that because I believe that most everybody gets non compliant items yeah a lot we get that we have wrote we do road shows we get inspected on the road we can inspect it at our part we get expected at our site off-site facilities you know maybe six seven times a year about the different different locations thank you we have representative sannie key and then thank you with sure Harbhajan Pope really pretty much addressed my my question my issue and you know I just went came into the ceiling in this was for non-controversial bill really hidden suddenly it has turned extremely controversial and it's I'm just trying to wrap my head around some of the discussion that we've had here today but so we've heard from a representative from ze is there anybody here from easy don't you talk to privately your ease of information I'm kind of curious to know what facilities in Wisconsin are easy milwaukee madison Racine and Green Bay just does is is that's to my Aza I think the crane foundation is also I'm not aware of any other ones I know the other municipal zoos Manitowoc the medium-sized cities are not I mean you did say we would easy a it operates pretty much as a private tiny club you know I'm just trying to talk this I know all that catwalk you tell me sir there was an issue few years ago with their accreditation for the devil for the elephants and it was the easy a that you need to do this and what do elephants so different level of standards that we're looking at here sure there's a I'm just trying to wrap my head around it's fine it's covered under USDA license I do have a seat license because it helps my reading of the ability to see licenses the exhibitor under the federal handle Welfare Act you circus yeah if somebody has a seat license as an exhibitor under the federal animal welfare hat would they be classified as a circus and use them I can answer that question yeah I see licenses for exhibiting whether it's traveling roadshows or you have a private stationary set up sure B is for breeding you know supplying and it depends upon how much of your income comes either way we have our farm place that says be and our Zoo is license SS C operation you would need the additional protections under the amendment of being exempt as having a license from the US Department of Agriculture I'm just trying to figure out if you currently would be classified if it was a USDA license I believe a pianist II both should be exempt we have you have situations where the small municipal parks rely on our company to move animals in and out you know we supply animals Chippewa Falls sublime with zebras and we've got Tigers up there and we've you know we've got a lot of different types of animals up there and you know you put our entire hands behind our back what are they gonna do where are they gonna go with the animals who do they get the animals from it's not the you know people have do you know fuzzy ideas about and a lot of how the operate out of the animal world works but you know the animal business is highly regulated releases by the DNR relations by the USDA and as far as the issue the situation with the bears I believe that language in there says hon bears uh you know DNR control is ersity that correct I just later doesn't get around the picture do you currently analyzing pollutant UNR yes captain wild animal farm licenses - I also I also would like to comment on the USDA license hold you know just the comment was that USDA just give you automatically gives you a license it's not really that simple you do have to tell your form you do have to fill out your reports and you have to turn them in every year I guarantee if you're two minutes late you won't have a license they're very strict on the license they give you no time lapse at all your license is supposed to be send it in and if it's not there by the due date start over [Music] [Laughter] so you talk about like the sea lights and then it's like a gravity correct well no see license can be traveling or station I find I provide you know a variety of animals and stuff first I prefer not in my district outside my district that does a lot of shows in my district petting zoo indeed but they would she leave with their animals in parades you know in order to do that technically they have to have a USDA license yes unless it's farm animals verbs are exotic well they're in no exotic than they have to have USDA license and we can they do that does complete testimony however I'm gonna go back and read both the fours and against for devotion register yeah so here we go registering for in favor of joist clubs are doing Jolene cloud sorry Wisconsin towns Association registering for Jean wheeler special memories zoo registering for Gretchen Gretchen Crowe special memories zoo and registering for Kurt wood with tip ski League of Wisconsin municipalities and so those registering against Bob Welch Wisconsin bear hunters Association cliff Johnson from Spencer Wisconsin registering against Christopher Johnson also from Spencer Wisconsin I'm cliff and Christopher we would be for the bill with okay thank you okay then that then we'll have to cry together over there with that I think that concludes this bill and let's move on to the next one which is Assembly Bill 610 and I believe we have a representative from we have senator vanguard back here with us and and representative how are you today you want to start you don't [Music] why don't we proceed whenever you're ready good morning chairman Heaton and committee members before I begin I have to respectfully excuse after my testimony I have another committee hearing I have to be at in a deliberate testimony there as well so it when I'm done I will excuse myself and return to our committee after that Thank You chairman Hayden and members of the assembly Committee on consumer protection we're holding a hearing on Assembly Bill 610 today as the author of this legislation along with Senator Juan guard I'm pleased to testify before you and to take any questions that committee members may have Assembly Bill 610 would allow courts to impose a more fitting penalty for prime crimes against the elderly or disabled at the request of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture trade and consumer protection this legislation will add specific crimes to the already existing list of conditions under which a court may impose such as supplemental forfeiture currently the law allows penalty enhancers for some crimes perpetrated against the elderly or disabled already but not including laws relating to the following future service plans rental vehicles self-service storage facility timeshares foreclosure consultants price notices mail order sales unfair billing vehicle protection product warranties video subscriber rights solicitations of public record fees contract solicitations using checks or money orders telephone Scylla tations telephone records consumer loan information tax preparer client information and residential contractors under certain conditions the bill will allow a court to impose a supplement forfeiture for violations of the foregoing that are perpetrated against the elderly or disabled this will help protect and shield Wisconsin's most vulnerable citizens in closing I ask that you join senator Weingarten myself in support of this legislation thank you for your opportunity to testify here today and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have after the Senators testimony well thank you again for allowing us to visit your committee there this morning I'm going to kind of paraphrase my testimony because represent Vandermeer has covered the I think content of what we're trying to do here most you know my law enforcement experience of 30 years in law enforcement in dealing with some of the issues that we're trying to cover in the bill and of course the spill is important to me because I am approaching senior citizen age and who knows if somebody calls me and it sounds like it's a really good deal but it's not because maybe I'm not thinking as clearly once I get to be 80 or 85 you know I'm not picking on 80 or 85 year olds but I know how how difficult it can be to understand the complexity of some of these these offers that are being made by oh one get one for 50% off the second one so you think it's you're buying one and as a Half Price it's not so I mean when we look at what we're bringing forward here the criminals are preying on on senior citizens and we know that this has become a target of opportunity for our criminals today and especially when we have different ways that they can do this and we've covered some of these for the future service plans marketing practices trade practice rental car self-service storage facilities foreclosure consultants etc a lot of those areas of interest are complex and it's easy to baffle somebody that doesn't have a clear understanding and so our seniors become the target this legislation is aiming at putting some teeth into allowing debt cap to be able to enforce forfeitures for organizations groups etc that target senior citizens and I believe it's a $10,000 yes forfeiture that we have up to ten thousand up to ten thousand dollars and that's per incident you may have two or three hundred seniors that are contacted so this could become a very expensive venture if these companies don't follow the rules so this is important legislation I believe to add to the list and give dad cap clarity and what they can do to enforce this to protect the seniors are most vulnerable so I would ask you to join us and supporting this legislation that's like I said it's this is pretty much a pretty easy call should be be bipartisan it's going to update our new laws to reflect these crimes av6 ten will allow them to impose the fines that I think are are in order for these violations and again I thank you for for hearing this important bill so we have very important we talked about putting some teeth into this bill for those who are you know violating against our elderly there is also you know we talked about the fine that would be levied against those that that do do this however that would be payable only after restitution is made to the victim and I think that's very important too and if this goes beyond just elderly this is disabled individuals to us all we encompass that also and that's another area that you know anytime somebody has a vulnerability there's always somebody out there is gonna try to take advantage hopefully this will be a huge deterrent and we have representative cats we already answered elderly energy 60 is their definition of disabled these definitions are the bill is really adding on to a current law scheme these supplementary for teachers so the definitions are already in law they don't need to be in the bill right so an elderly person speech is given at least 6 years of age a disabled person means a person who has an impairment of a physical mental or emotional nature that substantially limits at least one major life activity which is another defined term if you wanted to tell you what the a major life activity means self-care or walking seeing hearing speaking breathing learning performing manual or being able to be able to be gainfully provision you have an impairment that substantially limits one of those major life activities we have any other questions threatens an end of me money thanks bringing this bill up I just have a question on the priority of for restitution I found it interesting that this bill would you would have to pay the restitution before the defendant pays portraitures imposed under this section is there precedent anywhere else in state statute will head or have something similar in which restitution must be paid prior to forfeiture being imposed probably good question for much conselho Sara tracing the current law scheme provides us already for certain statutes if you look at the bail you'll see that the section on priority for restitution that exists currently for certain provisions where courts order in restitution restitution is paid to that person before supplemental forfeiture part is paid again if it's maybe worth noting this is all separate from the actual penalty for the underlying crime itself so there's a penalty for the crime or civil infraction that would apply separately from all of this for these incidents just happens to be those if it's a panel traveler infraction that's committed against an elderly person or disabled person then this other team goes over the top of it it also applies to I think the reasoning other ways we're already in a position where the victims been victimized once already and then to put them last in line specially when they have a disability and they may not have the means to even care for themselves as such and they've just been built out of potentially what their resources are I think it's important that we put them in a priority position for being made whole and and secondly if you're a senior who knows how much more time you have you only have so many weekends in your life you know I like this idea and I think we should maybe look at extending that part for prostitution into other crimes as well like that they katana that concludes oh I'm sorry Lee Hancock yeah yeah Frank and training and supervision protections sorry mr. chairman thank you very much members of the committee happy new year thanks for the opportunity to say a few words in support of 8610 also i would like to thank representative van der Meer and senator Wayne Gardner for their sponsorship of this bill after listening to both of them speak on it I can truncate my remarks even a little bit further you have a copy of the bullet points that we put together and I will reiterate the fact that the elderly population while we don't have the data and maintain the data here in the state level through the FTC our federal partner basically we know that the senior population is continuing to increase and we expect that especially as the boomers are going through that the risks that that they pose or that come their way are going to continue to increase we know that as as data the the center part of the remarks that I was going to be giving you on the bill I think have been pretty much talked through if you want to get into details I did ask Michelle Ryan to come over here she is our Bureau director for consumer protection if you have specific details that I may or may not be able to answer I will defer to her if it's okay with the chair but the last thing I wanted to say was was really the impact on dad cap because there will not be any new enforcement areas the actual workload for dad cap staff will not change so whatever you do were happy with that okay and also the state defines these fines and forfeitures in statute so additional rulemaking will not be necessary so again little to no impact on dad cap which is a good thing so with that said protecting Wisconsin consumers for us at dad cap is mission critical and protection for Wisconsin's most vulnerable population the elderly and the disabled is something that we take as extremely important in passing this bill not to overstate it is just simply a good idea with that Thank You mr. chairman committee if you have any questions I'd be happy to try and entertain them we're gonna ask miss Reiner to come and I thank you for your testimony thank you know if there were no questions oh well then we do have a question hockey represent okay so this an elderly person at home tickets phone call and gets talked into purchasing something they can't afford you don't mean how does it play out that that is found out and and prosecuted I mean isn't it he said she said oh what's what's the mechanism for that so our investigative process has done a number of different ways and one of those is generated from consumer complaints that we receive in writings or even consumer contacts via the phone or email to our agency asking questions about an interaction that they may have experienced and we then take that information and have a database full of the numbers that exist and we're always trying to identify the sources of those calls through our work and through the different information that we're receiving from consumers we have many investigative techniques and access to different law enforcement tools that we use and we partner with the Federal Trade Commission as well as other states because these crimes aren't only happening in the state of Wisconsin especially when we're talking telecommunications practices telemarketing practices they're national and international in nature so if we can build our case using that information we'll refer it to the Department of Justice or district attorney's offices for prosecution and that's when this enhancement penalty or supplemental penalty would come into play because we would then identify all the callers using telephone records and and the witness statements that we have and figure out the age groups there and while some of them are occurring to people under 62 many of them are occurring to individuals over 62 and they would then figure out the appropriate supplemental forfeiture I think both for coming here today because applying end date and for answering our questions you may do it that will conclude the testimony we have no written registers for her against so we will move on to the next bill which is a V 502 and we have represented a Kirkman and representative Taylor here speak in support of the bill my testimony you guys will be coming so [Applause] you have it is it's already Minister office person chairman Keaton members thank you so much for hearing to somebody bail 502 the liquid nicotine bill representative Taylor and I have come together to put forth the common-sense bipartisan piece of legislation aimed at protecting the public by regulating liquid nicotine packaging in recent years electronic cigarettes have become very popular alternative to traditional cigarettes the FDA defines electronic cigarettes as products designed to deliver nicotine or other substance to a user in a form of a vapor these devices continue heating elements in a cartridge for the substance often nicotine cigarettes are in a closed or open system closed systems are similar to this kind of a system it's a closed system which is sealed by the manufacturer not intended to be opened by the consumer open systems are similar on this but are refillable and used that substance usually or substance similar to that you pour it into that container these products are ready and available on the open market however they are not regulated it is important to note that a teaspoon of diluted nicotine can poison a child this is a this is actually how much fluid kill a child liquid nicotine one local supplier boasts on its website that one in 15 millimeter bottle of liquid nicotine is equivalent to one carton of traditional cigarette cigarettes or look to a different way one bottle can potentially kill 3 children therefore it's important to regulate these items so that the potential dud is minimized ad 502 provides needed regulation for liquid nicotine in an open system that requires the Department a trade and consumer protection to promulgate rules requiring special child-resistant packaging for open systems of liquid nicotine child restraint packaging is defined which packaging that cannot be opened under a child of age 5 a be bypassing ad 502 Wisconsin would join 18 other states who have enacted this legislation so thank you today for taking the time to hear somebody bill 502 and I am optimistic that myself and representative Taylor and join us in supporting this piece of legislation so again thank you so much and well thank you so much Sharon Heenan thank you community members and thank you represent Kirkman we have learned a lot working on this bill this bill really is about protecting kids I mean that's really the bottom line this liquid nicotine is toxic it's a toxic substance it can kill a child and it has it killed an 18 month old child and there's been many many instances of poisoning from liquid nicotine even getting this on your skin is going to burn you it's very good I'm not going to open this because I don't want it to get anywhere but these containers are very very easy to open any three-year-old trial is going to figure out how to open this and these containers are in kid attractive packaging this one has a monkey on it with bananas they come in gummy bear flavoring they come in pink bubblegum lemonade with very bright packaging it's very attracted to a child very attractive to a child and so that's really our concern we're not talking about these kinds of packaging as Weber sent Kirkman said they're closed you can't get in them it's more this open type of packaging that is really really deadly to a child and we're seeing that other states have passed these laws this is really simple just requires basically child safety packaging Arkansas has passed a law like this Wyoming really across the board red states blue states have passed these laws because really at the end of the day we all want to protect kids and we don't want any child to die from getting just a tiny bit of the toxic substance in their system so I'm happy to answer any questions we do have a really um pretty broad support from the bill both Democrats and Republicans so we're very optimistic about it and we really think it's a it will be a very good piece of policy to have in our state and I just want to add one other thing I mean Chris came forward with the idea and I was talking about it my girlfriend who's actually bought the system the closed system for her parents to try to get them to move off of the traditional cigarettes and in that research found it told me that you know nicotine deceivin getting a small amount can be just very very harmful to your system so that the teaspoon could kill and poison a child to death but a small amount you know is just as hazardous and so that's really why I want to you know to work with Chris when when when this bill will be outdated dia came forward thank you very much any questions thank you very much mr. chair um so just the bill address where does will be displayed in stores obviously get small like cigarettes right it's just the packaging that would be another interesting bill however because a lot of the tobacco that might be something you all want to consider a lot of these tobacco products that aren't cigarettes but they're chewing there they look like bubble gum they're all in front of the counter and they're really designed to appeal to kids which is very disturbing so we don't address that this really addresses the packaging we thought that was the most critical piece but there certainly are other issues with all of these tobacco products that are targeted really at kids could the Department and on the typically and our something that's been yeah it's a good idea you guys should do thank you the first part of this bill is pretty clear to me if you just elaborate on the part of it that also requires these rules to meet the specifications and follow the testing methods for special packaging provided under federal regulations sure okay so we didn't want to create two potentially two sets of rules because at some point the feds are gonna rank it like this I think it's a matter of time they do there's a lot of toxic substances that are regulated at the federal level and usually it's a specific testing protocol so what this follows is basically the federal testing protocols which says that you have to demonstrate in order to be a childproof thing it's child resistant effectiveness of not less than 85 percent so they test on kids basically and see what percentage of kids can open these things and so we're just adopting that standard we have worked with some of the tobacco producers companies who much preferred that there be one standard and does not create separate state standard and then there be a separate federal standard so that's it's really trying to make it easy while really addressing the guts of the problem which is this actually this container the manufacturer says this is childproof any three-year-old can open s you basically just turn it and it opens but they're saying this is safety a safety container because it's not there's no standards that are used so we're just taking the standards that are currently being used thank you at that point order those ours these statues change if the federal testing changes that they adopt the 95% if they adopt a different type of test will are a lot follow with that state statute or a rule locked into that it should follow and that's what the bill basically says is that dad can't pass you all are giving the legislature is giving authority of dad cap to promulgate rules that reflect that federal standard and we thought that made sense it made it a little easier we thought for the manufacturers they always want one standard and the Fed standard is good I mean this is you know a good testing protocol we thought just to make sure kids don't get it so it would follow and I don't know if ledge council wants to address that too but I think it's manufacturers moving to a locked-in mechanism or do you just fix this with just something to be more childproof twist-off well a lot of drugs do have the childproof twist off it's a lot harder than this I mean I would pass this around for anyone I want anyone to get this on their skin I don't want to open it but you will see this is basically a twist off you know any kind of even aspirin I mean it's much harder to get open than this ball you know any really any toddlers gonna figure this out it's very easy to open and we were actually shocked you know because today there's safety but you twist this off and it's open Thanks yeah thank you all for putting this bill I think it's great what is the penalty boys store that station if they ignore I think it's a big problem especially the wealthy work we have a lot of porn stores and gas stations in Japanese places they're selling stuff what's a ballet experinces yeah and dad can't I mean I believe there is a penalty mechanism for manufacturers that do not comply with state rules I mean all a pledge counsel if you could address that but I do believe that cap would have the authority to not just a manufacturer with a particular store penalized for selling something yeah and we didn't change the purview of dad cap whatever purview they have for other toxic substances that should be tripping to trial through yeah absolutely no that's a great question when you're making sure that this is giving dad kept that opportunity to go out and actually monitor this you know I know there are some stores that buy in bulk and then they make it in the back room put the bottles to order that's what is happening right here this is a label this is actually created yeah this has been labeled from I've learned I've learned a lot about this this the spate creeping is there anywhere in this where such a time for when this new law would take place and is there any a grandfathering in of things that are already on the shelf or would it be once this new law was in place then they would only people would only be able to sell this new product or would it be just in terms of manufacturing in future they'd only be able to manufacture child twist-off is there anything in terms of like a start date or yeah I mean they'd have to promulgate a rule so you have to go through that process you're right until that rule is final so that can take many months to do because we don't know when the rules are done right you know probably later so when that kept probably the bill passes and comes along when that cap probably gets a role in their rule they will set an effective date and will likely put an initial applicability when does this with absolute rule that they commonly get it first apply and maybe where's know what is the bill does allow that cap to expedite the rules to make the process a little bit there's as you are well aware of but there's a timeline for certain procedures to take place in order for rules to go from an idea to taking effect and the bill eliminates some of those requirements what the eliminates the requirement that there be an emergency phone to skip a couple of those steps to first get a rule in place well a permanent rule would be then worked on so it would be a fast your timeline then gets the point of that thing it'd be a faster time land than the normal rule making process but nothing would take effect or an actual rule that's in place and that always specified when the new provisions would apply that authority physics and are they able to create a rule it was prohibited the sale of these types of paper devices religious the in terms of the manufacturer so the bill specifies that the department is required to probably get rules related to the special packaging of liquid nicotine right the rule making process then so that's what the requirement is from the bill and the process that may be expedited rulemaking only applies to what's provided the bill which is they may probably get a rule faster than normal but that rule is only for special packaging for liquid latex penis mask or any other sort of type of issue thank you and I guess I just want to add it I mean currently under it's got to level this is there's no requirement that there be a child who's 14 and I guess that's represent a line Iowa we're specifically looking at the packaging to make sure that if a family but you know somebody purchase it brings it all to their house they're filling up one of the every cigarette that they leave this on the counter that a five-year-old coming by is I'm going to just be able to get the top off easily because they see a monkey on the packaging oh gosh that smells like banana it's not like you know you know what's really in that you're not Michelle kuso representing Wisconsin grocers Association Michelle met her Children's Hospital of Wisconsin registering in favor mark read young Allegheny County Board of Supervisors register in favor and Mary I'm sorry mark rather the time was kinds of Medical Society registering in favor and that concludes our testimony 989 502 and we're gonna go to a B 520 relating to authority of the Department of Agriculture trade consumer protection regarding motor vehicle fueling facilities and we have representative John Ballet here to testify in support I'm sure this one will give me just as simple and quick as that definite last one sorry it's a new year well thank you city didn't as chairman he and members of the committee on consumer protection for holding this public hearing since at least 2002 Wisconsin has required retail locations with unattended fuelling with no employee on site to maintain a telephone or other approved means available to the public to notify the fire department in case of emergency the requirement to have emergency phones at gas stations came from the recommended rule of the National Fire Protection Association very respected but a non-governmental advocacy group that was adopted by then the Wisconsin Department of Commerce without consulting the industry after adoption it wasn't enforced for convenience stores that were open with an inside phone available presumably because Department staff felt it was unnecessary and burdensome well when the Department of Agriculture trade protection conserve protection took over jurisdiction for the regulation of underground storage tanks their interpretation of this rule expanded the requirement to all retail facilities those that were even closed for a period of hours to have an outside phone enforcement this rule is drastically changed in recent months the enforcement itself reflects the time when phones were not readily available in 2013 the Pew Research Center found that 91% of all adults do have carry cell phones with them additionally all gas stations have emergency shutoff switches or buttons clearly visible to customers I would I would submit that if you go to the gas station you'll know where the shut-off is but you don't know where the emergency phone is once these button are pushed a fire cannot spread the tanks avoiding serious disaster therefore it makes sense that once the shutoff button is pushed drivers should exit the scene then at a place of safety use their cell phone to contact emergency services we know of no other businesses that are required to have an emergency phone available to the public 24/7 the Wisconsin petroleum markers and convenience store Association and dad cat have met several times to work on this issue but the department's interpretation of the rule requires enforcement as the co-chair of JCR er I greatly appreciate in the respect that the department recognizes the parameters of their ability to to work on this so we feel the best way to change this burdensome requirement we need to rewrite the law dad cap has agreed to wait to enforce their interpretation so we could address this through legislation we have representatives from the petroleum marketers and businesses here to testify as well they will address the everyday and practical issues regarding this rule so I thank you very much for your time happy to answer any questions thank you very much we do have some additional witnesses Denise Thomas man max Walker representing the WP MCA in favor and thank you for letting me speak today about this important bill I would like to introduce myself I am Denise Thomas and I am co-owner of Pine River mini-marts with my husband Steve we've been in business since 1997 we have two locations in the man talk area and we employ 17 employees the reason I'm here today because I'm asking you to rewrite the law regarding the emergency phones that we need to have located outside of our stores for the public in case of an emergency we are having problems with these phones due to two major reasons weather that we have in our area and then of course vandalism to these phones the phones do not like the rain and then the cold temperatures so it will call out the 911 dispatch and they have and dispatch has to call the store to find out if we're okay and November the phone did just that before we opened our store at our dewlap do stop location the call came in to brand our employee that the phone was calling 911 he needed to check all the phones inside and out of the building she went out to check the phone outside and at the time she was outside three police cars pulled into our building one officer with his gun drawn right up next to her because he thought she was in trouble since she was not supposed to be the cashier outside of the building after she explained to them what had happened and they verified with dispatch that the phone was having issues and Brenda was ok she was able to return to the counter and wait on our customers we had to call the phone tech on Saturday which is over time to come and remove the phone and to order a new one the new phones come with a hefty cost of 577 dollars apiece this phone had just been replaced January of 2015 when it did the same thing the other problem we have is the police department in our area are giving tickets of a hundred and eighty dollars per call if you have more than two false alarms in a 12-month period so now this is added to the total my concern is if there's truly an emergency I would want my customer to call emergency personnel from a safe distance in beside in between the pumps in the store nowadays mostly everyone does carry a cell phone or if there was someone they'll have a cell phone so I'm asking you to reconsider the law on the emergency phones outside thank you for your time and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have I thank you for your test your testimony mr. Thomas and we're gonna ask Freud hope I'm getting this right but that's all basil with quick trip to come on I think the chairman of the committee for allowing us to speak today again we have to quite rope and there's two basic reasons why we support this bill first is how the emergency phones could affect safety and second as a cost in the event of a large spill or fire all sites are equipped with emergency shutoff switches that are designed to de-energize all systems near the fueling operation this would include the canopy the dispensers the submersible pumps etc if a guest has a spill or fire that can quickly hit the emergency stop button and exit the scene the concern regarding a call box or phone in many cases is wouldn't allow them to exit the scene quickly if there was a fire you know if the guests were needing to remain to make that call we'd rather they utilize a cell phone from distance rather than remaining nearby to make a call from a supply device since payphones are no longer readily available and have been removed from most sites the options are wired call boxes or emergency cell phones buying control boxes and having an electrician wear these from the store out to the feeling operation could cost thousands of dollars per location the cheaper option of using an emergency cell phone still has issues of ongoing maintenance cell coverage and cost inspector replace batteries to ensure they still work when needed and with any cult device there's the fact that we want to keep us away from potential fires and not keep them in it while using these devices and just to add something else to with the numbers that were mentioned about the number of people that have cell phones one of the things that I did to find also with our research is that people in the age group of 44 and under that rate is closer to 97% that actually have a cell phone and I'm assuming that number is going to continue to rise represented catch mom thank you for these where many instances their industry or the company where they see was benefited because not from a call box to my knowledge but that's just you know I don't have that information I'm sorry I could certainly dig into that and look and see if we have more information on that any other questions with hearing none mr. Bates all I thank you for your testimony McHugh and us we're going to call Jeremy Elsa Kirk travel mark hello my name is Jeremy all saccharine with travel mark and I'm not gonna go through all the things again because you've just heard most of things I'm gonna say twice's and you know the safety of these phones is certainly comes into issue a lot of people don't even know that we have the phone first of all second if we have an emergency phone and an emergency button they don't know which they should push first and really the emphasis is push the button that'll solve all problems and you're gonna have a lot of different ways to communicate with other people should there be an emergency these phones are regularly vandalized and we certainly and we certainly share the issue of these non-emergency calls being dispatched to the police on a relatively regular basis and also in all of our areas are submitted to these fines from the police department as well and and more importantly than us paying the fines if the police are responding to nuisance calls they're not doing other things that they could be doing that's that's all I have to add any questions for me we have we call Edie Francois from Francois oil company Thank You chairman and committee I'm glad to be here this has been a problem for me for quite some time I am older than some of my associates this rule was put into place before 2002 and it was when we all had paid for all that corner of lower Lots as soon as you were going to remodel or build the phone company AT&T came running in and said you need a payphone it was just a practical thing we had a phone there the rules matched up perfectly over time though payphones now people look for call me up and say do I have one in my warehouse because they want to collect one they become antiques you can't find pay phones in many of our areas step back I operate in Rock Green and Dane County we have 14 locations 170 employees since that time of the payphones on our lines at that time I went back and got some data 1985 there is 300,000 cellphones in this country right now there's 340 thousand three hundred and its coverage of 101 percent the other interesting data data here is in Wisconsin for many thousand people there are seven hundred and twenty six people with driver's license so I've got a 70 percent seventy two percent ratio of drivers and 103 percent cell phones I'd like to demonstrate something if there was something going on in this room and I had to go all the way over that wall and pick up a phone battle and won one it's much faster if I do this because I can and that is the difference in the times when this was put in place yeah we were a communication center in the olden days you know he used to go down to a call box at the corner to report something in today's technology this is I think we can get rid of this phone it causes problems it dials by itself it has to be maintained and I'm pretty sure that I don't want my customer except to get further away from whatever it is and dial nine-one-one and then the right agencies will show up so I do have some other stuff but it would be boring it's marked some of the newer dispensers have shut out Bachmann's on everybody the there is always one on the front of the building and always has a riddle a little red thing saying of the emergency show and I tell you that those are bulletproof but they work very well they do not lock up our systems someone goes up and push that in and Isis all the power everything outside is that kind of family well let me know how do you get a kid that likes to shut you down but you just have to reset each one there's typically up to three inability to inside and one outside sometimes on all of us been system you have to go that concludes our testimony but I do have registering in favor Senator Tom Tiffany Jennifer Bato of the Wisconsin petroleum marketers and convenience Association favor Scott here representing us venture registering in favor John Manske representing the co-operative network registering in favor and Josie Joleen flouts representing Kwik Trip registering in favor we have one party registering against that's Dave Blum Wisconsin State fire chiefs Association now we have our hearing on 5:20 and we move to they're required to bring in a new form specified by do T to put manufacturers on manufacturers on notice of the repair in continued discussions with do T car dealers manufacturers and attorneys who practice in this area senator Petrowski and I determined the form is unnecessary every time a consumer has their vehicle serviced under warranty the manufacturers have a record of this repair and because of this are already on notice of a potential lemon law claim also it is very possible that the potential of a lemon law issue might not even cross the consumers mind at the initial point in time of the first repair this bill is very simple and lessens the burden the burden on and the confusion to the consumer by eliminating that form requirement from the lemon law process the amendment to the bill before you makes the change in the legislation apply retroactively ly to March 1st 2014 which was the effective date of the 2013 Wisconsin act 1 1 which would created the G ot form requirement for the owners report of nonconformity this way anyone who was confused by the form requirement and failed to submit it back to the March 1st 2014 we'll still be able to utilize the lemon law to remedy their situation again I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this pretty simple bill and I'd be happy to answer any questions committee members may have in order for the lemon law to apply we're going to be relying on the car dealership to do the reporting it would be rather than the consumer who feels well the consumer would be would have the lemon law the statute be able to still utilize the statutes and say to the dealer the manufacturer look I've had this vehicle in here five six times or whatever the statutory requirements are and then that and that would still take place what this does is it gets rid of the d-o-t required form we had some anecdotal evidence even from consumers who would bring a form to a dealer and the dealer was even unaware of the form and so they wouldn't even sign the form because they didn't know what it was but they still maintain all those records and to have those records to have the repairs covered by the manufacturer under the warranty all those things have to be submitted to the to the manufacturer anyway so the records will still exist for the consumer to say look I've been in here this many times and the vehicle still has the same problem I'm not if they wanted the services covered by the manufacturer's warranty because they would have to provide that information to the warranty the manufacturer to have it covered by the warranty so if they decided they just wanted to eat the cost to try and get around it I don't think there'd be any deal which is unwilling to do that to maintain those warranty records and so also let me and I believe failure to do so on the dealers part could put their franchise agreement in limbo and they could lose their ford chevy dealership just by violating that in terms of a contract that can weigh in on this is there any situation where it could be something that would not be covered by the warranty that would that we would not then have records of of the situation that were that you were discussing it wasn't covered by the you're saying if it wasn't covered by the original manufacturer's warranty shed they still wanted to have something fixed I believe under the lemon law and represented Vandermeer would have more experience in this than I would but I believe that the for the lemon law to be effective it has to be within a certain time period of purchase of the vehicle and most if not all repairs of a mechanical nature would be covered within that time period by the manufacturer's warranty I think I've got that right great [Music] I'm gonna train with doing Ross and Stevens here at Madison I acted with the lemon law since its inception I helped for a little speck way back when with it and actually for since 83 to the last revision this first notice thing wasn't there we didn't need it and here's why what happened was when you take a car in for it warranty repair the dealership is going to use the AG department required form to for those repairs they do it for all repairs whether warranty or otherwise the dealership in order to be paid for those warranty repairs adjusted in your car have to submit that to the manufacturer in the format the manufacturer requires which is the methodology which the manufacturer wants to be informed with you know that's that's how the manufacturer must be informed about that warranty repairs through their process internally and then they were University ler for the work when this came up it's kind of my mistake in a way that this happened I wasn't paying attention to the submitted by the lawyer from the manufacturers I didn't know what that it was deal key form that he put down I didn't catch that or actually that may have been to have it afterwards because the use of the AG form has always been adequate you can always count from that those forms are also they also have time in time out this is all used for counting the days out of service how long was it in the shop when was it first submitted that all comes from this this added form is just redundant and unnecessary I'm I think most dealers probably throw them in the wastebasket if they mailed him off to the manufacturer they wouldn't know what to do with it they have there no procedure for for receiving that form it was just a it was a I don't know what you'd call it but it was an extra poop that the consumer had to go through before they could smell coming in it and it made a difference I had one person came in and they had one of these trikes that was stalling out all the time it had an intermittent electrical problem and it been purchased after this one into effect and they were getting caught in the middle of the country you know when the thing stopped over and over and over again they couldn't fix it and they racked up I think 20 25 days before they realized oh they finally checked on the limit because I figured that's when they figured out well this may be a lemon we better check out it so they checked this website discovered this form and realize they hadn't been turning it in so then they started turning it in the dealer just in pain but then they started turning him in they lost the twenty five days as part of their 30 days so eventually the thing got fixed but it was another twenty days after that so they didn't hit their lemon law relief because they hadn't used that form but the manufacturer know all along everything that was going on because they were getting the warranty claims and paying for it on the rest of it so we're just collecting on tenant consequence of a mistake in drafting that's all this about that's that's why I don't think the measure the manufacturers agreed with this when they saw it and realized what was going on they realized that they really couldn't art make a good argument why this was necessary and I think we all sat down and agreed that this should be done I would have done a lot more to change the lemon law back the way you used to be but we all agreed this will be good enough for now [Music] the testimony we do have some registered in favor registering in favor senator Jerry Petrowski also son-in-law registering in favor Nate Han Department of Transportation registering in favor Katie McDermott of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers also registering in favor Chris Snyder Wisconsin auto and truck dealers association with that I believe that concludes all our registrations all our testimony and all our bills for today and so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]"
CUDslaI4QPQ,RI,09-13-2013,"for bills that will hear our bills number 3 54 91 and 625 the deal builds a deal with the motor vehicle violations the last one is 625 let's see we have to hear on the bills Joey led back of the department Attorney General Barry Shilla Hillary Davis if you can come forward and is there a MOX let's start with you Joey Thank You chairman these bills that you have in front of you would increase penalties for those who are injured by serious bodily injury or death in motor vehicle violations they provide for additional fines and additional license suspensions when someone is killed or seriously injured we think these are great highway safety initiatives and fully support them on behalf of the Attorney General are there any questions or comments for this witness on any of the bills thank you Hilary Davis thank you chairman and members of the committee the ACLU is speaking only to 6:25 at this time we are concerned that this adds additional penalties there are a number of different laws already governing these kinds of situations and so we feel that this legislation is redundant and relatively unnecessary under the law thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness Thank You mr. Schiller the same as far as I could tell what those go to intersection violations at college or back in the right talk about the infield you said the client law because captain because there's so many cases where someone is killed or injured by a motorist who was not doing something criminally negligent wasn't drunk didn't do a hit-and-run and didn't knowingly drive with reckless disregard for the safety of others which is a creek which if you convicted of that you can go to jail it's a serious offense it's very hard to prove so I submitted testimony of an example where someone was killed in a crosswalk by a motorist who the person was elderly wasn't walking that fast and the motorist killed him and all he got was an $85 fine because the current laws are not adequate to address that situation I'm a proud card-carrying member of the ACLU but the ACL u--'s objection I believe has no validity because the current law allows people to to be killed without without penalty beyond the eighty-five dollar fine for for going into a crosswalk but the trouble is that the six excuse me that 350 and 491 only cover intersection violations so I've provided testimony to the chair and to the committee that at least for pedestrians and for bicyclists most of the injuries from on the road are not at intersections and the evidence is in legislative things itself transportation series from the National Conference of State Legislators if you have a copy that's just the cover to show you where it comes from on the back on page 22 the very first paragraph says only 24% of pedestrian deaths and only 33% of bicycle fatalities occurred at intersections so the amendment I'm suggesting is to cover it with the same penalties as the bill that Senator McCaffrey introduced the same penalties cover any moving violations such as the one in the crosswalk or one other infamous case some of you may have heard of Frank's law Frank Cabral was killed on a bicycle and a shoulder on route 1 and the motorists veered off the the travel lane onto the shoulder and killed the bicyclist and had no penalty because they they weren't drunk they didn't do it on purpose no criminal and so there was no there was no penalty beyond traveling in the wrong lane even though someone was killed again the current laws don't cover that situation beyond the $85 fine so it was called Frank's law the curse of Frank Cabral who was killed that way without the motorist having any penalty and as far as 625 that's another approach to the whole thing the here I'm speaking for the Bicycle Coalition in the previously are speaking just for myself as a transportation activist but now this is a pill senator suits now ski put in at the request of the Bicycle Coalition in response to Frank's law and what we like about that version of the same problem is that it calls attention to vulnerable road users like bicyclist and pedestrians and people in wheelchairs and highway workers and first responders who are out on the road and need protection from dangerous driving not criminal driving that's already covered but just careless driving that results in accidents the resulting in injuries or death and it's it happens all over the state I I just want to mention that in Rhode Island and I'll provide this to the clerk I didn't provide it to the chair yet in 2011 the last year I have data there was 66 traffic fatalities in Rhode Island and of those 66 14 were pedestrians that's that's a lot that's that's 21 percent of the roadway fatalities are pedestrians so those people need protection and I think you'll agree that we all have a societal interest in promoting walking and bicycling it's good for the environment it's good for health it's good for the economy it doesn't use imported fuel to do those things so we have a societal interest to protect the people doing that and I think I thank you for your attention senator Matz yes mr. Schiller just a quick question for you because I'd been riding my bike I've been run off the road myself but there's uh there's some people that ride the bike that they're aggressive they go through the lights and they go through the stop signs and do they have to follow the traffic laws too because I would hate to see someone punished if the person is running the light on a bicycle or going through the stop sign yeah so where do we draw the line that's my question that's a very good question and and bicyclists are in this bill that we're talking about bicyclists are not given the right to do that the only way a motorist could be in 6:25 if I can get that the motorist has to fail to see if so much paper in front of me I'm sorry the motorist has to think the language is it's not automatic that the motorist is that fall it's only when the person operating the motor vehicle fails to exercise due care to avoid colliding with the bicyclist and I think that's a fair standard but it's not a criminal standard and that's why we need this law are there any other questions or comments thank you we do have some more witnesses signed up to testify Don Rhodes Bob Vitara yeah if I may Bob vltava just submitted a letter which I believe is in given to the chair through the clerk and Don Rose who's a friend of mine who is have some disability had difficulty getting here he just wanted to point out that that transit passengers he's the head of the RIPTA riders Alliance and transit passengers like him are also vulnerable road users because when you have to cross to the bus stop especially Don he has a walks with a cane and he has to go slow so he's at risk and he supports this bill to protect the transit passengers thank you thank you miss Mott Thank You mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Eugenio Marx I work for the Audubon Society of Rhode Island and I'm a member of the Coalition for transportation choices in that capacity I work with municipalities on pedestrian and bicycle issues I also work with them as they have Department of Health grants for healthy places or healthy communities and in these plans some of the cities are designing what are called sharrows which are specifically lanes for bicycles and vehicles share the road so we particularly need this bill just to bring people's attention to the fact that they are driving this thousand plus pounds of steel and and plastic and so forth and just to call their alertness to this fact as mr. Shaw pointed out there have been pedestrians killed crossing streets having debarked from RIPTA vehicles as well as a number of fatalities in the testimony written testimony that I will provide from the National Highway Safety plan for Rhode Island this is US Department of Transportation information information through 2010 shows an upward trend in pedestrian deaths in the state of Rhode Island and we ask you for consideration of this fill with a positive outcome are there any questions or comments sent on the body mr. chairman just a comment I noticed that the statute reads that the motorist under we're talking about six to five that a motorist is for want of a better term responsible while operating a motor vehicle and my office is on Broadway and Providence and that's one of the corridors now where they have made bike paths merging with traffic on Broadway you know I questioned the the competency of doing that because it's a pretty dangerous road but I've seen three or four bicyclists go down as a result of the motorists not while operating the vehicle but while parked opening the door and having the motorists of the bike list that's an occultation so maybe site while operating maybe not the proper language for the statute thank you for that observation Thank You senator are there any other questions or comments does anyone else wish to speak on these three bills with that Senator Lynch moves to hold for further study bill number 350 bill number 491 and bill number 625 seconded by Senator Matz all those in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bill is a health of further study the next bill we'll do with Senator Bates is bill bill number 43 senator Bates if you want to come forward we do have one person here to testify on behalf of the bill so we let back at the Department of the Attorney General Thank You mr. chairman in 21 years up here I didn't think I'd ever see anything like this bill I got a call from going to constituent who suggested to me that there was 17 states in Rhode Island 101 that allowed visitation rights to a rapist I thought that was kind of outrageous but I checked with ledge counsel and I think more than anything from omission that it's possibility so this bill came out at basically prohibits visitation rights to a rapist to his offspring from the rape except in certain circumstances and that's in there because in some cases of spousal rape I think it might be want to be granted but it's pretty straightforward bill and I didn't be happy to answer any questions are there any questions from Senator Bates thank you is there anyone else would like to speak on behalf of this bill with that Senator Lynch moves to hold for further study seconded by Senator Metz all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills held for further study I did see senator DePalma senator Palmer why don't you come forward on your bill your bill is bill number 771 get stats Anitha Thank You mr. chairman members of the committee I'll be brief I know there'll be others that will come after me that I'll have more detail and experience with regards to the proposed intent of the bill you have in front of you what the bill seeks to do and I'll talk to you about the rationale for subsequent to that it seeks to at its basis to create a database for the registration of the vehicle insurance for vehicles currently today based on Rhode Island general law chapter 31 - 47 - 8.1 there's a provision in the law and this came about also in review as part of the Commissioner charity and many there are a couple folks here at least the directors ovo's members Sofia's member of it where we came forward and had a proposal that we look at how do we take this to the next level with regards to ensuring that motorists of motor vehicles that owners of Motor Vehicles have insurance and today right now it's done via a random sample via mail to get that accomplished what this bill seeks to do is create a database whereby insurers would provide information to the Division of Motor Vehicles on insurance policies whether it's once a month or twice a month buy in a certain date so that information we've made available so that they can cross check between registrations and insurance to ensure that all those with a valid registration have insurance as required by by the law today so that's what this seeks to do there are several bills that are have been submitted this is one of those there's several other bills that have been that are have been introduced should I say I believe we need to be looking at this from a starting point perspective walk before we run in with regards to getting this accomplished we're all familiar I think we all are and we've heard about it many of the folks here been in the Senate longer than I have where the system called rims rhode island motor vehicle system that's currently being developed by HP and expect to have online hopefully knock on wood next year early next year as opposed to later next year we'll see and that shouldn't provide us some of the availability to accomplish this but clearly that will provide a means to get there from here but we still need a legislation or I'll call it a mandate it is a mandate to make this happen and not enabling this would enable this neighborhood to happen but this would create the means by which insurers would provide the information about those being insured and the DMV would be able to look at it from the perspective of vehicles that are registered to insure those vehicles that are registered are in fact insured so some of us might say well of course in order to be insure registered a vehicle must be insured the challenge happens when those are vehicles that are registered and someone loses their insurance for whatever reason and then lapses what happens after that we've all know people either current family members friends or whatever relatives that have been in the situation where they've been in an accident or whatever caused by someone else who didn't have an insurance well sometimes how can that happen everybody has to have insurance this would help to eliminate some of those loopholes that are currently in the currently exist now somebody senator in the ideal world this will also give instant access to the police department that responds to that accident correct absolutely so that they can access that because otherwise they're going to show a card that's six months old that shows that their insurance is there so absolutely it'd be means by electronic means to facilitate many different needs whether it's law enforcement whether it's in truth of insurance whether it's registration the cross checking and verification would be made valid available via this database are there any other questions for the sponsor thank you Thank You mr. chairman members of the committee we have here to speak Anthony Silva and Richard caste Allah good afternoon or welcome good afternoon mr. chair members of the committee I'm here in my capacity as administrator DMV chess to a and assure you that DMV several members of DMV including myself have held several meetings with representatives of the insurance industry Department of Business Regulation the bill's sponsor in fact we've met we have a meeting tomorrow not to further discuss this we're looking at a very sensible practical approach as Senator Palmer just tell you to walk before we run so that we can institute some type of a viable insurance verification program in Rhode Island that would be obviously good for all residents in our state are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you Thank You mr. chairman I'm Brian Jordan representing insurer right my colleague Richard Costello from mnsure right can explain a lot more about the the process and the insurer right system a Senator DePalma alluded to what's created in the bill would be a database in which the auto insurers would submit information to to the company or the organization running a database and the DMV would also submit information ensure right is the model that embodies that that concept right now this process is being utilized in in Texas and Utah it's and as Richard will describe when Utah began the this the system they had an uninsured rate around 19 20 percent and over the course of its duration and operation that uninsured rate has dropped significantly to around 4 or 5 percent I believe so I will I will defer to Richard to describe the insurer rate model good afternoon and welcome thank you was Jeremy just make sure the red button is up how's that start working Oh elf there's a big any difference I thank you for this opportunity we're in support very much of Senator Palmer's bill the thing that we bring to the table that I hope will be helpful to this committee in their deliberations is that the conceptual reality of this is that it's no longer a concept we have been doing this for and I say we the program has been in effect since 1990 Oh for I was much younger than it could remember better we have been uninterrupted since that time the uninsured motorist rate in Utah even though the IRC which is what we what many people use as the basis for what the uninsured motorist rate is showed us at nine and a half percent in Utah when in actuality when the baseline was put together it was twenty three and a half percent we are now consistently under 4% this has been a in cooperation with the different divisions of the state if it wasn't for the division of Public Safety wasn't for the DMV law enforcement and ourselves I don't think a program like this would be successful and I certainly endorse the concept from the DMV that we walk before we run a couple of quick things if I may it is a turnkey operation the state has little or no real it has little or no real impact on the state's finances or on the state's infrastructure all of the hardware etc software is already in place been running for many many years not only with my organization but with my competitors so one of the good things is it's been proven our organization has is the only one that has been audited independently we have in Utah approximately eight audits maybe nine we have one beginning audit in the state of Texas which proves pretty well that the concept works and it's very simple insurance companies send the information we match the information to vehicle put that online your question senator was is online for law enforcement absolutely in real-time we also then have by default a list of those that are uninsured and we encourage a proactive approach that we send out a letter to these people and say listen guys you don't have insurance what can we do to rectify the situation and it has proven that that particular component of the program is equally as important as the interaction between law enforcement other than that we try to to we have all kinds of handout materials and all kinds of years but I don't know that we need to go into that the most important fact is it's a proven program it is a turnkey program with little or no impact upon the state and it will and should if there has been the same in the state of Rhode Island as it has in other places it will reduce the uninsured motorist you have you are there any questions accomplished senator mess yeah well for anyone who is you mentioned that it was a turnkey new impact on the state but who pays for it somebody's got to pay I believe in the bill you will see a reinstatement fee and that reinstatement fee should be very positive if we are lucky enough to be successful in the RFP process we're looking somewhere around five or six hundred thousand dollars probably to do the program for a year the revenue generated if it goes with the same way it has in other states should generate revenue somewhere between six and eight million dollars are there any other questions or comments senator Archibald Thank You mr. chair I commend senator the Palmer and director for this bill and what it's going to do for regionalizing one concept of data for insurance my question is if someone has insurance and then the insurance is canceled how fast would that come up would it come up on the software and how fast in real time so that law enforcement could access and I think it's great that law enforcement can now use this instead of an officer in the field saying do you have insurance typically when they don't have insurance some more we use the discretion to say well fax me the copy the insurance a couple of days I won't write to the citation on it or they'll write the citation then you bring the insurance of the Registry of Motor Vehicles if someone doesn't have insurance how fast would it come up on the database and then the second question is if they have insurance it cancels how fast would it come up that's a really good question and one that comes up quite a bit senator it depends on what the rule business rules are if it is a twice a month reporting period it should be with a matter of days if it's with if it's longer than that it could be as much as two or three weeks that is an important process so whether it cancels or whether they change it makes no difference because what we receive from the insurance companies is immediately put into the database concept there is and I can infer from that that you would receive notice of cancellations and then they'd be updated within probably at the longshots a month well actually no we don't look for cancellations we look for we ask the insurance companies just to do one thing press a button and give us everything that's enforced so if you were with State Farm and you cancelled or changed over to farmers it would no longer be at State Farm it would now be at farmers or whatever so we we take care of the administration and try to take that burden from the insurance companies about sending a notice that make sense it does I was looking at the far end of how just maybe I'm thinking down the road to where this as soon as we get the information at least in our situation it usually is updated within a few hours that's great Thank You senator boy you have a question I do I want to follow up with senator holds question because this appears to be when an individual we news the registration there's a question with regard to their liability insurance much of that information at the registry is not correct and after a year or so the public can actually for $11.50 request an abstract and I'd say 50% of the time the information that comes back is is not correct part of the cancellation switching a carrier vehicles had a total loss they've registered a new vehicle you know nodding your head and this this is problematic for people who need to have that information especially many attorneys the question that I have is that how will this cure that problem if it will I'm not exactly sure what the problem is if you're talking about this person what I know I'm old so you've got a you know does this mean that the information being accurate at time of registration the one I don't think there's any verification that the registry utilizes right now to verify that the information given by the party registering the vehicle is even true okay that's a really good question that's number one then number two when that particular information is sour or it's obsolete or they've changed there's no way of updating that current because there's a gap in time when you V new registrations you don't do it annually so there are issues with that data and it's not accurate and I'm just wondering would this particular bill not cure it but improve it yes it would because of the how the intervals of when the information is is given once a month twice a month whatever the RFP turns out to be that would be updated immediately and that information if the RFP calls for that information to be supplied to registration they would have that immediately as would law enforcement and and is the same with changes they would be sent sent down hi I just want your opinion on one of the question I noticed is under safety responsibilities as a requirement that when a party's involved in an automobile collision where there's a certain amount of damage greater I think than $1,000 the parties are required to file state accident reports I noticed in the governor's budget or above in his proposal that that's being eliminated I know the registry has made a tremendous amount of money on renewals where they've notified the parties that they've failed to file those reports in the consumer or the operator gets a cancellation notice shouldn't that be something that we keep as a law to strengthen this particular movement under this bill I would again it's outside of my purview a little bit but I would so I would support that in in Utah not so much in in Texas or some of the other states but in Utah there is a financial responsibility program where these accident reports are actually filed with with the department and they investigate them and we have been able to reduce the staff time still doing the job but we do this down time by half no because actually that's a way to identify when a person is involved in an accident they list the carrier they list the policy the effective dates of that coverage I would imagine at that point and the registry verifies whether or not that policy still active so I think hand-in-hand maybe we ought to consider maybe if the governor is looking to eliminate that we may want to put some to my team they'll be happy to to help if we can't you are there any other questions or comments from any committee members mr. Silva Thank You mr. chair senator Chabot I believe the gentleman on my left is very knowledgeable with the product that he's offering but I respectfully have to disagree with the comment that he made that we would have to continue keeping what we refer to as a state DMV report the State DMV report the proposal ployment they eliminate that came from my office as administrator for several reasons currently a person who was involved in the motor vehicle crash in Rhode Island you know police department responds and takes the crash of the thousand dollars damage as you as you just said or mind an injury either case there's a report that has to be filed with the police department which is very which is the same as the state DMV report that DMV report part of me strike that the motor vehicle crash report by the police department when I began as a young policeman thirty two years ago was a one-page one front page report to DMV report at the time was two pages okay so if fire exceeded the information that we received at the crash scene the DMV reported today the motor vehicle crash report uniform a motor vehicle crash report completed by a police department police officer is approximately six to eight pages long the DMV report is still two pages long we suspend we have approximately eleven thousand suspensions right now in the state of Rhode Island license suspensions for failure to complete that DMV accident report and that is a travesty it's a travesty to the citizens of Rhode Island who are involved in a crash who have a police officer come to the scene they then go to the police department they get a copy of that six to eight page report they submit that to the insurance company the insurance company looks at and says great you filed a report and then they don't file that additional DMV report that has been on the books for 40 years and is antiquated archaic and should have been eliminated years ago now you did make a comment rather and you were absolutely correct there is approximately two hundred fifty to two hundred sixty thousand dollars of revenue that we receive based on the suspensions but those people who are getting suspended are people like us ordinary citizens who've never committed a crime in their life who then find that they're stopped by a police officer for rolling through a stop sign or five miles over the limit and then they're told that their license is suspended because they didn't complete a DMV report the vehicle gets towed they end up with a licensee reinstatement fee of one hundred fifty one dollars and fifty cents which is mandatory at the DMV and we're the only state in the six state and that continues to have that DMV report all the other five states have eliminated it we we did our research I reached out to my colleagues in other states and law enforcement and at the DMV in those states and for all the reasons we have requested that this be eliminated we're requesting it as well I do want to point out to you that the only reason why we haven't eliminated at the airport as of today is because we need to needed to make the necessary changes to the uniform car crash report that there's two items on it and it basically it's the validation time period the expiration period of the motor vehicle insurance we need to add that to that report and that's shortcoming probably with by June 1st and when that happens we're going to eliminate that on the report and it's a it's a great service it's a customer service thing the bottom line is that what it isn't again the gentleman on my left just is not aware of the process nor the culture here in Rhode Island no disrespect to him invite by any stretch of imagination and he and I had discussed this previously he would've been telling you the same thing that I just told I'm sure let me at Mare mr. Chia let me just follow up those crash reports the public has accessed their different charges based on the number of pages some departments who actually receives the money when the public will go up online and draw those reports down do you know I do not know sir does the state receive any money from that for drawing the reports there's a charge online when you do oh yes I am aware which who actually is I do not I do not believe but I may stand corrected I do not believe the DMV or the state receives any of those charges so want to know and my questions but up till now 11,000 individuals have suspended license or registrations when you eliminate this requirement how many more people then will be out there and don't have insurance or won't be filing these reports there's nothing to keep them in hold with the law if we eliminate I apologize senator I may not have explained myself completely if I confuse I apologize for that we are currently right now for those crash reports that we're not receiving the DMV report we're using the Uniform Crime Report those get sent to us electronically by all the police upon us so the answer your question is we're getting that all information in then some but the individual driver there will be a elimination of that individual filing the report at New London after a will that's correct it will no longer be required thanks are there any other questions or comments senator Akshar ball Thank You mr. chair just just a quick come at the amplify on it it's I'm understanding it correctly directed simply that the police report itself a unified crime report is made out by every officer for every accident and the state report is a redundancy and people are getting suspended because they don't fill the thing out remember being or us or on the job and somebody hit me and I did a five or six page police report and then I get a letter from the Registry of Motor Vehicles I hadn't filed it within 14 days and my license was going to get suspended in a police car as an office again hit by somebody and I couldn't agree more it's duplicated it's never done this yeah thank you are there any other questions or comments senator Boyle I'm going to disagree with senator Shambala mr. director I'm going to disagree cuz half of the reports that we read or wrong to begin with the version of how the incident occurred is not correct so it's it's vital to the individual filing to also there are many people that don't get an opportunity to indicate how an incident occurred and so half of the reports first of all that version is never admissible in a court anyhow most judge will say I don't want to know anything from the officer about how the accident happened I just want to know that they showed up they took the names and that is it so a lot of those reports are not correct and that's why I am against terminating what your divisions trying to do no disrespect thank you are there any other questions or comments thank you with that Senator jabo moves to old bill number 771 for foot mr. Bonta you want to speak you weren't in the list of names come forward please I'll be very brief I apologize I thought it had been sent up to you mr. chairman mr. chairman I'd like to I represent the property charge the Insurance Association you're used to seeing Steve zoobi ah go here but in his stead I'd like to mention that I signed up for this particular bill and I signed up as a proponent of the bill I may actually at Apple I'm not against the bill I'm a proponent of the concept that we have to do something about the uninsured motorist problem in the state of Rhode Island and it's not necessarily this piece of legislation I believe that you have several bills relating to uninsured motorists and I'll only speak to this one actually senator DePalma but a couple bills in for us that were under consideration in the house corporations committee I wanted to mention to the committee that we see this as a problem and we have had three meetings so far with the Department of Motor Vehicles and in fact we have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow and through the good graces of DMV administrator Silva we've been meeting at his offices with the Department of Business Regulation Paula Pelosi ourselves and I believe we've asked that major pinch also attend because we want some input from the State Police because obviously they're an important component of whatever transpires on uninsured motorists this particular bill is a duplicate to a bill that was sponsored by Senator Kennedy our representative Kennedy the house corporation's chairman and I believe as early as last week if I'm a director Silva mentioned to Representative Kennedy that were meeting and hopefully that we can hold his bill instead to come up with some kind of a a compromise we've also at the meeting has been Brian Jordan and in all instances at the meeting they have been represented by represented represented by the individuals who are here today either Richard or his counterpart have played an active role and I think they have a good system but our objective is some of the proprietary information that is requested the second phase we put in we had a person come in to give an illustration of another model doesn't this necessary to take the fact that they couldn't be the vendor on that model but in any event I think that Senator De Palma said it all we have to you know walk before we run we have to think before we legislate because of the fact there are many problems that the DMV are encountering with their an IT system you have to remember that we're starting from almost no very case verification system absolutely nothing so anything that this good legislature passes is going to improve the system but it's what their IT system can handle it's the information that we can support and we gladly support as an insurance industry because it's to everyone's benefit because people are getting buried with uninsured motorists in this state and we want to solve the problem it's not necessarily with this bill it could be with this vendor but we would we would like to continue talking and bring back whatever report we have through the administrators over to this committee at the proper time either through correspondence or another hearing and I thank you for allowing me to say these through where it's mr. chairman and members of the committee senator Lambada yeah I I think you hit it right on the head I this I embrace this legislation I think it's critical there's several lawyers on this committee and I can't tell you the number of times how frustrating it is to have a police report the crash report come there with a an insurer listed as the the tortfeasors insurer and only to find out that the policy had expired two months earlier and it's said I'm not talking about the concern of those these little soft tissue cases where you might have an under insurance coverage which our own insurance but you know there are several cases in my office right now where they were absolutely substantial serious injuries where these people presented even the minimum amount of coverage at the scenes of the police officer only to find out that that policy had been cancelled three or four months earlier and that's really problematic and I think that's what this bill is trying to head off well that's why I support the concept of the bill but I hope that we can amend it so that it can fit the needs of the Department of Motor Vehicles who has nothing now starting with something and at the same time protect the proprietary information that we want to protect because you know I we represent a thousand insurance companies the Association and and basically you know it is under the antitrust and everything else we want to just make sure that the information we have to provide is something that is the only information that's necessary to achieve what your goal that you could got you good gentleman wanna and ladies want to accomplish senator Dubois Henry thank you for your testimony but I'll say this mandatory insurance was put in a long time ago we ought to be ashamed that right now we still can't get a handle on who's insured and who's not but if we can't get this correct then maybe agents shouldn't be telling the applicants to reject uninsured motorist because if we can't get our hands on the problem then we ought to think about putting a bill that says not only is it mandatory for liability coverage but it's also mandatory for uninsured motorist coverage and then people won't be walking away thinking that they have the appropriate coverage so I think the industry needs to look at that as well thank you are there any other questions or comments with that senator ball moves to hold 771 for further study seconded by Senator Lombardi all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bill is held for further study the next bill we have is you the next bill we have is bill number 622 that's a bill by majority leader rogério and we have a number of people here signed up to testify we'll start with John Hogan jr. Steve Boyana Vianney Laura Akers Patricia Nolan mr. Hogan good afternoon welcome Thank You mr. chairman uh it's a privilege to be before this committee again and pleasure to be back home in Rhode Island my name is Jack Hogan I work in public affairs with Reynolds American which is a second largest largest tobacco company locally in the United States and located in winston-salem North Carolina and we're here to voice our support for Senate bill 622 we think this is an important bill because it addresses the current law in Rhode Island regarding access to tobacco products by youth in it and actually what this bill does is it extends the current law to products while not tobacco products and are not yet covered in this area and we're speaking specifically of two types of products electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes which have been in the marketplace for approximately six years and are available for sale here at retail in Rhode Island and in an emerging product that is really in very limited distribution around the United States and and that's a tobacco derived nicotine products as a defined in the bill but these are lozenges or that contain nicotine derived from tobacco but do not contain tobacco it's important to note that under Rhode Island law there is no prohibition against - purchasing electronic cigarettes and we think that the law should be changed and we think that this bill sets about to do that now I'd like to point out that we believe that this law as it's currently written has been effective in combating youth access to tobacco products if you were to look at the statistics maintained by the federal government you'll see in the last 15 years the the youth smoking rate here in Rhode Island has dropped by more than half and we also think that if you look at statistics provided by the state of Rhode Island the federal government a significant part of this has been due to the good work of the retailers the licensed retailers who sell tobacco products in Rhode Island the recent numbers submitted by the state of Rhode Island the federal government indicates that there's a violation rate of about eleven percent which means that almost 90 percent of retailers are in compliance according to the checks but what I'd like to do here is address the three or four key points of this bill because the laws that restrict access to tobacco products in the laws that we think should limit access to cigarette products cover a couple of different areas of the statute and so if you'll just permit me to walk through what I think of the key pieces of this bill and explain why we think this is important quite simply section one is the core of the bill it includes these electronic cigarettes which I'll eat defined as a vapor product and tobacco derived nicotine products in the current prohibition against the purchase possession or use of tobacco products by minors now it's important because these products are not currently covered that this section also defines a vapor product an electronic cigarette and I'll show you what one looks like and it also defines a tobacco derived nicotine product those lozenges that contain nicotine that I spoke of earlier in addition to prohibiting purchase possession and use and defining the product section one also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes by retailers it requires a mandatory sign at retail it prohibits distribution of samples of electronic cigarettes to minors and would prohibit the distribution or sale through the mail to minors now I think this particular section of the bill might elicit a little bit of discussion today and what what was intended here was to incorporate the electronic cigarette product in the tobacco drive cigarette product in the existing law you see of a section in the law that requires age verification upon delivery and I think that there may be so folks will quarrel with the way that's that the bill addresses this point we'd be happy to discuss that if there's a maybe another way to go at it and that's the nobility that's the core of the bill of what it does in Section 1 prohibits youth purchase use of possession defines the product prohibits sale requires signage and prohibits samples I'd like to draw your attention to the definitions because there are two specific definitions but let's you have a question I do and I apologize for interrupting during your presentation I don't know if I'm jumping the gun or what and you've defined a couple of the products one of the things that I see in here that I don't I don't know if I don't understand or is not explained well enough but a vapor product what are the vapor products include the the vapor product include would essentially includes the what is known or referred to as an electronic cigarette the reason we suggest that the term vapor product is the better approach than electronic cigarette is the legal definition of a cigarette is a role of tobacco in paper an electronic cigarette for those of you are not familiar essentially has three parts but it notably it does not contain tobacco it contains a vial of liquid which contains nicotine and other ingredients it contains a battery and it contains a heating element and what it does is eat the liquid and create a vapor which then the user referred to I think as vapors to inhale or take in the vapor from the product so while the popular nomenclature in the common nomenclature is e cigarette we think that the more precise term vapor product is probably more accurate because unlike a cigarette this does not burn tobacco and it does pretty create smoke it creates a nicotine vapor and with respect to that definition there's also a clause in the definition that does not in that seeks to exclude from the definition of vapor products any products that have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration as nicotine replacement therapies or as drugs for therapeutic purposes so the purpose of this bill is not to include those products that are preserved used for a medical purpose such as nicorette gum or transdermal patches or nicotine inhalers we are talking about electronic cigarettes which we define which we suggest should be defined as vapor products and seek to extend the prohibition of against access by - to these products centered on body Jack I don't mean to interrupt as well but but in carrying on senator Lynch's question isn't there also in for lack of a better term and II hookah now as well the making products hookah products as well and that's why that we think originally think the vapor product is the better definition because you can find in the marketplace of an e cigar an e pipe e-cigarettes and learn something every day I did not know there was an e hookah but thank you very much for bringing that up and so we think aboard a broader definition will capture all of these products which as we understand do essentially the same thing heat a liquid to deliver nicotine vapor I like to know where the e cigars are save a lot of money but that's another story senator Nessa Busch yes thank you mr. chairman and a little bit confused is the purpose of the bill to prohibit these e-cigarettes and if so why is there other stuff in the bill about regulating it and controlling it and taxing it if we're going to prohibit it well we're not prohibiting we're prohibiting access by minors this bill is simply to prohibit the purchase use in possession of these products by minors not prohibit the product for purchase by adults here in Rhode Island only restrict and prohibit the use and access by minors is that is that clear yes and quite simply senator the way the law is constructed as it's currently constructed the provisions addressing youth access are found in essentially two main chapters first the chapter entitled children which is the core of the bill in section 1 and also the the term vapor and vapor products in vapor derived products are also included in the licensing section which is section 3 of the bill and are these vapor cigarettes are they bad for the health of adults in a similar way or what are the health ramifications of these evei / products well first and foremost no tobacco product is safe however it is and our company intends to go into national distribution with our product this year currently the literature indicates that the electronic cigarette does not expose the user to the constituents that are found in smoke from smoking a traditional cigarette and quite simply the weight of the health information is that it is the constituents in the smoke from a cigarette that causes the health problems because this does not is not tobacco smoke and does not have those constituents on that there is the sciences emerging in this area but it it's it's a I believe that to accurately summarize this the opinions in this area that the e-cigarette presents a significantly different health risk than a traditional cigarette Senator Connelly is the FDA currently reviewing these products to determine whether or not they should be regulated by the FDA FDA as well they are senator and and that's an important point in 2000 and this was this how would the FDA was going to regulate this was actually subject of a decision by the US Court of Appeals a DC Circuit in December 2010 initially it appeared that the FDA wanted to regulate the electronic cigarette as a medical device under under the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act there was litigation and the end result at least as it currently stands in the decision the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was that the the FDA should regulate these products not as a device but rather like a tobacco product under the family family control arm the what was known as the FDA bill that regulates tobacco however since December 2010 there there has been quite simply pokeberry anticipating regulations to be issued by the FDA but they have not been issued yet but it is expected in accordance with that decision that the FDA will in fact be regulating these products in the same way they regulate tobacco products under the FDA bill well does this legend continue senator thank you doesn't the legislation though exclude any product regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration under Chapter five of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act it does because that's that's the section of the law that covers medical devices or drugs the e-cigarette is already by federal law been determined to not fall into that category but rather falls under the FDA's on smoking Protection Act so then we would not be at risk than if the product does become regulated by the FDA that would essentially the state would essentially lose its ability to implement stricter controls if we determine that was necessary going forward because of that exclusion in the statute right I don't see how that's possible in the reason being is I think that if Rhode Island were to adopt this bill they would actually be ahead of what's going what is likely to occur at the federal level and that is Rhode Island would be treating this electronic cigarette for youth of access purposes as if it was a tobacco product which is exactly what is expected to happen at the federal level it that they're going to be regulated under the FDA's tobacco authorization not under the drug and device offer uh but we do but quite simply this in this provision in this definition that exclusion was intended you know I can tell you what what why that that provision is there it was intended to make clear that nicotine products that have already been approved by the FDA for therapeutic purposes such as nicotine gum and transdermal patches are not inadvertently swept up into the prohibition against of of this particular bill I'm still concerned that it had exactly the opposite effect that language is pretty specific to exclude any product product regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration under Chapter five of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act we should the FDA should the FDA regulations once they're issued do exactly that then the state of Rhode Island essentially lose its ability but but whether the circuit court has or the Circuit Court of Appeals has already said that these products should be regulated under the provisions of what they call the tobacco act which is short in for the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 they've already said at least in that decision that they will not be regulated under the provisions of the federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act so we believe that that cause it's consistent what is with what is the controlling federal court decision in this area and what is what the course of the regulatory of events that should follow what's the FDA issues regulations how we certainly be willing to discuss whether that causes is absolutely necessary I mean if there is a way to say that more precisely um to address that concern and certainly be willing to try to construct language to make that clear Thank You senator Hodgson Thank You chairman on a quick question you mentioned the DC Circuit all right under any other federal circuit courts that are considering this question know it to the best of my knowledge on the precise question of where electronic cigarettes should be regulated for the purposes of federal law it's my understanding that the decision of the DC Circuit Court of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is in fact the operating decision in this particular area as it pertains to regulation of the product at the federal level and so your company is not involved in litigation whether it be in the US district courts or the federal circuit courts elsewhere on the same question because generally in that that is how the legal question is going to be settled when different circuits come up with a different interpretation I can't report that while my company is probably involved in litigation somewhere about something that we we who we have to the best of my knowledge because we haven't entered the marketplace with our product in a national distribution yet I'm not aware of us challenging I will tell you that however what the company what Reynolds is doing is supporting legislation in more than 20 states to include the electronic cigarette in the law prohibiting youth access and in fact in addition to supporting it in more than 20 states we have seen it enacted in three states this year and in in the states that are considering it we're seeing it passed with near unanimous voters in both states regardless of the political complexion it's chairman if I could just follow up certainly senator Hodgson now that we've talked to I think twice now you've said the primary and only purpose of this is to prevent the sale of these devices to minors that's correct on why bring this this hire new unsettled business line into a regulatory scheme of Licensing for tobacco products why don't we just bend it for minors give it a definition I think these definitions are adequate and the ban is adequate why don't we just keep it well to keep it limited to the purpose that you've intended because I haven't heard any any discussion about why we should put this into a licensing and regulatory I think in and if I were to refer to some material that I found on the tobacco control website I think that the license to sell to tobacco products at retail is an important component of the youth tobacco prevention program quite simply if a person is and I think this is why the violation rate is is one of the reasons the violation rate may be as low as it is if a license is at risk it seems that it would behoove a retail store owner who's selling these products not to put that license at risk bike bike selling to minors so the penalty would be equally applicable to to a vendor whether they're part of a licensing scheme or not and so there may well be valid policy arguments to put them into this regulatory scheme but you know one thing that you testify to is that the the constituents of inhaling this is nicotine vapor presents a unique if there's a health hazard is it is unique separate and distinct from that of tobacco touch correct so other than tobacco other than the a common chemical ingredient of nicotine which as I understand it I have to ask my brother the doctor but I understand it that's not you know that's not this severe health risk that we are addressed with tobacco I will agree with you on that so if there are no similar motivations to to regulate regulating II delivery devices and and burned tobacco why would you put them in the same license basically the answer to that is that the licensing structure has been affected we believe that the data shows that it's been effective in keeping tobacco products out of the hands of youth and so we think if it's worked there it can work here sure well let me ask you this another way would you support this bill if we made this simply a ban on providing these devices to youths and left the licensing to follow whether its developments in the federal circuit courts or or FDA action or a more uniform national approach to this climate merging technology I believe that we could because if the core objective here is keeping these products out of the hands of minors and that's and and that's what the bill will do without regard to licensing then then certainly we would we would support that legend that legislation okay are there any other questions or comments for this witness senator Connelly thank you raised in that colloquy now exactly what the product is is it clear then that every product out there marketed as an e-cigarette has either tobacco or nicotine derived from tobacco in it or there are other products out there marketed as cigarettes that do not an e-cigarette as it's commonly understood does not contain any tobacco it contains a liquid it can it is has liquid which contains nicotine which is derived from two packages of tobacco derivative that's correct okay but does not contain nicotine number one and number two you know there's always going to be a complicated answer to a simple question number two there are some manufacturers that that manufacture an electronic cigarette with varying levels of nicotine including no nicotine is that they still call it an e-cigarette but I can't explain that that's not our product and I am just aware that that is out there so then my understanding is and that there products out there being Martha as cigarettes which don't contain the nicotine derivative in it so that the products marketers e-cigarettes are some which would be covered by the definition in this legislation and some which would not well I do quite simply if it doesn't contain nicotine oh and it would not fit within the proposed definition of a vapor product because it's the nicotine that we're trying to keep it's the fact that it contains nicotine that you're trying to keep out of the hands of kids so from an enforcement and from a a vendor perspective how do we go about distinguishing in the legislation the difference between you know those that have the nicotine derivative knows that don't and again assuming a goal is that Senator Hodgson said a moment ago to keep it to keep the product out of the hands of those 18 and under how do we address that in the legislation well you know that's pretty interest I just became aware of the zero nicotine product and it became aware of the zero nicotine product and I am aware that it does it would not be captured because it doesn't contain nicotine in the definition as it's currently written but um I guess then the question becomes is is if it doesn't contain nicotine what's what's the reason to keep it i I don't know what what I don't know what the question is um if it's not covered then it's not caught well wouldn't they at least one possible response to your query be that we don't want that product that is like a cigarette similar to a cigarette to get in the hands of those 18 and under as an entryway to the use of cigarettes isn't that at least one possible you know response to your quote basically the if the prevailing information about these products is that they are used by smokers um to stop it in in in lieu of cigarettes but the point being is I think that if there is a product out there that we need to address that has that's called an e-cigarette but does not contain nicotine then it's possible we make the definition a little bit longer to contain that to include that product if in fact that's what needs to be done but if it doesn't need to if it doesn't contain nicotine the question is does it need to be done senator Connelly then settled on body oh thank you just warm up a limo ironic got one will follow cushion is a slightly different part of the bill senator Archibald if I understand the bill correctly the as I read the bill and if I'm if I'm not reading it correctly please please tell me that it imposes the penalty on the minors for attempting to purchase the tobacco dry product as opposed to the vendor my understanding that correctly actually you are and that is how the law is currently written and as a matter fact that language is that language is verbatim from the statute as it's currently written and senator I think it's important to note that that that particular provision was the subject of legislation in this General Assembly last year which changed it slightly in required tobacco cessation education for minors who were convicted and that bill was vetoed by the governor but this bill as it's currently proposed makes no change to the current penalty for minors who are found in possession or using or attempt to purchase tobacco right so what of acknowledging you are history is being accurate this bill it doesn't change the fact that this bill would not impose any penalty on the seller of the product to the minor oh no it does there are penalty provisions for retailers as well if if you give me a moment correct identify that for me I'm being told that Section B so I'll look at that Thank You mr. Chen Sandlin body Thank You mr. chairman Jack I think that the fact that we're having this discussion seems and I tend to agree with Senator hanshan in the sense that I we have a comprehensive tobacco legislation and we understand the purpose for which that tobacco legislation is passed we now technology has brought us to 2013 and there is this item called a vapor product which I see is being defined as a non combustible tobacco derived product containing nicotine I will say if nothing else I learned one thing tonight and my thought was that all these folks that are trying to quit smoking they tell me it's water in that there's no nicotine base in it at all but but I learned now that but I think that the intent if the intent is to protect children that I agree with the senator that this should be legislation in and of itself in a separate section and we can define out this product containing nicotine as being the so-called bad product and you know let the water cigarette forward where it may or if we decide that you know it's the mere act of puffing that we want to want our children not to embrace then we we embrace that and put that under that same umbrella and senator we certainly happy to work with with this committee the sponsor or other stakeholders to to get to that to get to that point if that's what the approach here was if the federal law was going to regulate these products in the same way tobacco products than what you have offered here is a legislation that follows a similar path if there's a better way to get there it's not how we start it's how we finish and how we want to finish is keeping these products out of the hands of minors are there any other questions or comments for this witness thank you sir [Music] make sure the red buttons up please Thank You chairman committee my name is Steve Bayonne I started a company called Sega team in November of 2008 Rhode Island based company I was actually the first one to introduce this e cigarette or electronic cigarettes who said of rhode island in new england market during that time there's been a lot of uphill battles with you know reynolds and a lot of big tobacco early on and just to kind of clear up some of the licensing issues because we could have saved a lot of time and paper on the extended bill we do agree on the restrictions for 18 year olds and minors I've adopted that since 2008 we have we card signs and we're currently in the process of working with weak heart on you know supporting all our vendors card and it's just been something that we've adopted forever it's on our packaging so we totally agree with that aspect of the bill we truly believe that it should really be a blanket federal regulation this is an opinion on why they would agree on licensing and some of those changes to really just curtail what we've established and in four and a half years because they had no interest in this market they just wanted to really crush this back in um 2008 and you know just for him presenting that abuse which I knew about for years was in production this is just a way involved of setting us back and forcing us to you know to be licensed and kind of you know make the plane feel a little even for them because you know they have a stronghold in a convenience market they don't have an online presence there basically forward five years behind times we were the elephant in the room and now you know they they're ready to you know partner up with us in a sense so we do want to work together on on making this a product you know that that we definitely don't want in the hands of minors but the licensing is just a way of curtailing what we've created the awareness the brand awareness that I I've spent and then you know my employees my vendors are here we spent countless you know hours and then in just years of introducing this and then fighting legislative you know and now they're on board and we're happy you know to see them in a space but the licensing is just it's just a ploy just to you know just just the cause we make it a lot harder for some of the smaller local guys to do business and and you know they've been playing in this field for for many years and we know Anna Hodgson thing was chairman on jachnoon completely unfamiliar with the e-cigarette market and could you tell me a little bit about what that looks like in Rhode Island what are the distribution channels either that you use or you're familiar with and and tell us a little bit how this would impact your business other than having to go apply for a license right the impact wouldn't really exciting I'm sorry just one more question what other products are you selling okay we we only sell and distribute electricity rates we have like he mentioned various nicotine levels so we do have a non nicotine there's no way of distinguishing a non from a high in a sense I mean they are marked and they're labeled but realistically to try to police this this product it's going to take a lot more than you know just a conversation today the electronic cigarette is a alternative to smoking products a lot of our customers actually start with an on nicotine because it's just that the habit is what's hard to really check it's not so much the addictive ingredient in a cigarette it's just the everyday habit so this this kind of curtails it and that's why there's a high success rate with our product the second part of your question again the distribution are you selling these so your distributor yes okay and it wasn't clear from my testimony and you're distributing it to retail yep we have retail locations what what type of businesses are selling this what are your customers look like are they convenience stores are they retail shops is it online can you just give a story we have uh we have online sector which is about 10% of our business we have a specialty retail which we started on Providence Place in Warwick mall we have two locations in there retail specialty means cell which only the carts inside the malls okay we also have a convenience stores as a distribution on Foxwoods casino and MGM carries our product here in New England and we have other states with the same distribution channel okay Thank You him are there any other questions or comments for this witness sent on the body just a quick question because we can't decipher between an on nicotine cigarette and a high nicotine or a medium nicotine are you suggesting that the eighteen you're under eighteen shouldn't have access to any of them no right thank you that's what I thought thank you you can continue and then on top of it in just since 2008 I've employed over sixty people within my company we created a licensing agreements with other various vendors you know current and all sales tax on an offline and it's definitely something you know that that's brought a lot of positive I'm currently I'm originally from New York I moved back about a year and a half ago I kept my company based here in Rhode Island you know what laws like this it's nothing to move it across the board of the Massachusetts or even you know back to New York but that's not something I decided you know two years ago and I left doing great business in the state and you know we hope to continue to create that and again I we were the originators here it's just it's definitely a ploy on licensing and there's a lot more behind the licensing and and the restrictions then then what's stated inside of there so you know it's definitely a control play but we really think you just keep it federally and let the federal government you know handle what they said they were going to handle are there any other questions or comments for this witness thank you next we have Laura Akers okay my name is Laura and I'm the office manager for Sega teen and Providence I've been there for approximately two years I've considered what I could possibly say to you to get you to take a closer look at this bill and reconsider the passage of it or not passing it as it is written and in short at the end of the day this bill is a Trojan horse it looks great it comes in under the guise of we want to keep this product out of those that are under 18 and quite frankly we agree with that we have been doing it as Steve alluded to we the weak hard policy is definitely in effect with our company [Music] but passing the bill as it is written with all of these other things as the lady on the back row mentioned you know why all this other stuff in the bill basically I mean it is to restrict us it is to choke us out and at the end of the day who pays for that who who does that effect it's the Rhode Islanders that are affected by that and the reason is because it's there's a two-fold reason that having worked in this industry that I'm seeing all of our customers have one thing in common and that thing is that they are traditional smokers they have they have smoked cigarettes they've tried everything possible to quit smoking nothing is worked they began to learn about this product they're trying to part of it it works they're stopping smoking they're going to their doctors the doctors are now taking notice because their patients finally are quitting smoking the health of the patients is improving and then the word is beginning to spread now we have doctors calling us wanting to know about the product and are beginning to promote it to their patients because they see that it works and then stop and think about that for a minute and these economic times I will bet that the health care that the state of Rhode Island has to pay for those that can't provide their own health care insurance is sky-high and a huge expenditure in that has to be the coverage that is given to treat smoking related diseases and illnesses so if this bill is passed in the way that it is it's going to choke out electronic cigarette sells from the small companies it becomes more expensive one of the things is the adult signature verification when you send an online shipment that adds $5 to do that and I'm going to come back to that in a minute that adds $5 at that point it becomes cheaper for these people to go back to traditional cigarettes so that's something that to take an effect and then every as one or two of you on the front mention you're just not hearing about electronic cigarettes it is a business that is booming if you look at the records it's showing that this business is doubling in volume on a yearly basis across the board the electronic cigarette industry is with that said this company siga teen sitting here in Rhode Island that could have moved to another state but the owner chose to keep it here it is poison position to become a large contender in the electronic cigarette industry employing lots of people in the state of Rhode Island creating more revenue via sales tax for this for the state of Rhode Island so having said that if this bill passes as it is currently written Szigeti moves out of the state I don't have a job unemployment food stamps and you're paying my health care you know that that's a frightening thought and I'm asking you to please reconsider work with us work with work with electronic cigarette companies get in touch with the people that are residents of this state that will tell you amazing things about the product we all are in agreement we don't want this in the hands of anyone that is under 18 we've already been doing that without being told to do it we've been doing it it's packaged pretty it looks like it's all about don't sell it to those that are under 18 but there's more to this bill and to pass it and as it is written is really not good for the for the residents of Rhode Island at the end of the day it's big tobacco that will benefit if you pass this bill as it's written and we all know what happens all you have to do is look at past history when big tobacco benefits the rest of us were left holding the bag we pay the price for it so please reconsider are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you next we have Patricia Nolan good afternoon and welcome director thank you I'm no longer a director though it's nice to be back in front of you mr. chairman and members I will be brief because many of the concerns that I have have already been raised and quite eloquently by members of the committee as a public health professional and a physician I've strongly supported legislation and policies over the past decade and more to end the use of tobacco entirely it is still the number one preventable cause of death and of many acute and chronic diseases in our state I'm proud of what we all have done and particularly of what the legislature has done to continue to work on those problems my concerns about this bill are similar to those which you've raised I do have a couple of others I would like to mention one is that the bill doesn't although it defines these new products in the taxation section it does not include them under taxation I know the people next to me aren't anxious to do that but I think it's important not to close off your decisions about what will happen to these products as they come on to wide use and we get a better understanding of how they do affect health nicotine is not innocuous that's one of the reasons it's regulated as a prescription drug in many instances and in only controlled amounts when it's being used in patches and gum the the bill does also does not does something that's quite important to us in our ability to keep cigarettes and other products out of the hands of 18 and under I'm sorry under 18 years of age and that is it eliminates our current system of collecting data about those vendors who have been convicted and that interrupts the current system of graduated penalties for repeat endures and that is a very important part of our ability to keep store owners who repeatedly sell to minors from doing that so basically my view is a law that affirms that we do not want tobacco related products in the hands of our young people is an important thing to consider but we don't need these other clauses and provisions in this bill and I feel it would be a mistake to go forward with the bill in the way it is currently presented are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you thank you we do have a number of other witnesses signed up to testify on this bill a number of concerns have been raised by committee members we'll continue with the witnesses Corinna would Susan Roberts Erin Welch Megan Tucker we'll start on it I'll left you're right yes it's the Sun thank you hi I'm Karina Holly Oakwood and I'm the director of the Rhode Island tobacco control Network and I'm coming to testify in opposition to bill 622 I brought me with me a little visual show-and-tell I hope you'll indulge me just for a moment do you recognize this photograph I think everybody here is old enough to recognize it and I'll just show it to the folks behind buddy anybody I took this down from the wall of my offices conference room today because this is the tobacco industry CEOs lying under oath before Congress some years ago that there was no nicotine that they did not know that cigarettes the nicotine in cigarettes was addictive you may remember those famous congressional hearings and I just thought I'd bring it along today because I knew that we were going to be hearing from tobacco industry leaders today lobbyists and representatives here telling you that this bill is really just about prohibiting the sale and use of e-cigarettes and vapor products to youth when really as you've already heard this is a Trojan horse a stalking horse call it what you will it's a bill masquerading as a tobacco prevention strategy and a youth prevention strategy but really as you all have shown that you have very good reading abilities and some common sense and intelligence you have seen that the bill actually is stuffed full of other provisions that pertain to the control the regulation the taxation the definition and I'm not going to continue and raise repeat the points that have already been raised but just to say that my network which represents 50 different organizations statewide health community advocates and I will mention the ones who who specifically put their names on this statement that I gave you today are very much opposed to this bill the American Heart Association Amer can Stroke Association Cancer Action Network American Lung Association campaign for tobacco-free kids the Rhode Island Medical Society the partnership to reduce cancer in Rhode Island the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society the Rhode Island Public Health Institute the March of Dimes and also local prevention coalition's statewide barrington prevention coalition east providence prevention coalition Narragansett prevention coalition partnership and the North Kingstown Prevention Coalition and those are just a few that got in time because we were not fully aware that this hearing was happening till a couple of days ago but I would just urge you to if you want to ban the sale and the use of these products to under-18s let's just have a simple bill that says that that would be fine with us thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you you can proceed good evening this is Susan Roberts I am the director of government relations and advocacy for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network We strongly oppose this bill and its entirety and there are a couple things that we haven't addressed yet that I would like to address and one of those is this bill in its current form can actually prohibit or harm our current cleaner and or Air Act so right now when you go into restaurants you don't have people smoking around you and that's because of your good work you have taken care of your your constituents and within your state and we we praise you for that what we want to see done is to make sure that these products are under regulation by the federal tobacco Drug Administration that they're reviewed to see whether there's harm or not to not only the person that's using these products and not to believe the tobacco industry that's here today presenting but not just the folks that are using the products but those that are around because we don't know yet and the FDA doesn't know yet and that's why we have the FDA in place one of the things I'd like to also bring to your attention is if Big Pharma came into you and said hey we have a drug in the works FDA is reviewing it but hey we're going to go to the states and see if we can go ahead and set up statute to bypass and circumvent FDA that would be wrong and that's what's happening here so they're attempting to circumvent taxes they're attempting to circumvent regulation there they're putting it under the guise of protecting our youth don't buy it it is a longtime tobacco industry tactic please don't buy it I don't think you guys will you've asked a lot of great questions we really appreciate that and we hope that you'll pose this in its entirety one thing I do want to mention also is that there as Karina said we scrambled to get it word out about today and word is just now starting to really trickle in folks that are opposing this that I received information from last night Rhode Island State Nurses Association Leukemia Lymphoma Society chaplain Jim Woolsey the director of Spiritual Care Roger Williams Medical Center Rhode Island Council of Churches they're offended by this Rhode Island partnership to reduce cancer Joyce Staubach a cancer survivor Cheryl McKinney cancer survivor Ryan Bell more cancer caregiver Mary Preble a former smoker who lost one lung she says don't do this dr. Arnold Herman he's the clinical associate professor of surgery surgery at Brown University University he opposes Angela Tabor dr. Taber assistant professor of medicine and assistant program director hematology oncology so there are a lot of people that are hearing about this and they hope that you oppose thank you thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you you could proceed Thank You mr. chairman members of the committee my name is Megan Tucker I'm with the American Heart Association we are also opposed to this bill and for the sake of time I would just echo the comments of my colleagues and thank you very much thank you we appreciate your brevity are there any questions or comments thank you you can proceed oh good well I'll try and beat that my name is Erin bull's Welsh I'm the tobacco control manager for the Department of Health and I'm here on behalf of director dr. fine who regrets that he can't be here himself we respectfully oppose this bill is written although we wholeheartedly support the sponsors effort to ban these products from youth if an amendment were to be proposed we would certainly work to review that with the sponsor with the committee and advocates to ensure that such language would most directly address this issue and other than that we appreciate your in-depth consideration of this piece of legislation so thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness senator Archibald thank you sir chairman been listening patiently and I have to thank my my brother who always brings up great points and my sister and the other senators who are now out of the room for asking questions that discern between banning the use of these products on people under the age of 18 and the entirely different realm of uncertainty that we seem to be into on this unstable piece of proposed legislation where the FDA doesn't have any certainty so it seems to me to be something that not only is perhaps not entirely well thought out but something that could have some very very serious consequences health-wise and I really do get the intent of a Trojan horse coming in here and I I'm trying to really keep my mind objective but unconvinced it that this thing is shouldn't really be before us at this point and back to Senator hatch and I he kept going back to can't you just separate this and make it about banning these products for people 18 or younger and I didn't hear that question frankly adequately answered or over how articulate you were sir I didn't hear that that question answered sometimes the the loftiest questions can be answered in the simplest form and I didn't hear that answer so I really don't think this frankly should be before us are there any other comments or questions thank you the next group of witnesses we have a Rick McAuliffe Kerala Kerala frisk Angela Tabor dr. Arnold Herman Mary Preble we have a number of people signed up who are testifying who's here to testify on behalf of this bill against will come forward what do we do it that way and we're going to start with you mr. McAuliffe and getting a goal Thank You mr. chairman and members of committee I will be extremely brief because I know you've heard it from all sides I just make one comment Senator Archambault said that this bill was not thought out very well that's no it can't be a further from the truth this bill is a ruse this bill was directly used to set up future products in Rhode Island to not be taxed and to have to go every year to define a product to tax a product and so forth Big Tobacco does not come up from California lino because they're concerned about making sure that kids under 18 don't use this product this product costs over $100 to buy the kit there's not many kids that can afford that product this bill is used to set up and create different categories while it doesn't specifically mention taxation what it does do is it does bring forth different categories so every time something is introduced it would have to come back to the legislature whether it's a tax it or not it's no secret that tobacco is losing market share in terms of people that are smoking we've seen our revenue for tobacco decreased 50% in the last 10 years part of that reason is because you have taken action on higher tax on cigarettes the fact of the matter is we will now have a situation where when products come in they are going to be creating new electronic products electronic cigarettes and so forth obviously they're able to do that our concern quite frankly is that the intention of this bill was not to make sure that those under 18 don't use electronic cigarettes rather the bill was written to open up a hole to allow definitions of different products make no mistake about it as many attorneys up here much than I if you read this bill it creates separate categories which would allow every year for products to be introduced into the marketplace which won't be taxed which won't be categorized as tobacco unless you make that so while this legislation on the surface and Senator Hutchison's was completely right if it was just a simple bill to be in people under 18 to not use electronic cigarettes I don't think there's anyone in the room that would oppose this but the legislation wasn't intended for that reason this legislation was intended to drive a hole through this these are people who are very very good at what they do but the fact of the matter is this legislation is too big it's too broad and I was asked for your support to look at the bill and hopefully you can work with everyone to make it what it should be which is the ban electronic cigarettes for anyone under 18 years old thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you you can proceed okay hear me okay my name is Lisa Chelonia and I live in Pawtucket Rhode Island and I've provided you a copy of a study that our as evidence that electronic cigarettes let me read it there is no existing evidence that youth and nonsmoker are using this product okay how about we start off don't over again sorry I respectfully oppose bills six twenty two and five eight seven six in its current form because I it poses extreme regulations to electronic cigarettes even though there is no evidence that non-smokers you use e cigs electronic cigarette companies and retailers support laws that be on sales to minors however one a one-page bill would be a sufficient gold would be sufficient to achieve this goal sorry more than twenty states have been the sales to electronic cigarettes to minors without making retailers in their customers subjected taxation laws such as the extreme regulations also the definitions the definitions of product derived tobacco derived product and vapor product contradict each other as the definition of tobacco derived product says it doesn't include a vapor product while vapor product definition says it must be a tobacco dried product the definition of vapor product in these bills also exempts the majority of e-cigarette products now on the market but determining which products will actually be covered by this definition of vapor products could result in years of conflict controversy and probably litigation plus not all electronic cigarettes contain nicotine regulations would force us sorry these regulations would force Rhode Island electronic cigarette retailers and businesses out of business because it requires them to obtain the tobacco license with the requirement they cannot only purchase they can only purchase their products from licensed wholesalers and distributors even though many electronic cigarettes retailers manufacturers in sorry cigarette Rita electronic cigarette retailer retailers manufacturers and importers directly market their product to consumers Rhode Island consumers this would deny Rhode Island ISA consumers from purchasing the best majority of products now available on the market because they aren't going to be sold by tobeco dealers in Rhode Island this bill would also increase unnecessary cost both to the retailer and the consumer by adding it as a tobacco product to be taxed as such by rakaat sorry by requiring a government-issued ID and adult signature with every online order on shipment this will also make it impossible for the people who already use these products such as myself in the state of Rhode Island to legally purchase what they need to continue being tobacco free I see this as a direct threat to the consumers and the public health in Rhode Island especially when millions of people including myself have successfully stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes due to the fact that ecigs work and because these products are available to them by restricting the ecig users from getting what they need to keep them free from smoking tobacco cigarettes is a real crime here I urge you to reject sorry I urge you to recheck the bub for the public health of Rhode Island and for the people who use these products like myself to stay smoke-free are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you good evening and welcome hi my name is Spike Bob and I am president of national vapors club we're an e-cigarette consumer organization and we protect the rights of people who use e-cigarettes to continue not smoking I had a couple of things I wanted to say obviously most of them are already covered this is my 27th a cigarette hearing to either ban or stop or stop indoor use or whatever with these cigarettes so I just want to take briefly that it's really nice to see legislators who are reasonably intelligent and competent and are able to read a bill for what it is because I'm really tired of having to explain it to people right now there are over a hundred people in Oklahoma about two hours ago fighting this same legislation by Reynolds American and I expect that they will come out the same way we will briefly I just want to show you what electronic cigarettes look like they do not all look like cigarettes they look very different all of them look different hookah Zi pipe see whatever they do not produce a smell they do not make any smoke we've already gone over that so I'm not going to give you too much more of that there are two studies that I gave to them two hand T one of them there was not enough copies of but I will bring back enough copies when you try to pass an indoor band that says these cigarettes cannot be used indoors because that study is one that I am an author on and that study shows that e-cigarettes do not produce smoke and do not produce the components that are in smoke so we'll worry about that when that bill comes up because I'm sure that it will in the meantime in reference to this bill 622 there are two federally approved age verification systems that you can use online that you can send your ID to them and they approve you and all you have to do is then when you go to buy something online that you need to be age verified for that you can get approved there are only two of them supposedly that are recognized by the federal government but you can use them for online purchases when you're over 18 you have to first send them identification to go through a whole process and once you're approved you purchase these items through this website that allows you to say yes this person is approved that they're over 18 it might be an option for some way to restrict online sales to people who are over 18 obviously national vapors club fully supports sales to people only who are over 18 people who use e-cigarettes oftentimes are sick they've had emphysema they've had COPD they have difficulty breathing they have a lot of health issues they may not be able to come to the door to sign for a package that comes to their door this is a big concern for us because our members say well what if I'm not home what if I can't get up what if I can't get out of my chair what if I'm on my oxygen tank and I can't go to the door how will I get my e-cigarette liquid these people cannot smoke their doctors have told them you cannot smoke you must not smoke you're on oxygen you'll explode yourself if you fight a cigarette while you're on oxygen they don't have the ability to go out to a store and go by you say they have to be at home they're homebound or they're bound to wherever they're hot whatever hospital they're in they need to be able to purchase their electronic cigarette supplies or they go back to smoking many of them do we don't want to see that happen obviously so when this bill is amended and hopefully eventually passed to restrict sales to minors please bear in mind that people need to be able to access the product adults who are smoked former smokers need to be able to have easy access to the product because it's a lot easier to go to the corner store and buy a pack of cigarettes and you don't want to see that happen it also needs to be something that's less cost prohibitive to the vendors I know $5.00 does not seem like a large amount when you're saying oh it's only $5 for adult age verification or adult signature required but that's a lot of money when the person is buying an $8 refill package and they have to pay $5 for adults are occasionally and that's not fair to the user because a lot of people use it because they're on Social Security because they're on disability because they have health problems and they can't afford cigarettes so that's also something that has to be kept in mind and please keep that in mind when you do pass taxation laws on electronic cigarettes while we do understand that you're losing a lot of money state wise for not having people smoke anymore bear in mind that a healthier product deserves a lower tax because people have to be encouraged to use it instead of smoking cigarettes I think that's pretty much all I have to say so I'll leave it at that and with any questions are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you sure hi mr. chairman senators my name is Lou del sasso I just recently opened historical ecig shed in Banton Rhode Island we've been open about eight weeks we sell electronic cigarettes like this you know stuff like that liquids to put them in 24 milligrams 18 11 and 0 I've been finding a lot of people come to the my shop it's like I'm actually the manager my mozi honor but unwanted running the place and they just tried everything they've tried Nicorette gum the tried chantix had bad reactor to chantix at bad reactions with the patch can't quit smoking they come here this is like almost like a last resort inside I didn't want try electronics but I got to give it a shot and they come back from there just amazed and it's smoked in weeks and weeks and weeks it's actually I'm surprised we're doing so well so soon you know it's and I'm really afraid that this SP six to two is going to put a stop to all that it's going to shut me down I'm afraid that it's going to limit what I can bring into the store to help not only myself make a living help my family but also help people get off cigarettes I mean cigarettes almost killed my fellows killed me it smoked two packs a day two years ago I got the flu ended up getting bronchitis turned into pneumonia and the doctor says if you didn't come a few know if you stayed a few more days at home just hack in with that pneumonia I would have died and he said it was from the two packs a day smoking so I feel really strong about e-cigarettes this style that style whatever you want you know look at what an e-cigarette is it pretty much saved my life and if it comes to an end a lot of people are going to be going back to cigarettes then it's going to hurt them that so it comes down to are there any questions or comments for this witness senator Archibald excuse me what do you think makes the e-cigarette work so well gentlemen business owner earlier it stated that it's the habit over the actual physical addictive properties those were creatures of habit what you can amplify on that I mean that things work so that's part of it I mean so you know the nicotine's are no thing they're looking for but you know at the point you know I start off in 24 milligrams work my way down to a 18 down to 12 now I'm at about 10 10 milligrams I don't we keep on working my way down to zero and eventually it's just the oral fixation thing you know I mean as everybody knows it's hard just to go cold turkey it is a way to you know get down while you're enjoying it and then get down to zero that's what a lot of people doing I'm bringing more and more zeros because that's what people are doing they want you know at first I only had a few zeros you know zero milligram liquids you know all different flavors and now I'm just buying more and more and more because that's what people want to do they want to just get off nicotine and it's working for them it really is now that the patch didn't work for me the gum didn't work for me chantix made me crazy you know so yeah I mean it was nuts it's the only thing that works for me two years ago I mean I was a two pack a day smoker the day I started it was a little bit more like a cigarette looking thing there's a cheap one from Walmart a day of started it's been two years the day I started that's quit smoking tobacco it really works yeah are there any other questions or comments for this witness thank you thank you does anyone else wish to speak on this bill with that Senator body moves to hold for further studies seconded by Senator Nestle Bush all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills held for further study the next bill will do with Senator with Jay Rios bill bill number 493 we have a number of witnesses here to speak on 493 patty octo Gail wolf Tim Duffy and Hillary Davis you can proceed miss davyss Thank You chairman members of the committee you have our written testimony in front of you in support of this legislation and so I won't spend your time rehashing it but I do want to just talk about a couple of things social media as we all are well aware is becoming more and more ubiquitous amongst all of us and unfortunately what we're seeing nationwide is that they're becoming more and more situations in which individuals are being required by their employers or by their schools or their potential employers or potential schools to disclose certain social media information sometimes that includes being required to give over their passwords other times it includes being required to log in to their social media accounts in the presence of an employer or a school official the bill that's in front of you would restrict those instances and make sure that individuals private social media rights are protected now I want to make it clear that this applies to individuals where an individual social media is password protected so if something is public and individual any individual can see it but if an individual has chosen to password protect that account for whatever reason they cannot be compelled to give over access to their employer or to their school we're seeing legislation pop up all over the country it's currently in four states in different forms I know it's been introduced in others and just to give you a we have some examples in Oklahoma a police department was requiring applicants to turn over their Facebook passwords as part of a background check in New York there was a statistician who I believe sued because his password information was being required as part of his job schools around the country requiring student athletes to friend or connect with their coaches in a number of other situations this bill will allow employers to access the social media account when there is some suspicion of wrongdoing in a couple of situations but otherwise largely protects individuals password information from being productive I can answer any questions do you have any questions or comments for this witness I know what other people signed up to testify and on their sign-up sheets they indicated they may be at other hearings in the building as well as they have some suggested changes to the legislation when I asked them maybe you sit down with them to try and work out some of those differences with that settlement body moves to hold for further study second by Senator Archibald all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills help for further study the next bills will do a bill number for 68 and 655 one is by son of the Fogerty that deals with background checks and the other is by Senator Miller and it deals with background checks we have number of people signed up to testify on the bills Joey led back of the Department of the Attorney General Paul Valletta of the Ryland State Association of firefighters and Hilary Davis of the ACLU good evening and welcome Paul Thank You mr. chair members of the committee Paul Valletta with the Rhode Island State Association of firefighters were against 468 we're not against background checks for firefighters who come into the fire service we understand checking with our law enforcement brethren that even police officers have to have a legitimate law enforcement reason to do background checks if this legislation were to be passed that would leave it wide open that background checks could be done at any time of firefighters I worked for a mayor a few years back if this law was in place that'd be a background check done on firefighters every week so we're not against background checks we're just against the broadness of this legislation that they can be done editing time and not being a law enforcement person or a lawyer my question is why would you need if if that's frowned upon BCI checks done at any time why would you need legislation put in now that that gives you the right to do it so I I believe talking to my law enforcement brother and today that you just can't run BCI checks just to run then there has to be a legitimate reason thank you are there any questions or comments from mr. Valletta Center Lombardi just to comment and unrelated I'm going to digress the Valletta I just want to thank you publicly on behalf of the citizens of Cranston for what you and all the other bargaining units have done in exercising your discretion in making sure that the pension system will remain viable in the city of Cranston and saving millions of dollars I applaud your group on all the groups and may have fun as well thank you very much are there any other questions or comments thank you miss Davis Thank You chairman our opposition to 468 is similar to what you've just heard we're very concerned with the breadth of the legislation for a number of reasons which are laid out in our written testimony we believe that this will supersede current law and actually allow for arrest records in addition to actually allowing not only for fire departments to get background checks on all of their employees and volunteers but actually any individual who's working within that municipality in any in any circumstance so we are concerned with the breadth of this legislation 655 is an attempt to make uniform the background check statutes that have been passed by the General Assembly over the past several years we're seeing more and more background check statutes come out of come out of the Statehouse and in a number of circumstances the one we were currently talking about being a good example that they're not providing any sort of guidance or or any sort of rules and regulations as to how background checks should go should be performed so all of this legislation does is seek to make uniform those background check policies and procedures I'm aware of the Attorney General's concerns and we're happy to work with their office in regard to the long term nursing care facilities and the fingerprint storage but otherwise we support that legislation thank you thank you were there any questions or comments from miss Davis thank you Miss Len Becker Thank You chairman my comments are related to 655 only we have two problems they know that miss Davis has already addressed them the first one is that this would transfer the the cost of the background check from the applicant to either the attorney general's office the state police or the municipality where the background check is conducted that's impossible for us to properly budget the attorney general's office has about 150 people come in the door a day for background checks half of that is an immediate FBI pass through the other half goes into an escrow account so we think it's appropriate that that cost be left to the applicant and finally is the rat back element of our national background check grant that the chair actually sponsored for the Attorney General that would conflict with that so I'm happy that miss Davis and the ACLU are willing to work with us so we're willing to work with them too on both issues thank you any questions or comments for this witness thank you with that the senator good work I mean senator Nessa Busch moves to halt for the study seconded by Senator Akshar ball all in favor signify by saying aye aye opposed the bills Helfer further study senator good when I you have a bill bill number 548 we're always ready for you 548 and bill 699 deal with graffiti 699 also may not be your bill but it's on the same subject sent on a body but the red button up please to me mr. chairman this is a extremely important bill I'm sure that all of you can see the increase in properties that have been defaced by graffiti primarily in the city of Providence it's growing in leaps and bounds but I see too that it's seeping into some of the suburban areas where traditionally we didn't see it it's extremely frustrating mr. Jim and I hope that this bill aims it directing some an additional tool for law enforcement to help curb this problem quite frankly mr. chairman and I'll say it the bill if I had my way would be a lot a lot more harsh but with that being said the bill seeks to do make for major changes to the current graffiti lures first the bill would require restitution to the victim currently there is not any restitution that is required under the current law secondly it would include imprisonment as an option third when the damages over $1,000 the crime is elevated to a felony and fourth when the perpetrator is a minor there could be three following things that may be done at judicial discretion in the family court it may require a written apology to the property owner secondly the minor or his parent or legal guardian his or her may be held responsible for restitution to the damage that they caused and lastly and this is done in other areas in the country mr. chairman members of the committee the family court may if they decide order a suspension of the minors license or learner's permit for up to one year I really think that by enacting laws such as this we can send a message that it really just serves no purpose these individuals running around the facing businesses where people work really hard and they're even starting on private property it's really sad trust me mr. chairman if these people are caught and could be imprisoned you know for a lifetime throw away the key that'd be fine nobody in my community would miss me miss them believe me good riddance to them are there any questions or comments nlm body just to piggyback on the whips comment the 6.99 is the companion bill to it I feel the same way my language while the whips language is graffiti my language is vandalism same thing it's just it's a it's just a nonsensical behavior by people that destroy people's property and it's reprehensible it's happened to my property on Broadway it's happened to beautiful homes on Broadway it's moving into the you absolutely right it's moving into the suburbs it's happening everywhere and I think this kind of behavior has to have a certain bite to it and you know a little slap on the wrist is just not enough that these people are found to end convicted for this there should be some ramifications and my my penalties kind of mirror what the the whips of penalties would be under her graffiti statue you know that they treated over 1500 its treated as a felony and all the ramifications of a felony take place thank you we do have some witnesses Michael DeLauro Joey LED Beck and Hillary Davis of the ACLU and we'll start with you Joey thank you very much chairman the Attorney General is in strong support of both pieces of legislation we do think that these are true victim crimes both on commercial properties and residential properties we think that the both pieces of legislation will serve as a deterrent and the restitution factor that both bills provide is essential to making our victims whole and making our communities whole are there any questions or comments for this witness Thank You mr. DeLauro good evening and welcome Thank You mr. chair members of the committee in light of the written testimony that we provided you I'll keep my comments brief I'll also say that it's unusual that my comments really apply to all the legislation I'll be testifying about tonight senator Velasquez bill on mens rea ax etc I think this committee knows that we've this session I've devoted a lot of hour in legislative energies to the question of over criminalization we think legislation such as this is a step in the wrong direction and I'll give you an example the court already possesses the power to impose a condition of restitution in cases and I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a case that I could tell you about where a judge being made aware of the fact that someone who committed one of these crimes misdemeanor crimes had and there was a victim who put forth the damage to their property I can't think of a case of a judge would not order restitution in that that case where it becomes counterproductive I think is that it is more expensive to prosecute felony cases then than misdemeanors that these are currently misdemeanor offenses its costlier to retain counsel the core costs are higher the resources that are committed are higher so for the reasons that we've been talking about this entire session as well as those in my letter that are specific to this bill we oppose this legislation I'd be happy to answer any questions are there any questions centered on the body might just two points one the concern about hiring a lawyer for felony versus a misdemeanor I think they should have thought about that before they vandalize the property with all due respect and and secondly and more importantly I think the restitution system in the courts right now I mean it's like you know you know it's a little fun but the tasteless joke the Polish lottery you get a dollar a year for a million years you know you know so so I mean the restitution if someone's going to pay you five bucks a week or five twenty five bucks a month or something like that they'll never get made whole in that situation I think we need a bite in this area I think it's truly victim there were victims here and it's truly senseless behavior are there any other questions or comments Thank You senator Lynch moves to Hopa for the study second by Senator Hachi ball all in favor signify by saying aye aye opposed it builds health for further study the next bill will do is build number four one three senator Adriano mr. Jatin and I welcome Santa thank you very much mr. chairman and members of the committee I appreciate your your input on this piece of legislation I'll be I'll be very brief I know you've been going at this awhile yet a long long session here essentially this came about from input from a constituent who is a 20 year veteran of the Middletown police force and for the last several has been the officer / prosecutor for the Middletown and through conversations with members of his department eventually he brought the concern and just something that he'd seen in his in his routine practice what was going through his department we I sat down with Senator de palma and officer during and even thankful thanks to mrs. Lynn back for the attorney general's office we tried to craft something and again being very brief if you look at this this bill essentially the one piece that we're changing here is on a lot lines 11 12 and 13 where this petty misdemeanor becomes a misdemeanor and and I think that it's certainly deserving of it of officer during elaborated on the high frequency that this is that this is occurring in the community and obviously a 1-1 point of argument that we haven't checked on yet is I haven't gotten any input admittedly from victims rights groups with regard to domestic violence what would certainly welcome some the other part that I'm hoping to get some information from the committee as well as input is if you focus on lines four through seven one thing that officer during pointed out very clearly is that technology has changed since this legislation was drafted and my understanding is that this legislation particularly is quite old so without a lot of legal training that admittedly we tried to come up with something but I fill things as a weakness and how do we get up to date with the technology in terms of cell phones versus party lines which I don't think many people even understand anymore so my request of you is potentially looking into the future if you hold this for further study that we we look at updating the piece of legislation and looking at increasing this to a misdemeanor thank you very much thank you based on Senator Ariana's requests on lunch moves to Hofer for the study second by sentinel body all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills help for further study thank you very much the next bill will do with Senator Velasquez bill bill number 4 1 4 we have a number of people signed up to testify we have Michael DeLauro Mike Stenhouse and Giovanni shitty own Joey led back Michael DeLauro Thank You mr. chairman members of the committee as I mentioned previously much of our efforts this year are devoted to addressing the problem of over criminalization we think it's a fairness issue we think it's an allocation of resources issue this piece of legislation which was submitted at the end of the I remember correctly at the end of the session last year emanates from an organization called the smart on crime coalition which is coordinated by the Constitution project they it says in there the executive summary of their report that I gave you that the Swarna crime coalition brings together unlikely allies experts and practitioners from across the political spectrum in order to promote and safeguard America's Founding Charter and while of course that's extraordinarily important to us it is also an issue of dollars and cents and in fairness as well again I gave you the executive summary the entire report is about 320 pages it's available online I didn't want to give you all of that but I would invite you to look at it online if you look at the the table of contents you'll see that the recommendations of this group are comprehensive and are really across the spectrum of the criminal justice system and although they are in many respects applicable only to the federal system they are also some of our are applicable to issues that we are seeing in Rhode Island and in the other states as well if you look at some of the issues some of them have already been dealt with by this body several years ago Senator Joe Boras legislation regarding according interrogations legislation that was put in by Senator Metz and others I can't recall senator Perry regarding mistake and eyewitness identification come under the innocence issues in Chapter six of this report of course indigent defense the quality of that near and dear to my heart is dealt with in Chapter seven reentry something that we've been talking about all session in chapter 14 and of course this bill which would essentially incorporate as I understand it a mens rea a component into rhode island criminal law that the let that legislation comes out of the same chapter that inspired us to do the over criminalization legislation that chair McCaffrey was kind enough to put in for us and that we discussed earlier was heard earlier this session so I we believe that this is a step in the right direction it is a clearly would make our system more cost-efficient make it more fair and certainly be a better allocation of resources what that'd be happy to answer any questions you might have are there any questions or comments from mr. DeLauro thank you you can proceed mr. chairman committee members my name is Mike Stenhouse I'm the CEO of a public policy think-tank in Rhode Island the Rhode Island Center for freedom and prosperity my role simply to provide a little national perspective is a mr. DeLauro alluded to or part of a national network of think tanks and this type bill is making its way through a lot of states fueled by reports we put our policy brief today which which I think you have in your in your packet on this there this is a the issue of mens rea or criminal tight is not a typical Democrat Republican red state blue state issue it cuts across political boundaries and fairness in fact fourteen states have very similar language like this I mean you look at you can look at blue states like Hawaii Illinois in Oregon and red states like Alaska Kansas and Texas all have very similar provision so what we're talking about here is nothing radical nothing unique it's supported by conservatives such as former turn generals edwin meese and asa hutchinson and it's also supported by a lot of civil libertarians including generally the ACLU on a national basis and the general concept so again this is a this is a policy not about letting violent criminals or career criminals off the hook and considering this issue just consider that it's a it's a part of a national movement to strengthen our criminal justice system and if I may mr. chairman we've got a pinch-hitter today mr. Suzy on how to go early so in his place a Rob coupe we'll talk a little more detail are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you good evening and welcome sir Thank You mr. chairman and committee members my name is Robert coupe I'm speaking on behalf of the center for freedom and prosperity and I just like to talk a little bit more about the rationale behind this why so4 one for it's our belief that no person should be convicted of a crime without the government establishing and proving some level of intent to violate the law and to establish that the person who is being charged with the crime had some knowledge that the conduct was unlawful we're looking to protect citizens from unjust punishment and from ambiguous or vaguely worded criminal statutes the mens rea or the criminal intent provisions are a traditional method to ensure that a citizen is not charged a convicted of a crime that was committed unknowingly or without sufficient intent we certainly do have plenty of strict liability crimes but it's incumbent upon the legislature to identify those crimes in creating the statutes that set out the the various standards for violation of the crime and what this does is in the absence of a mens rea a standard it requires that there be some level of intent in the absence of language in a statute setting out the crime as mr. Stenhouse said there are 14 states already with similar provisions in response to the various statutes in those states that were lacking in terms of a definition of mens rea are required as a component of criminal statutes doing this would as mr. DeLauro said not only protect citizens from unjust criminal charges or convictions but would also allow our law enforcement in our courts to refocus their resources on those who intend to commit crimes and focus on removing either the incentive or removing those people from the from the public so they can no longer be a threat to the public I'm going to stop here I'm going to thank you for your time and I'd be happy to answer any additional questions are there any questions or comments first witness thank you Joey Thank You chairman very much the Attorney General is in strong opposition to this legislation it is our point of view that legislation of this nature would basically abolish general intent crimes in the state Rhode Island in the 200 years of case law behind them and when I speak to general intent crimes I want to point them out to the committee because I know we've heard about unjust criminal convictions who for people they didn't mean to commit them or didn't know and in this state that includes simple assault under state versus proud it includes assault with a dangerous weapon under State vs prowl it includes rape and first-degree sexual assault under state versus Evo domestic felony assault and violating a no-contact under order under state v throw Rotten Breaking and Entering under state vs. jamya Jeremiah just to name a few so I think when we look towards changing the mens rea elements required of the case of the laws that you have put on the books and the courts have interpreted for the last 200 years we need to take a very serious look at what we're actually unraveling here are there any questions or comments in the body Thank You mr. chair and this can go out to either Joey Otto Mike I'm I'm a little perplexed how so wouldn't assault what a dangerous weapon or a rape charge or anything of that nature suggest that that's not a mens rea of crime by its own definition Mike that's a good question I have to ponder that one a little bit even a broken clock is Right twice a day no off to get back to I don't want us to think about and give us a written response as well as you also Joey on that issue we will chairman thank you certainly discernment if I could jump in here the intent we have a long tradition in the US and in Rhode Island law in fact refers to the long tradition of common law standards in our traditional criminal offenses there are certainly high-risk conducts that are defined by the common law as being illegal in the common law over 200 years has established mens rea requirements we're talking about a different class of criminal conduct criminal conduct that has come about more recently than some of the common law standards just a couple of examples from Rhode Island law it is a it is an offense in Rhode Island to use the term fresh eggs when selling eggs how does this apply to a farm stand for example of that selling eggs that were laid within a day and and and that farmer sells them as fresh eggs there's another offense it is an offense to own a billiard table without a license again a restaurant or a bar puts it puts a pool table in the back room is that the kind of conduct that we want to punish with criminal sanctions without our General Assembly at least identifying it as a strict liability crime one more example I'll put out for you is it is an offense to sell Footwear which has been imported from a foreign country without notifying each person purchasing or intending to purchase that Footwear that it has been imported again my wife has sold shoes on eBay is she committing a criminal offense in Rhode Island those are the kind of things we're talking about we'd be happy to work with the attorney general's office to ensure that there's language in this bill that we're not looking to go out and overturn hundreds of years of common law standards but I think we do have to look at these regulatory economic type of criminal offenses and make sure we intend to subject people to criminal liability for that conduct Thank You senator haja ball thank you sir I understand senator own body's question to you to Mike about the general intent crime and how you sincerely all of us would have to struggle with there is no easy answer to that I think the interplay between my concern when I was first listening to you was what about general intent crimes they could be caught up in this I respect the spirit of what you're trying to do because as a prosecutor as a defense attorney and having grappled with the definition of intent in certain statutes without listening some of those more archaic ones but the more practical ones that we deal with on it on a daily basis and trying to flesh out whether the individual really had the mens rea ax I think the spirit of what you're trying to do is very sound in terms of getting rid of a whole process if you will of outdated thinking my concern would be though catching up all these general intent crimes in that sweep so I'm sure in a second we make a motion hold first light but I really respect what the Attorney General is trying to say about going too far with general intent crimes here and I think it's something that you know your honor the right thing but I think it needs more work so it's not so broad that you throw the baby out with the bathwater you know thank you at this time I'm going to suggest that mr. doe mr. Lyne Beck work with these gentlemen to address some of the concerns I think the crimes they're talking about a crimes that probably shouldn't even be on the books nowadays see if we can maybe work to get rid of some of those you maybe come back with a sub a at some point in time in the future Sinhala body moves to home for further study seconded by Senator Joe Bora all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills held for further study the next next bill we're going to do is bill number four bill number four 19 as part of the requested Department of Human Services we do have Sharon Santilli here to speak on behalf of the bill 619 I'm sorry that Senator Nashville Bush's bill Thank You mr. chairman I'll simply introduce Ms Santilli and she can explain exactly what the bill would do it would help obviously with child child support enforcement Thank You senator mr. chairman members of the committee my name is sharon Santilli i'm here in my capacity as the child support director with the Department of Human Services office of child support services I support this bill last year just to give you an idea the agency collected eighty eight million dollars in child support eighty five percent of which went directly to families so we are definitely a safety net we represent one third of income to low income families and we have many tools at our disposal we have automated locate tools and enforcement tools to collect past you support and of course to locate on parents for service of process but we need all of the tools that other states are using successfully and this is one of the tools that many states are using cell phone companies have verified addresses this particular bill would make it very clear that cell phone companies are subject to the exchange of information electronically and that's what we need to do we have approximately 57,000 cases currently and about 10,000 919 of those cases are in locate status if we do not have a verified address for a noncustodial parent we can't serve them to appear at court to establish in order and we can't serve them for any notice so we we currently have the ability under the administrative subpoena law of 15 22 3 to actually issue administrative subpoenas but for for our purposes that would mean that in the ten thousand cases I just mentioned we would have to issue about seven subpoenas per case it would cost us about twenty seven thousand dollars just to issue those subpoenas not to mention the the time and resources staff resources to collect that information and update it on our system so this bill would allow us to collect that information electronically like we do with many other pieces of information from various companies so we I would urge you to support this bill this I believe is the fifth year that it's been before the committee and I also believe we've addressed the ACLU concern last year of tracking in Section G happy to answer any questions or any questions or comments for this witness senator Lombardi Meuse passage seconded by Senator Nestle Bush all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bill is passed thank you so much next bill will do was when we start with bill number 221 is there anyone here to speak on Hill number 221 by Senator Doyle senator Lombardi moves that we hope for the study seconded by Senator de Bourgh all in favor signify by saying aye aye opposed the bills help of further study the next two bills will do a bills number for 67 and 660 by Senator Archibald you want to briefly explain your bill and that bill number was 660 is by me senator Roger ball certainly chair I was asked by triple-a to put this bill in and after taking a look at what they were trying to do I saw that there was a an issue that I had this bill would require essentially that parents would attend classes with their children when they're learning how to drive and I said well the spirit of it sounds good but who's going to pay for it I said I don't think the parents should be required to pay for it if there's already a course going on that would make other people who have to attend the program not pay for it so there's language in there it says there shall be no cost or fee required to take this course of instruction with that I I thought it was a sound bill to be able to have parents involved with their children when they're learning to drive driving is one the danger most dangerous things we all do every day so that's why I put it in are there any questions for the sponsor we do have a couple people signed up to testify in the bills Bob rockeo and Anthony Silva I built 660 also we're doing 660 also a wish bill you are now we're doing both of them together sure thank you thank you what's up Margaret whoever wants to go first okay stop Thank You mr. chair members of the committee I am testifying on bill six six zero which would add distracted driving issues including cell phone use to be tested as part of our general knowledge examination for the issuance of a license it's a good thing to do we think it's a good thing to do with DMV and in addition I believe I'm not sure if it's Araki was testifying on this but I I've been told that it would provide them some assistance with grants and things of that nature therefore we're in favor of it Thank You mr. chair are there any questions for this witness thank you sir yes i bob rockeo representing the department transportation and this this proposed bill would make us eligible to receive special texting grant funds and while the driver's license examinations that the DMV give do have questions on texting and driving that is in itself not enough it's this new transportation bill map-21 requires in addition to that that a they must be reading written in the state law that that happened because current practice can change and that would ensure that current practice require additional hours of schooling for the in the driver's ed program but no it's are currently its current practice so it would just codify in law that what's already happening okay and on senator dodge ball on your bill some people have multiple children who began licenses at the same time would you have to take that class all the time I would hope not that would be a that's a good question I would think that if you had multiple children I have to take the bill if your that's a great question mr. chair I know I'm going to senator Archibald move passage of his bill seconded by Senator Lombardi and he's going to look to see about an amendment to address that issue with a parent has multiple children second by Senator de Bourgh well in favor signify by saying aye aye opposed the bill passes with respect to bill number six six zero sinhala body Moo's passage second by senator lynch while a favor signify by saying aye aye opposed the bill passes the next two bills we'll do a bill number six 59 and 661 thanks ya bill six five nine is a simple bill it would just update the section 31 thirteen six of the general laws two to change the definitions of traffic control devices for three reasons there are some arcane references in here as you might see refers to it describes what to do when a traffic signal says go or stop or caution I don't think we've had those type signals in existence for a while secondly it makes the language more consistent with the national uniform vehicle code book and most pressing is that it provides a definition for a new type of traffic signal indication which is the flashing yellow arrow and I do have oh I forgot it I'm sorry if you want to see I do have a poster boy showing the new phasing and that phase reason we went to that is the manual uniform traffic control devices national standard now allows this type of phase Ingush when you have a left turn Bay with what we call protected protected permissive signal phasing where the motor sunette left turn lane would get a green indication currently and then it would go to a green circular indication there have been instances around the country where our motorists don't understand that it's not as instictively understand that and they have they assume they have the right away and they take a left across oncoming traffic and this would change that by as opposed to once you have the green arrow it would go to a steady yellow arrow to indicate that the green phase is terminating you no longer have a protected left turn movement it goes to a flashing yellow which just reinforces studies show simulations in actual world tests are railroad tests show that it people intuitively understand instinctively understand that they should yield to oncoming traffic again it's only when there's a left turn day because they see green they see the left-turn arrow on the ground they somehow certain small segment of population things they still have the right away and they don't have to yield to oncoming traffic but it's not the case are there any questions or comments for this witness senator DuBose passage seconded by Senator Lynch all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bill passes the next bill we have is bill number 661 by Senator feel AG yes often I thank you as a chairperson for reducing this bill as well this one would change the definition of a divided highway and the purpose of that is to close a loophole in a law that allows exemptions to stopping for school buses in that exemption is motorists undivided highways are not required to stop for a school bus the issue is at the definition of divided highway in the current law states that it's a median strip separating opposing lanes of traffic that in a lot of cases in you know in Providence in other places could be a a striped flush median just some paint on the ground where you know children can cross the intent of that divided highway was meant to be a physically divided highway though with unpaved like a freeway or a limited access highway not a local 25 mile per hour street and the cameras on on these buses its automated violation detections they've been getting throw thrown out on this technicality because it's they've been pointing to in rightfully so it says a divided highway is a meeting strip separating opposing lanes of traffic but but I think the the intent is really just for high-speed freeways and limited access roadways that vehicles do not have to stop for a school bus so you're saying would have to be some structure like a barrier say a barrier in between or correct the bill proposes to have the language say whenever any highway has been divided into two roadways by leaving in unpaved intervening space or by a physical barrier every vehicle shall be driven only upon it and it goes on to say that that's different what struck was the language identifying that and lower meeting strip operating opposing lanes of traffic as a divided highway meeting strip I think is the term that was causing that that confusion a meeting strip in nature in the legislators money committee members have any questions senator Lynch moves passage seconded by Senator Archibald all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bill passes thank you the next bill will do is bill number 490 we do have here to speak Kelly Sheridan good evening and welcome Kelly the thing miss chairman this bill is making a very technical clarification to the existing statute that determines the order of priority of payment by a criminal defendant when both court courts are assessed as well as restitution we are not altering the existing statutory priority that restitution payments should come first we're simply clarifying that that priority is triggered after restitution is ordered and this opponent to request of the course that yes miss human are there any questions or comments senator Lynch moves past it second by Senator de Bourgh all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bill passes Thank You mr. chairman the next bill will do is build number 492 and that was put into the request of Senator picado and we do have a number of people here to speak on behalf of the bill we have Michael Burke of DCYF Tim Duffy of these Rhode Island Association of school committees and Bob Marshall of the Ryland developmentally disabled council mr. Burke good evening and welcome Thank You mr. chairman d/f really on the substance of the bill is that is is not weighing in on whether or not it should occur our concern is that the definition of public agency is not clearly defined we assume that that means the school district but also believe it could be viewed as being us which we want to make sure we will provide some language that it's not intended to interfere with our authority or the family courts authority to make placement of children for child welfare juvenile justice or voluntary behavioral health reasons thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you sure thank you Bob Marshall and behalf of the Robin developmental disabilities council we looked at this bill in feel that it would improve the parents ability to advocate on behalf of their child by allowing them to be able to recover cost which currently in many situations they can't do and therefore can pursue their gently actions on their Charles behalf just the RZA I'm going to ask that you maybe sit down with mr. Burke to address some of his we didn't read it that way we were just buying - we were just looking at the education partners if you can sit down with him maybe work out some language we'll be able to bring the bill back with a sub AG with that senator jabal moves to hold for further study seconded by Senator Lynch all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills held for further study the next bill will do is bill number 763 by Senator Goodwin we have Anthony silver of the DMV here good evening and welcome again cadena mr. chair members currently when a license is suspended or a registration is suspended that person who's under suspension is required to bring the document whether it's the credential the license or the registration place a to place from the vehicle bring them in and turn them in this bill would eliminate that requirement would not require them to bring the plates in upon registration nor would it require them to bring their license in upon suspension there is one there is language in here that would permit a law enforcement officer to seize take whatever have you the plates or the document excuse me the credential from the operator if they were stopped while under suspension and this would do several things it's a first of all it's a very customer friendly Rhode Island resident friendly bill because presently when they turned those documents in particularly the license they then need to go upstairs and get an identification card because you have to have identification to check cashed your check and do other types of transactions and then when the when they come back to get their license with those three months or a year later they then have to go back up and turn in the document and and come downstairs again because you can't have an identification card in a driver's license at the same time so we're recommending this again as just cleaning up our business process at the DMV are there any questions or comments eligible I have another question I I think you do a great job so please don't take all of my question not at all senator I I just we get so many cases as attorney so wondering when a client comes in my office and says that the local officer or the State Police had taken the plates and the documents and let's say for some reason the party could restore that license or registration in a short period of time where would the operator then would they still go back to DMV where the officers turn them in yes or they keep them at the local station actually what happens is they ask they stay at the police department until they either picked up or they brought in to us and how often are they brought in I don't know that answer I believe it's monthly but I'm not sure now is that a practice that is current right now anyhow by a lot of them you know something that is not a practice that is uh and that's okay there's a cross say it is a practice it does happen I guess the question is do the locals want to do this if they're being told now this bill would authorize them to do that do they really want to deal with collecting plates managing plates and then having the drop em off at DMV is there some consensus that this is what they want or is it just make it easier for DMV the only thing I can say to your senator is that again I did the job for 30 years and you've done it well I mean I appreciate I appreciate that well I know that we up until Joseph well when I left the service a few years ago we were still doing it yeah you know you know what's happening here and I'm just getting the view from seeing a lot of bills come from the registry and I don't know if this is a man employee situation not enough people working there but it seems like we're removing or we're trying to take the public as far away as we can from DMV because maybe there are not enough people they have to work and handle these things from what we saw earlier today from police reports I know when a client gets their license suspended the first thing they want to do is go across leave traffic tribunal go to DMV get a stamp and they want the clock to run and they turn that I mean so I just hope we don't have some problems with some of those other issues now where people have to follow a court order the statute says you're not required to turn in your license but then the clock doesn't run that's some of my concern about the application of these type of laws those are great questions senator your concerns certainly I share the same concerns if in fact that was going to happen the way we see it is that this will streamline the process for those people who get suspended we have people who come in who believe this is the done suspension for six months but in fact they weren't because they didn't earn that license in right and those people haven't been driving for six months and then their license then they begin a one-year suspension they really end up with an 18-month suspension I think I and now you'd also like to just address I just address a comment that you also made about there being some DMV bills here quite a few and that might look like we're trying to keep evil away in reality we're looking at every single process that we do every transaction every business process that we have at DMV and the reason why we're doing that is because some of them been around for 40 years there's been changes in laws technology has allowed us to do things that we just haven't been doing over the years as you know DMV is quite a large operation I learned that when I arrived eight months ago and we it's just time to do some cleanup to make that place much more efficient and make it a model for the state oh no I agree I think like for example we're going back to safety responsibilities earlier today and we had some issues for example someone operating a vehicle without insurance though now there's a suspension now under the current law are you also have to post the sr22 form correct now how do we address the posting of an sr-22 when the party is not required to even come in with the actual license or registration so how do we facilitate that if if there's no physical I mean is this going to be where you go see your agent and your agent sends it by way of email and is that going to be acceptable great questions but we haven't gotten to the point of where we've decided that that would be part of the business plan for for insurance rectification and non-compliance they may not be a suspension it may be a fine suspensions create a whole new world for us at DMV and I'm not sure that we're doing a service to the Rhode Island residents who are found to be in non-compliance perhaps a fine would be sufficient as opposed to the suspension which then carries the reinstatement fees etc etc etc so we really haven't gotten to the point where we made those decisions yet because as we said I think if you're going to work in I didn't mean to interrupt if you're going to work in suspensions as opposed to fines but you are going to have suspensions and keep the current laws the way they are then if a party is not required to appear then there's got to be some way that you know let's use our technology and say okay then you go to an aging who's authorized or recognized by DMV and get that documentation directly to gmv and begin the process right Zack Lee I think they ought to consider looking into something like that we will because I don't want to see someone show up at DMV and they thought that they were ready to get their license back and they have to serve another year that's not fair to the motorists senel embody just a quick comment direct I like what I'm hearing tonight I like the idea I see it as streamlining and you know the the state accident report form safety responsibility this bill I see it all I mean let's face it the free take a lawyer hats off a minute the public at large the last place they want to be is at the DMV so the more that we can you know streamline that process I applaud it completely so thank you very much senator senator Chabal Thank You mr. chairman I want to echo senator Lim body so it's where I share the concerns of senators aboard a certain level of advising people both as a defense attorney as to what they're going to do when they turn their license in and their registration and and how you're going to handle these things just on the volume of documents that are submitted I applaud you for wanting the streamlined the Department of Motor Vehicles and I don't think it's to alienate people I had to go over the top of the motor vehicles six months ago and I was amazed at how fast I was actually sitting in a seat tell all your friends it was resolved and I said god bless I mean that sincerely it's a it's a step in the right direction to deregulate and get there why should we take these hard documents when what are we going to do with them so I appreciate anything that makes it would we're doing a lot of things here that we've always done because we've done them and I don't like that answer thank you thank you thank you senator Chabot moves to hold for further study seconded by Senator Lynch all in favor signify by saying aye aye opposed the bills he'll for further study the next bill we have is bill number 766 senator wall asked his bill that was put in at the request of the Department of Public Utility Commission and we have Thomas is it Cogan yes that's correct good evening and welcome thank you very much mr. chairman members in the committee our intent with this proposed legislation would be to bring some uniformity to the penalty provisions as they relate to motor carriers of passengers there are three statutorily distinct areas that we regulate jitneys taxis and there will subcategory of limited public Motor Vehicles and public Motor Vehicles currently the penalty provisions for public motor vehicle and fractions either criminal or regulatory are up to $1,000 per offense and the criminal provision also includes up to one year in prison the penalty provisions as they currently relate to jitneys and taxis to establish back in the 1930s and those fines are $100 per ads for both jitneys and for taxi infractions are what we're proposing to do in the legislation is to utilize that exact same language that appears in the public motor vehicle statute apply that to the area of penalty provisions for jitneys and to apply the penalty provisions as they relate to criminal penalties to taxis so we have uniformity in all three areas senator boyle I just have a question so I'm on this bill the second page the first section of the bill is saying that I guess that you could use the civil penalty in lieu of the criminal sanction is that correct correct okay but this last part of the current law which in subsection B is in addition to and I think we might want to change that too also in lo-ove to make both sections consistent now that was one of the things that we had discussed in in the drafting of this that the intention was some years ago in that is specifically in 39 14 as it relates to the two taxis given the nature of the different businesses and the types of infractions it was the intent some years ago in passing that legislation to give the administrator of the division the latitude that in addition to criminal penalties these regulatory these administrative penalties might be pursued in the case of taxis now I agree with that but I think that you might want to make this consistent and I'll talk to you about it so we can talk to mr. spirito your legal counsel of it okay but in so that I understand senator that that would be to me be in lieu of or or to have it at the administrators discretion in addition to I would think I think you want to in lieu of I think I wanted in lieu of because that's what you are proposing in the first section of this bill is to be in lieu of yet the second one cases I'm just trying to make it I think consistent that's or you're changing for adding something but at the same time the existing law now is inconsistent with what we're doing that's second we can talk Senator Paul will talk to your a legal counsel Afton if we can come up with some agreed-upon language i authorized a sub a with that senator ball moves to hope refer the study seconded by Senator Lynch well a favor signify by saying aye opposed senator jablow moves that we adjourn second by Senator Lynch all in favor opposed"

Reynolds vapor innovative digital tobacco product they advertise on their own website they are a tobacco product reading from their website page the Food and Drug Administration is expected to regulate electronic cigarettes views is a tobacco product under federal law they do not burn tobacco but rather heat liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco I refer back to the definition under federal law a tobacco product means any product made or derived from tobacco nicotine comes from tobacco these are tobacco products and they're illegal to sell to minors in California but they're being marketed to minors in California products with the name gummy bear Mountain Dew cotton candy they are marketing to our children and addicting them to nicotine this is the reason I am here colleagues I'm not here to make any kind of political point or any other kind of point this is a serious health issue California has invested over two billion dollars and twenty five years to lower tobacco usage tobacco products according to the World Health Organization were responsible for the deaths eight over eight percent of all deaths worldwide caused by tobacco products in the past year in the United States alone over four hundred and forty thousand Americans died because of tobacco usage in the past year put that into some context for you four hundred and forty thousand Americans died from tobacco use that's more than from alcohol cocaine heroin homicide suicide fires car accidents and AIDS combined and they are marketing to our children so I know this is a disagreement that I have with the chair on this but I just hope that you will seriously consider the importance of the issue before you today we are in agreement that cigarette cigarettes should fall under the safe smoking rules within California we agree on that we agree that they should comply with the stake Act which is an acronym for stop tobacco access to kids Enforcement Act which allows for sting operations and have cut the illegal sales of traditional cigarettes from 55 percent down to 8 percent so that's all good and well but it's no small difference of opinion whether these are tobacco products or not because if they're not tobacco products big tobacco can continue to market their non tobacco product to our children and why do I say big tobacco because Wells Fargo securities has already stated that beyond the end of the decade big tobacco will own over 75% of the e-cigarette industry capture what's going on here Big Tobacco has long sought a safer delivery system that's their word a safer delivery system for their addictive toxic nicotine I don't know if you were around in the 1970s I was the safer delivery system for their toxic addictive nicotine was filtered cigarettes we all paid the price because decades later it was revealed they knew quite well how dangerous their filtered cigarettes were in the case of Kent micro night filters they were using a bestest so I'm not here to tell you what they know or don't know today but they don't want this to be regulated as a tobacco product for obvious reasons this bill contains no suggestion of a taxation on e-cigarettes that is not a part of this bill but as long as they are deemed non tobacco products Board of Equalization or any other taxing body cannot will not tax them but this bill as it is before you today does not even refer to taxation so that's not the debate today the debate before you is whether you agree with the Food and Drug Administration with the World Health Organization with the Centers for Disease can control the Cancer Society the American Lung Association the American Cancer excuse me the American Heart Association the police chiefs Association their narcotics Association the CMA every Health Organization is here to support this bill as a tobacco product so thank you for the opportunity to have an honest debate here I appreciate that very much but I just want you to look at the facts and look at what's happening and if you care about the health and the future of our children it's a lot about the health of our children that we're here today I hope you'll agree with why we're doing what we're doing so with that I would like to introduce our speakers we have a number of physicians here who will speak to the issue at hand dr. Michael on will lead as associate professor at UCLA dr. Michael Liu sac is with Kaiser Permanente I would like them introduce the City Attorney of Los Angeles our former colleague like Fuehrer's with us and then our fourth and last mr. chair presenter will be John level on behalf of the California narcotic Officers Association and the California police chiefs Association why law enforcement supports this bill as a tobacco product I thank you very much for your attention dr. on Thank You senator Leno so my name is Michael long I'm an associate professor at UCLA and I also am the chair for the state of California tobacco education research every site committee the committee actually has already sent in a letter in support of senator Leno's bill and part of the reason why is because the committee itself supports the treatment of electronic cigarettes as tobacco products and as Senator Leno stated this would be consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration and other key organizations that monitor health and healthcare I think that it is imperative to think about why it is such an urgent issue to focus on electronic cigarettes at this time rather than the furring action so in the state health officers report on electronic cigarettes that was issued earlier this year there are several key findings that I think that are important based on other studies that have been going on in the United States in 2014 teen use of electronic cigarettes surpassed the use of traditional cigarettes for the first time with more than twice as many eighth and tenth graders reporting using electronic cigarettes than traditional cigarettes and among 12th graders 17 percent reported currently using electronic cigarettes versus 14 percent using traditional cigarettes and in California while adults using electronic cigarettes in the past 30 days doubled from 1.8 percent in 2012 to 3.5% in 2013 for young adults aged 18 to 29 years old electronic cigarette use tripled in only one year from 2.3 percent to 7.6% I have to say that for our committee we interact with the Department of Education and we have heard quite consistently that within school districts they are highly concerned about the use of electronic cigarettes among their youth while sales as Senator Leno mentioned are restricted from children they still are able to obtain them and so when we do not have the means to regulate electronic cigarettes as we do with tobacco products it makes it all that much more difficult to prevent these individuals from getting addicted I think that it is also important to remind everyone that nicotine is a highly addicting substance it is known Thaksin it's actually on the proposition 65 list of chemicals that are restricted due to either causing cancer birth defects and other reproductive harm and the main reason why is because nicotine actually affects the cardiovascular system so in terms of its leading cause of death this includes both cancer as well as heart attacks and strokes and so what if we don't act on electronic cigarettes at this point I think that what we would unfortunately be doing is causing suffering among all the future generations of Californians I have to say as a practicing physician when I work with people with tobacco related diseases when they look back on their decades of having smoked they all wish that they didn't do it but unfortunately they you know when you start using an addicting substance that you're not actually informed well about it becomes very difficult to make a choice when you have a lot of peer pressure so I think that in terms of focusing on the health of future Californians I think that it is important for us to focus on electronic cigarettes and to treat them as tobacco products and I agree with what senator Leno has already mentioned already thank a doctor doctor good afternoon my name is Michael Luczak I'm an emergency physician with Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento and Roseville I also hold faculty appointment at the UC Davis Medical School you may be wondering why would an emergency physician come and testify about this bill and I'd like to share with you my experience as a medical student decades ago when I was rotating in a primary care clinic during this rotation my preceptor ruthlessly emphasized smoking cessation and had all kinds of smoking cessation efforts programs and worked very very hard to get his patients enrolled and get them to stop smoking and one one afternoon after clinic I asked him why he emphasized this so much and he explained to me that he felt that when when we do a successful cardiac resuscitation in the emergency department or in other settings the patient is likely to only have a few years because of the burden of their disease but if he could get someone to stop smoking that the intervention that he achieved would buy them years decades more of quality life so the reality is in the emergency department even when we're successful and we can resuscitate someone from a cardiac arrest their their likelihood of leaving the hospital and surviving is less than 10% because that advanced disease is already present as as my colleague pointed out in contrast if we can get patients to stop smoking or prevent them from smoking we're adding decades to their their quality of life your decision here today will save lives many more lives then then my emergency medicine colleagues and I will ever save during resuscitations in the emergency department we know that California is a leader in tobacco cessation and prevention we already have one of the lowest youth smoking rates in the nation promotion and is increasing use of e-cigarettes however and that threatens this success in my opinion these are electronic nicotine delivery devices and they must be regulated east cigarettes are addicting an entire new generation of young people to nicotine we're also seeing accidental poisonings with children with four children with nicotine and it's increasing dramatically over the last few years secondhand aerosol emissions adversely impact public health just the way secondhand smoke does and and and in the reality of our fiscally constrained times fiscal responsibility demands that the taxpayer not bear the burden of the cost resulting from damage to public health from these devices nicotine is a highly addictive drug cigarettes are drug delivery devices East cigarettes do not emit water vapor they emit a mixture of toxic chemicals which are used to suspend the toxic substance toxic and clear Atta genic so birth defect causing substance of nicotine in an aerosol for delivery to the users the e-cigarette aerosol not only contains that teratogenic substance the birth defect causing substance nicotine but numerous other carcinogens and chemicals known to cause birth defects there are no studies demonstrating that e-cigarettes are helpful in helping patients smokers quit studies have indicated 89% of these cigarette users are still using them a year after starting and other studies indicate that e-cigarette users are one-third less likely to quit cigarettes than people who don't use these cigarettes I urge you to help protect users and non-users of e-cigarettes from the health risks associated with these dangerous products the proposed bill Senate bill 140 with the new FDA proposed ruling defining e-cigarettes as tobacco products and in my mind these are clearly tobacco products any standard toxicology reference looking at nicotine as a toxin nicotine is a naturally occurring toxic chemical found in tobacco plants it's not found anywhere else and when you look at the toxicities associated with nicotine they are the same toxicities as we see and are treated like nerve agent this is in fact a hazardous hazardous material and the tox textbooks talk about approaching it as a hazmat incident if there's a spillage the fiscally responsible course is to minimize the burden on California taxpayers that results from the adverse effects of e-cigarettes but more importantly your decision here today will save lives thank you doctor say the attorney thank you very much senator Leno good afternoon committee it's great to see so many former colleagues and friends here it's very weird to be sitting in this chair as I make this presentation so I am the City Attorney of Los Angeles I'm like fewer I have an office of about 900 people in it we have about 10 offices throughout the city we perform a range of tasks we write every law in the city we advise on every legal issue our office defends the city when its we represent the city in affirmative litigation and we prosecute tens of thousands of cases every year I'm here today in my capacity as the office in charge of tobacco enforcement in the city of Los Angeles in that role our office drafts legislation we enforce the law by prosecution other means we train law enforcement we have a contract with the California Department of Health Services to conduct the undercover investigations the stings that are referred to in the steak act we educate businesses and the public I've been in office for two years in those two years we've reduced underage smoking by 25 percent in Los Angeles I'm here today to talk about our experience with this issue Los Angeles for the last year and a half has adopted a rule nearly identical to that which Senator Leno proposes and SB 140 I want to talk about why we did that and what our experience has been with that and the hope that will illuminate these issues for the committee before we adopted the ordinance in our role as the oversees of tobacco issues in Los Angeles we got a number of complaints from different sources we got complaints before regulation from individuals involved education system in my city for example one school principal reported to us the confiscation on one afternoon of 6te cigarettes from his middle school students we saw we heard complaints from parents in particular about e-cigarettes in public locations we heard from workers concerned about the effects of e-cigarettes in the locations where they worked on their free future health and we heard from business owners who weren't clear about what the rules were regarding e-cigarettes and how they could accommodate their patrons who didn't wish to be subjected to secondhand vapor from a cigarette at the same time as we heard those complaints each cigarette outlets were proliferating throughout our city so we made a decision we made the decision that in the absence of any scientific evidence that e-cigarettes are safe and given the concerns that have been expressed by many public health advocates about the normalization of smoking behavior by having e-cigarettes present in public locations we took the precautionary approach and adopted as I mentioned that regulates these cigarettes precisely as we as we regulate other tobacco related products now that experience has yielded variety of results first workers are protected now they're not involuntarily subjected to e cigarette vapor we've decreased the environments in which families are subjected to secondhand vapor from a cigarette our office no longer gets complaints about e-cigarettes maybe one or two as opposed to dozens and dozens our office has worked with businesses they're delighted to now have clear rules about these issues so they can be sure that the patrons on whom they rely continue to return we haven't had any community for compliance issues brought forward to our office in a year and a half and not the slightest effort to roll back our legislation in the city of Los Angeles in other words it's been a resounding success from the standpoint of the business community from parents from schools from everyone in the city so why is state action needed on this issue it shouldn't be that whether you are subjected and whether your kids are subjected to secondhand vapor from the e-cigarettes depends on where you live in the state a child's health is a child's health a pregnant woman's health is a pregnant woman's health someone who is a vulnerable person to these kinds of vapors shouldn't have to determine where to be in our state based on the faculty this patchwork of rules throughout California I want to underscore as in mr. Leno's bill in Los Angeles we're not saying you can't have a cigarette you can use them but you simply use them in the same locations as you're permitted to use tobacco products now I also want to point out by the way that mr. Leno's bill is an important thing it extends the stake act to e-cigarettes why does that matter I can mean a meeting with a range of enforcement agencies state and local enforcement agencies just yesterday on this issue and to a person every enforcement entity in that room said the same thing and that is in the absence of stake act extension to e-cigarettes their work is undermined in their effort to prove kids from getting involved with East cigarettes and smoking generally you've heard the statistics about the tremendous escalation and e-cigarette use among kids but there's no stake act skiing operations pursuant to that right now because the Act doesn't go that far very important to do that I'll conclude with this there are a number of opponents arguments that have been raised one of those arguments is well addressed by our public health experts to my left emissions from e-cigarettes it has argued are just like water vapor and nothing could be further from the truth at least 10 carcinogenic elements in the aerosol that is emitted from a cigarettes there's not a single independent peer-reviewed study that says anything other than that opponents gonna argue that e-cigarette restrictions are going to discourage people from engaging in this ostensible tobacco cessation activity but again let's be real listen to our own state experts of the Department of Public Health for example who say there is no evidence that links tobacco cessation with ecig arete use let me talk about something else I want to address the issue as I wind up here of the definition of what an e-cigarette is precisely the changes that change the amendment that is proposed today was proposed in our city it was proposed by the e-cigarette industry and we rejected it and I'll tell you why we rejected it in part because of the reasons that Senator Leno indicated we rejected it because the fed the FDA is on the verge of adopting a rule that is precisely the opposite of that our National Health Affairs just the opposite and we knew that was coming even a year and a half ago that was on its way we does it because of potential confusion by the way so is this an e-cigarette or is this a traditional cigarette I bet you no one from your vantage point could tell what the answer to that question is same is true of enforcement entities in your jurisdictions the people who brought you up here are going to confront the same challenges in enforcement this looks like any cigarette this looks like a cigarette we're very few moments in the role of a state legislator where one has the opportunity to take a meaningful tangible step to protect public health to advance the cause of businesses who need certainty on this issue throughout our state to establish a set of meaningful reasonable consistent rules and act consistently with the federal government all at the same time this is one of those moments that's why I flew up here that's why I endured a canceled flight and raced to another airline just to get up here because the experience in Los Angeles has been so successful on this issue I can only hope that others in the state can benefit from the same approach mr. chair members thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today mr. chair members of the committee my name is John Lovell and I'm here on behalf of the California police chiefs Association the California narcotic Officers Association and the California college and university police chiefs Association one of the alarming trends with a cigarette has been their exponential increase among children and let's be real this is not a product that is delivering anything healthy to children the you can buy cartridges on the internet that contain a hundred milligrams of nicotine now to put that into context an individual cigarette is what ten 15 milligrams of nicotine so this is this is tobacco products on steroids the other disturbing trend that we have seen is that e-cigarettes are being used as a delivery system for illegal drugs you are seeing cigarettes used and if you go on the internet you'll see people even bragging about it used as a delivery system for butane hash oil which is a 90 percent THC product now people will tell you well it's illegal to sell e-cigarettes to children and that's true but there isn't an effective enforcement mechanism under current law to actualize that prohibition one of the things that is critical about this bill is that it brings a cigarette where they are where they ought to be under the rubric of the steak Act which enables us to use all of the various strategies that we've used to successfully reduce tobacco use before the steak Act tobacco use among children I mean the rate of illegal sales was up at the 50 percent mark it's now down to about five percent we need to have that same strategy for yet another tobacco product and that's why the groups I recommend that I represent strongly support this legislation okay thank you all for your testimony and support at this time we'll take any testimony in opposition to the measure one else in support well do we have other supporters that want to add on you can use the microphone at the front of the room name and organization please keep it short are we testifying if we're talking at length or we testifying from here or the chair I think just

for your testimony well conservative text it's alright good afternoon mr. chairman and honorable committee members my name is Eric Beale and for 17 years I was a pack and a half a day tobacco smoker until I switched to a safer alternative vapor product no longer am I inhaling harmful tobacco smoke all day long or subjecting my loved ones and the public around me to deadly secondhand tobacco smoke I am here today as the volunteer legislative advisor for the California Chapter of Sephora the smoke free alternatives trade association as you may be aware there are approximately fourteen hundred retailers and also hundreds of manufacturers distributors and others who make up the California vapor product market not to mention the vapor product consumers who have finally found an alternative to combustible tobacco use first off I would like to be clear that spoda is willing to engage in discussions on the following topics strengthening prohibitions on selling to minors ensuring safe and child-resistant packaging consistent with federal standards and developing licensure requirements that are reasonable appropriate to our products and not overly burdensome but SB 140 s inclusion of vapor products in California's existing definition of tobacco is directly counterproductive to fair and reasonable progress in crafting public policy to address innovative products such as e-cigarette and vapor products in fact we know that the existing statutory definition of electronic cigarettes and vapor products could productively be used to advance such goals there is no need to define vapor products as tobacco under state law we are supportive of the committee's proposed amendments to delete the language defining the industry and these products as tobacco as that is our fundamental concern if the bill moves forward we would like to work on the remaining issues related to age verification for online purchases the birth of our industry was driven by the desire to develop radically different and substantially less harmful to combustible tobacco it is important to our membership and our customers that an appropriate distinction be maintained additionally from a sheer common sense and scientific perspective there is little doubt that there are key differences between products currently defined as tobacco products or vapor products and to address the testimony the gentleman before me asking whether you could differentiate a tobacco product or a vapor product and he held up something that looked like a cigarette and then a cig like this is a vapor product okay it's quite different than a combustible tobacco cigarette vapor products were invented to be marketed towards smokers wanting to become non-smokers the smoke free tobacco free and often nicotine free products are not tobacco products and classifying them as such does send a confusing and inaccurate message to smokers still battling tobacco vapor products are one of the most revolutionary products we have ever seen and they provide immense opportunity for harm reduction and our opposition letter references several studies on this point in conclusion on behalf of sue Fattah we ask you to focus on public policy solutions that are thoughtfully calibrated to address this class of products and to oppose SB 140 s flawed approach thank you good afternoon chairman gray vice-chair Linder and distinguished members of the committee my name is gregory connelly i am here today on behalf of a nonprofit organization called the american vaping association which advocates for small and medium sized businesses and the vapor product and electronic cigarette markets next month on august 10th I will be celebrating five years as an ex-smoker for on nine years I was a very dedicated smoker and the patch gum laws and all failed me like they fail about 93 to 97 percent of people that use them each year once I quit I became very interested in this subject and spent three years as a volunteer consumer or rather volunteer legislative director for the US as largest consumer group representing around 60,000 consumers of vapor products almost all of whom are ex smokers I am here today to strongly urge you to reject SB 140 as passed by the Senate because its enactment threatens over 1,400 small businesses in California that are employing California citizens occupying what may otherwise be empty storefronts paying sales and unemployment taxes and most importantly providing effective smoke-free alternatives to California's 3.6 million adult smokers this state has made great progress in reducing smoking but again 3.6 million adult smokers remain let's be clear as my colleague stated this industry does not oppose and does not oppose additional regulations designed to strengthen California's existing sales ban to minors there are great options available including applying the the portions of the stake act that allow for sting operations to these products without defining us as tobacco it boggles the mind to think that just because something is defined as tobacco that that will somehow reduce usage if when it's not defined as tobacco you are still doing Axew at youth access enforcement sting operations etc and we strongly encourage that to become law however we oppose trying to fit a square peg into a round hole which is exactly what this bill would do by defining these products as tobacco there were four points I will just respond to a couple very quickly in the federal case trying to prevent successfully the FDA from banning e-cigarettes four or five years ago and joy never said we are a tobacco product and joy said there is an option out there a potential option and in dicta in the district court's decision in DC judge Leon did note that that is a possibility for the future Altria and Reynolds they are tobacco companies you're all familiar with them yes they make e-cigarettes but they do not represent this industry this industry was created by ex smokers who use these products to quit we do not really respect them and we do not take their labels as somehow applicable to our products and lastly this bill would make nicotine-free eliquid x' devices that are sold without nicotine they would make all of these tobacco products the federal FDA regulation would not unless a product contains nicotine or it is sold alongside nicotine it will not be a tobacco product but in this bill it would be so in California and before and just to wrap it up I urge you this some of the committee amendments are certainly better than what we have in SB 40 is proposed however I urge you to look at two issues very closely one if we do not make these tobacco products the exemption for smoking in a retail tobacco store no longer applies so a Amendment saying that vaping in vapor stores is permitted just as smoking is permitted in retail tobacco stores those that would be greatly appreciated also age verification for online sales if you require a six dollar thing for every single order where the postman has to check the ID of the person ordering what you're going to have is thousands of California consumers ordering from companies in Virginia in New Jersey in North Carolina and the California AG or the California the Department of Health will be at a loss for enforcing that meanwhile California companies will comply and they will suffer their revenue will go down there this is a 21st century there are better methods for age verification than for every single order requiring the person to be at home when the order comes to sign and show their ID vapor products are changing lives every day in Californian across the nation we know from studies state funded studies Minnesota and Oklahoma the most the most used quit smoking product in that state and I would bet my entire savings account that the same is true in California today so please do not over regulate this growing industry that is helping Californians every day thank you and I would be thrilled to answer any questions that you have okay there are any other any other testimony in opposition at this time seeing none I'll bring it back to the do we have some meters [Music]

strongly oppose this bill okay seeing no more opposition let me begin the discussion senator by commending you for your work in this area I know a number of legislators have brought similar measures some of the provisions were discussing today before this body in the past few years it's clearly an important public policy discussion and there's broad support and opposition on your particular measure in your opening comments you focused on what I think's the more important point which is that there's broad agreement certainly between myself and and the proposed committee amendments and and much of what you're trying to do there is a point of contention over the definition and let me just for the consideration of the members in the discussion quickly review the proposed committee amendments the first one is the area of disagreement striking the definition of tobacco product using the Health and Safety Code definition in its place which still allows us to deal with the licensure and smoke-free laws the consumer protections and public health issues this second amendment requiring age verification upon mail delivery of e-cigarettes the third prohibiting East cigarettes from being sold offered for sale or distributed from a vending machine and the fourth requiring child-resistant packaging of e-cigarettes this is a provision currently an SB 438 by Senator Hale I think it's a good provision I think the addition of those provisions strengthen the bill and with the adoption of all of the committee amendments you'll certainly have my support here today and I would hope broader support here in the committee with that I'm going to open it up for discussion I see mr. pariah will recognize you first Thank You mr. chair like the chair to the author I just want to commend you on on the work that you're doing on this bill I think I mean you're no stranger to difficult issues and this is certainly one of those and so I want to thank you for the work that you're that you're doing on this and I apologize I missed most of the testimony I think I came in towards the end of the video sent your office I think I came in towards the end of yours which you said something that I wanted to ask you if you could expand a little bit more because I think it goes to this idea this question of the definitions that really seems to be the bone of contention here's you know this you know should this should these products be defined as the same way as as tobacco products you had a device that you used that said that they had doesn't have nicotine in it can you I'm not I don't understand the vaping world so I don't know what what what this is all about but can you just talk a little bit about a little bit more about the different types of devices types that don't have nicotine some that do I mean can you just explain to me a little more this industry when it was built there were some that wanted to use e-cigarettes to not only get off cigarettes but also get themselves off of nicotine and so from 2009 onwards air have been nicotine free products and so you have as the alt Riyaz and Reynolds of the world they only sell nicotine containing products their products look like cigarettes they contain cartridges and they are by the different color from cigarettes they are shaped just like them now the vapor product industry all the people behind us all use products like this you buy e liquid this one does have a child-resistant cap that would comply with the amendment and you buy tanks or other things that you put the liquid in and you buy the device separately and from the looks of it FDA regulation of vapor products will only be covering products that are sold as containing nicotine or a component of a product that is sold with nicotine and so there are a lot of unanswered questions about what exactly will be a tobacco under federal law but it appears plainly clear to me as an attorney who studied the Tobacco Control Act for many years that the devices themselves if they do not contain nicotine as well as nicotine free eliquids will not be tobacco products but under SB 140 as passed by the Senate they would be do we know when the FDA will be coming out with their the rules they are now saying end of summer early fall it had been June but there are a lot of issues there's a Congress is actually dealing with some of it right now there's a lot of concern that the FDA regulation if it has not changed could end up pretty much putting every small business in this room out of business so there's a lot of FDA is really concentrating really looking at the evidence so but under the current bill is proposed products and maybe this is a question the author products with or without nicotine would be classified as tobacco thank you for letting me respond to some blamin so first of all there are claims that there are east cigarettes without nicotine but this is an unregulated industry so claims may not be true and in fact there are peer-reviewed respected studies led by Stanley Glantz professor at University of California San Francisco which have documented that products that claim to have no nicotine in fact contain nicotine so that's point one point two if they are cessation devices and I want to say Bravo sincerely to all these folks who came today to say that they have not used cigarettes since they've used e-cigarettes and that they're clearly cessation devices well the end joy lawsuit notwithstanding where they argue that they were tobacco products and won that case that not withstanding if they are cessation devices it's as simple as the industry making application to the Food and Drug Administration to become a cessation device but they haven't done that and there not proposing to do that and if they do and I encourage them to do so if they are sincere clearly these would be the ones without nicotine make your case go to the FDA and if you become a cessation device this bill as written will not impact you because this only deals with tobacco products not cessation devices but there's a way to become a cessation device and this industry has not pursued that path well thank you for that response I appreciate that I mean I've really I've really struggled with this bill and it's mostly around the definition I think you know colleagues I think it would be a mistake not to do something in this arena I think we've seen this bill so many times and different versions I think we should begin to address the issue I just wonder if you know based on the author's comments based on the comments from the opposition and what the FDA may or may not do I just wonder if if if leaving the definition piece out is okay for now to allow some of these other things to occur I mean if in fact there is no regulation or no standard that proves some products have nicotine or some don't you know maybe you ought to be talking a little bit about that I mean I mean I don't know I just sort of throw that out as an idea not necessarily to apply in this bill but just sort of something to think about and so I mean look I I know that you know as authors our bills always get amended and certainly I think every single one it might has been amended in the last two weeks taking out very critical pieces that I thought were important two things I was trying to advocate for but having said that I do think it would be a mistake not to do something in this arena and not to move a bill forward and so you know listening to the chairs of men's I think those are I think they're I think it's more than than a halfway point I think I think in your particular measure you achieve what a lot of other people have not been able to achieve I know it's not everything but it to me it would seem like a lot so I would be supportive of moving the bill as amended in fact I would make a motion to that effect okay we have a motion to the author to decide if that's something the other wants to accept but I'm certainly willing to put a motion on the table to move this bill forward as amended by the chair because I do think it makes a lot of important changes it doesn't get at that sort of the heart and the big piece of the definition but I'm not sure I'm there yet on the definition I'm not saying that I wouldn't be there down the road I just think that there are still a few innings that still need to be played before we make a hard decision on that particular piece so that would be my motion Thank You mr. chairman I respond to the Assemblyman just one second senator we have a motion we have a second by mr. Gibson we have a third by mr. Bigelow without objection members we can just adopt the amends but to return to the Senators point that would return us to the main question of the bill senator and to mr. parez point would you want to proceed further I would like to first of all could we have a roll call vote on the amendments I'm requesting a roll call vote on the amendments it's not required without objection there would be no roll call I'd like to ask the question of the author but we assign members Levine asking for a roll call vote on that we can go ahead and move well I'd also like to question the author about the amendments okay but on the point of the roll call did you want to are you silent on that then I'd like to ask a question so I would object to amending them before questions mr. Cooley has substituted for you and favors roll call so senator we will do a roll call vote thank you before you take this roll call because it is a very important point it's the whole reason we're here and that's why I wanted to respond if briefly before you roll call to Assemblyman Perea well certainly the motion would be debatable so we'll afford you thank you a moment to response I appreciate that so and thank you for your graciousness I'm afraid I think of you as one of the most rational members among the legislature I say that sincerely and complimentary you're thoughtful and you're rational and I want to have a rational conversation here you were not in the room so I'll show this to the committee a second time this is the website of the vapor they call themselves an innovative digital tobacco product the industry now mr. Connolly I have your name right yes okay mr. Connolly may argue back and he's an attorney I'm not so I should be very careful here that this is r.j. Reynolds and they've got a different agenda from the non Big Tobacco I'll get to that in a second but RJ Reynolds says we are a tobacco product they go on to say about their product they do not burn tobacco but rather heat liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco as you heard the doctor say you didn't hear the doctor spoke there's only one place from which nicotine comes it's tobacco federal definition of a tobacco product is any product that comes or derived from tobacco you don't have nicotine without tobacco it's derived from by federal definition it's a tobacco product so for those cigarette products that have tobacco have nicotine I don't know how a rational person can conclude it's not a tobacco product it is also by federal definition also by determination of the FDA and penny regulations now for those that may or may not have and we don't know because they're unregulated they claim they are they don't don't have to prove it to anybody but if there are in fact products for e-cigarettes that do not contain nicotine as I said earlier they have every opportunity to go to the FDA and say we're not nicotine test our products we're a cessation device we get people off of cigarettes they can do that they have not so the bill without that first amendment that you're about to all vote on makes complete sense it is counter-intuitive to vote aye on this first amendment to take out the words tobacco product and again there is reason why there are those who would like to take the words tobacco product out because then r.j. Reynolds and here's a story from Philip Morris to debut a cigarette with real tobacco they're taken the next step and they're also studies that have shown that as the industry continues to grow the content of the nicotine increases because it's addictive they've got you they'll get you more now again if you got a product without go to the FDA prove you don't have nicotine and become a cessation device and then I just want to read last last advertisement here this is from mark 10 again their website advertisement voluntarily mark 10 puts on its advertisement warning this product is not intended for use by women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or persons with or at risk of heart disease high blood pressure diabetes or taking medicine for depression or asthma nicotine is addictive and habit-forming and it is very toxic by inhalation they put this on their product voluntarily because they know the risks of it they know it is nicotine and they know it comes from tobacco so I would urge you to support the second and third and fourth amendments I appreciate the chair make good sense but to move forward with this is not a tobacco product is a very dangerous thing to do and should a majority of those voting today support all four amendments not only do I walk away from the bill the American Cancer Society walks away from the bill the American Heart Association walks away from the bill the lung association walks away from the bill the CMA it's away from the bill the narcotics Officers Association walks a bit and the police chief's all walk away we all walk away it is no longer our bill it cannot move forward with any of our blessings because it is a dangerous thing to do because all these folks say they've left cigarettes that's a good thing now I also have to say that no jobs will be lost the only difference between if if our bill is going to kill jobs and all those small vape shops through hey the chair wants to amend the bill and you're about to vote to do will do the same thing the only difference is whether it's a dip a co-product bless everyone's heart here who has left cigarettes that's a good thing for everybody I'm here today and all of our sponsors are here today to protect the children and if it's not defined as a tobacco product they'll still market to our children they'll still hook our children and that's why it's such an important difference so I thank you for your time I know you're gonna take your vote well I urge a no vote senator thank you for your comments that's the first invitation I've had in my short career to join you on the job killer list but I will certainly parts it just isn't true it isn't from any further debate on the motion I see I know mr. prey wanted to follow up and then mr. Cooley mr. Garcia mr. Linder so all right some discuss who's in my first prayer you're recognized thank you I'll be very brief because I know a lot of other members want to speak and I don't want to turn this you know into a debate other than to say that what concerns me and where I really struggle with the definition pieces to the gentleman here that testified that his product which doesn't contain nicotine would be caught up in the construct and framework of SB 140 and your response to that as well but there's an out they can go to the FDA they can get file this petition and I'm not familiar with this process but they can go do this I worry that and we put these folks who don't have nicotine in their product in a and it sounds like most of them are pretty small businesses small shops throughout the state I think I heard a couple people testify from Fresno I worried that if there's the shop owner it's him and two people three people four people you know do they have the resources do they have the time to not only go through the process of FDA but actually wait for the FDA and and I don't know how long it takes for the FDA to get back to them but if if the federal government is anything like the state government it takes a long time before these bureaucracies provide approvals for these types of products so I just worry that if we do the definition now that we have a whole group of individuals who will get caught up in this sort of political bureaucratic thing when they don't have to be so that's why I think that again it would be a mistake not to do something on this measure that's why I think the rest of the bill makes a lot of sense because we're moving the ball forward and still give us some time to figure out whether or not the definition how we play out that definition piece and I'm not saying I would be opposed to the definition maybe a year from now or well really just a year from now cuz I'm gone at the end of next year would be my last shot to weigh in but just having said that I just think we need more information because I just don't want I don't want there to be collateral damage for some folks similar in its definition P's all in my my piece just let me point out it's one under point out real briefly that none of these shops will be impacted with amendment one or without amendment one they won't be impacted at all they don't have to go to the FDA to become a cessation device this bill will not ban anything that they're doing and proof of it is at least a number of them said they were from San Jose from San Francisco San Diego guess what those cities already have that's which this bill proposes without the first amendment has law currently and they're in business and they're doing fine and they don't want us to do anything we're not doing anything proposing anything that is going to impact them they're already living with the local ordinance that does what I'm suggesting we do so that's a false argument I'm sorry to and no one has to go to the FDA to apply I'm just saying that if you innovative entrepreneur do have a non nicotine a cigarette product and some claim they have no one's stopping them from getting definitely getting the recognition as a cessation device I hope that helps okay members you know the motion we've allowed senator Leno to respond but the motions before us with a second that we've asked for roll call votes so I'm going to go ahead and ask the secretary call the roll but let me remind everybody what we're voting for here mister prey has moved to adopt the committee amendments in their entirety that's all four amendments as but before you have a support position from the chair of support position from the vice chair and members will return to the debate on the bill post this roll call so secretary that motion would be out of order no it would take precedent actually to to amend the amendments to offer a different amendment takes precedent over the one before the body so you're a men you're offering a substitute motion to amend the motion to amend to adopt the committee amendments okay well let's go ahead and call the roll on the substitute motion the chair has a opposed position and the vice chair has an opposed position secretary please call the roll so members before us we have a substitute motion offered by mr. Cooley to amend the original motion which was to adopt all of the committee amendments mr. Cooley has proposed a substitute motion to adopt amendments 2 3 & 4 the point of Lemay's one point of order the the author has already accepted two three and four so I'm not sure the subsidy motion would be an order but the body hasn't acted on it so that's why there is an amendment and it's an appropriate one [Music] mr. Mays we're going to we're going to inquire as to your point of order sir no I said I would take them in South America well the body hasn't voted on it so it's conjecture until then that's why it's an appropriate motion [Music] okay members we have some clarity senator on the motions before us the vote will be on the substitute motion offered by mr. Cooley whether to accept it or to not accept the substitute motion which is amendments two three and four not all of the amendments as proposed by the committee so again the vote members is to accept the substitute motion two three and four offered by some member Cooley the chair has an opposed position the vice-chair point of clarification if we if we approve mr. Cooley's motion then we go after that to the original motion which would include the first amendment as well no if we approve mr. Cooley's motion that would be the motion then the recommend a seat mr. Cooley's motion we return to the original motion by mr. prale okay thank you for the clarification in in that case then my recommendation would be a opposed okay members you have a secretary please call the roll no gray no Linder no Linder no Achadjian Alejo are they holding not voting Bigelow Bigelow no Campos Puli Cooley aye Cooper Cooper aye daily daily no Cristina Garcia Eduardo Garcia Gibson Gibson no Hernandez jones-sawyer jones-sawyer no Levine aye Levine aye mace mace no Correa Perea no Salas Stein north steinorth no Waldron Waldron no Wilk okay members the motion fails and we return to the original D original motion by mr. pariah secretary please call the roll the chair has a high recommendation vice chair is also I recommendation this this is motion to adopt the committee amendments in the entirety one two three and four as noted in the analysis secretary great all right great I Linder aye Linder aye Achadjian Achadjian aye Alejo Alejo not voting Bigelow Campos Bigelow aye Campos not voting no Cooper go Cooper no Daly Daly aye Christina Garcia Eduardo Garcia Gibson Gibson I Hernandez Joan Sawyer Joan Sawyer aye Levine no Levine no mace mace I Priya Priya Salas Stein North Stein north i Waldron Waldron aye Wolk Wolk aye okay the motion passes the committee amendments in their entirety are adopted we return to the main question for us which is senator Leno's bill said sooner how would you like to proceed I first of all want to thank everyone for your attention if not for your vote and to express appreciation for the time you've devoted to this important subject but on behalf of the next generation of Californians who will become addicted to nicotine as a result of your vote igniting also the bill as it stands now was defeated on the Senate floor it's dead on arrival in the Senate I no longer believe in it none of my sponsors believe in it the long list of folks I shared with you before you took your vote no longer believe in it and so I urge your no vote but I cannot support it any longer I just associate myself from it it's a very dangerous bill now children's health will be at risk okay senator do you want to proceed I take it from your comments no my bill anymore hold the bill from the discussion the committee has done that already okay the committee will hold the bill members and Thank You senator for a year well actually if you're asking my I take just for sense of completion I would request a vote on the bill as amended okay do we have a motion or a second just as vice chairs recommendation the caucus will remaining none because there's a fee involved and there are some other provisions in there that that that may be of concern but I will be supporting this bill for now mr. Cooley I'll just take the opportunity to speak on this bill briefly I will not support the bill in this form I think we as members you know our challenge is to tackle the big issues of our day one of the biggest issues of our day is the rising cost of healthcare it touches us in our we've added medical persons into healthcare we've got the Affordable Care Act if we believe in pension systems we have other post retirement benefits there are all there was a wide array of channels to which the cost of health care runs through our governmental system and jeopardizes all manner of programs and our taxpayers we had a ballot proposition last November Proposition 45 that was grappling with the rise in the cost of health care that was patterned on a measure in 1988 which imposed a system of rate regulation that's what prop 45 was based upon and the only way we dealt with that passage here in California when prop 103 passed in 1988 was by the legislature and other policymakers in a wide array of discreet areas tackling cost drivers that ran through the insurance system and three years into this process I definitely try to come to each hearing with an open mind but I believe the purpose of having an opening mind is to close on something solid there are two bills in our agenda today which to me address cost drivers in the system this one and and the one that mister senator Hernandez will bring to us very shortly I think ultimately to deal with cost in the healthcare system this body our colleague body is going to have to look at where are the cost drivers and how do we start to chase them down and I know from the 1980s that when the legislature acted and started cutting down discrete sources of costs it is now possible to look back and see how lines came down cost came down and I think whether we're on it today this issue is going to come back to us we are going to have to grapple with this it's one of the great public policy challenges of our time and so I just appreciate the senator bringing the bill here haven't encouraged your convictions and I think this is a part of a larger conversation on health care costs and a very important one there is no silver bullet dealing with health care costs just as there is no silver bullet dealing with the cost of insurance in the 1980s but a series of farsighted discrete changes the law that star training in the dynamics of the cost system transformed our marketplace in the insurance sector and I think we are gonna have to go down that same trail again so I've just that's sort of behind my approach to this issue today and I would have to say it it's a product of long reflection mr. Levine yeah Thank You mr. chair Thank You senator thank you for everyone who participated in today's debate and came and took time out of your lives to participate in this I I was really glad to hear your explanation as to why the amendments were not satisfactory to you I think that it was a great service to all of us to hear directly from you how you felt about them why they were poisonous to what you were attempting with this legislation it was informative educational and really when we're talking about these public policy issues that have an impact on public health as nicotine products have had for far too long on California in a very detrimental way and that's an understatement that we need to fully air all of those issues and so I just again want to say thank you I'm grateful for it it's challenging to me to walk away from getting something done instead of everything that we wanted to do today but but we need to keep on working on this and and so thank you again for your leadership yeah Thank You mr. Levine for your comments although next time we need to have a tie on to make those comments in committee mr. Garcia Thank You mr. chair senator thank you for bringing the bill forward I came in looking at this issue from a public health standpoint and inclined to support the bill as it stood from listening to the conversation here and the practical approach of Assemblymember Patel looking at it from the standpoint of the four amendments I think three of the amendments are good amendments it reaches to the goals that you've put forward and making sure that we can create as many barriers as possible for children to access these devices so I would say that three of the four amendments I am satisfied that have been adopted and will be moving forward with this piece of legislation whoever decides to carry this forward but I do believe that there needs to be a bigger discussion and a conversation on amendment one as it relates to the definition much of what I've read regarding this industry these products more times than not what we have found is that many of these products do have nicotine much of what I have read also indicates that the FDA is moving in the direction of defining this product as a tobacco product there is federal legislation moving forward to try to grandfather these products prior to that regulation recommendations made by the FDA which tells me that there is a general sense that it is a tobacco product now what we heard today was that there are some products that do not have nicotine I think that makes a bigger conversation in terms of how we classify these products and devices to mr. Assemblymember peres point to blanket every single product as a tobacco product maybe challenged but I'd like to have that conversation I'd like to have that debate and I would hope that other members of this committee would as well because ultimately what we're trying to accomplish is a healthier California and the laws that have been instituted by the state to do so have proven to do exactly that as it relates to the tobacco laws that we have in place so I just wanted to make those statements I have a hard time putting my hands around the fact that we are not going to have the specific conversation about whether or not these products are a tobacco product or not and you know I don't know if there were any doctors here that testified I got here late to that point but it may be something that we want to look at moving forward so again thank you for bringing this bill forward thank you sir mr. Cooper I do want to thank the senator for bringing this bill forward I hadn't planned on speaking but mr. Cooley inspired me and it is really in my community and african-american community Hispanic community smoking and tobacco use is a big issue that the cancer rates the health care issues and you know we surpassed a toothless bill I mean I'm here I came here to to be a voice of people and I'm a I'll agree all the time with everybody but really it has no substance in the bill that was just passed and what my issue is nicotine is addictive with that so we all know that yes not if say it's not tobacco it's still nicotine and I'll tell you what you look around America and we have so many addictions we're an addictive society and having worked 10 years narcotics I'm not comparing this to drugs but people do have addictions and it's nicotine the bottom line they're still inhaling it and I say if you want a cessation I mean I really don't have a lot of faith in that to be honest that's just something that sounds good hey there's no nicotine in it and it appeals to kids I'm not gonna streets a lot I see a lot of kids using these there's an issue with it and for me to sit on my hands would be responsible and I really can't do that and I'm disappointed right now very disappointed and you know people can turn out and see all they want want and you guys are all adults you can make your decisions but kids don't have that decisions and they don't have the brains or intelligence to figure that out but it's something cool to using something cool to do now that's really what matters so that for you your business owners that's that's fine and adults but it comes down to our kids and we've seen a marked increase in kids using vape pants they do it in classrooms because there's no smell you can't see it teachers have their backs turned and they're doing that it's going on right now go talk to folks in the classroom they'll tell you this there's a big issue with that and it is nicotine is tip addictive it is a tobacco product it may not be tobacco that's the derivative so I mean some of these things I'm sitting up here and it's to me it's just disingenuous some of things that were said so like I said I hadn't plan on I'm talking but I can't see how I feel right now but it is it's really just it's just toothless up here past this and it's about our kids that's what it drills down to did a great job passing the smoking laws and getting it down and kids getting away from that this is just another tool so think about our kids but I'm just disappointed today mr. Hernandez Thank You mr. chair I just wanted to commend the author for bringing this bill forward I know that your intentions are altruistic I've had a chance to sit with both your team and with the opposition I believe that you've made the the best arguments with regards to the science and I know that you're trying to be helpful I I've been running the labor and employment committee now and understand that there's been some changes and amendments here that have completely altered the direction that you intend to go towards I'm not comfortable with those amendments and I'm going to be voting no for your request and so I just want to let you know that I don't agree with the way you were treated here today and I you have my support when this bill comes back thank you thank you mr. Shah Gina Jarren Thank You senator I just hate to see that this comes to an end to it is three out of four is not bad even though number one doesn't meet the satisfaction it's just to satisfy your efforts but instead of just putting an end to it and since we're gonna hear something from FDA it wouldn't be worked for you to bring it down the recursion tree concentration just as soon as FDA is as they're ruling on this I'm happy to take reconsideration from the committee should the bill well no my bill has already gone and dead so there's nothing to ask for consideration you're going to pass the bill as it is now and I oppose it as do all of my sponsors all the Health Organization I hear you but all the law enforcement organizations a function wouldn't you think it's at least it's a good step forward with three out of four no it's a dangerous step forward which is why not I just I but everybody else who supports the bill now opposes it any further debate or discussion on the issue seeing none do we have a motion or a second okay seeing none senator we'll hold that bill in committee all right thank you very much nice to meet you not on TV this time okay members let's please keep decorum in the committee room please exit quietly members were going to move to item six senator Wolk please approach and present Thank You mr. chair and members for 62 ads the Green Music Center on the Sonoma State campus to the list of facilities in existing law that are allowed to sell advertising space allows them to accept donated beer and wine and recognize those entities that make donations provided that a temporary license has been issued by ABC for 62 will enable the green music center to increase sponsorships increase fundraising to critical components of a successful performing arts venue the bill has received bipartisan support no opposition and I have some witnesses Andrew Martinez and Tim Lynch just testify in support of the bill and answer any questions I ask for your aye vote move the bill we have a motion in a second Angie Martinez California State University in support of the bill thank you Tim Lynch here not on behalf of any client but on a personal interest in the green music center and we support the bill as well wonderful any opposition seeing none do we have a motion in a second motion mr.

Latura this is Chad well raffles I would like to move SB 549 since i'm d rose why mr. jones-sawyer like to be a joint author Thank You mr. chair members sb 549 would allow professional sports franchises to operate gamed a 50/50 charitable raffles to benefit local charity in California 50/50 charitable raffles or raffles and with 50% of the proceeds go towards the winter prize winner and 50% go to the local charities designated by the team results of 5050 charitable raffles and over 29 states have been tremendous unfortunately current law in California limits the size of the prize only 10% of the raffle and has hindered participation in Cheryl's very shortly briefly SB 549 provides an opportunity for fans who attend professional sporting events to voluntarily participate in a raffle directly benefiting charities and our local communities sb 549 does not challenge change the underlying protections in the law furthermore the bill requires a charitable organization that conducts 50/50 raffle raffles to register report and be regulated by the California Department of Justice this measure will sup will supplement great charitable work done by professional sports franchises throughout the state and allow more charities to benefit from the generosity of sports fair this measure supported by a range of nonprofit organizations including the United Way the American legions and American vets and the Veterans of Foreign Wars I respect to the ass rival okay a new support Andrew Governor on behalf of Californians five major league baseball teams and their minor league affiliates located throughout the state as the chairman Hall said senator Hall in this committee I guess I'm not sure how to do that it has been wildly successful in 29 other states to help bring significantly more money to charities and we believe than anything we can do to encourage private citizens to give more to philanthropic causes as a wonderful thing last year I've a okay any additional support testimony yes chairman and members my name is Erin Johansen I'm the development director of a local charity called TLC s we provide mental health and supportive housing services here in Sacramento County we were one of the 500 charities supported by the Kings last year and we just encourage you to support this bill because the the audience that they have to encourage support by individuals is so much greater than any of us could access on our own that this would be a really wonderful opportunity for charities local charities to benefit from the the exposure that we would get in addition to the funds that are provided by this and we just ask you to vote for this bill thank you okay any additional support testimony yes thank you members my name is Jeff Parmalee and I'm the outreach manager for Sacramento covered Sacramento covered as a nonprofit organization for the past 16 years been serving families and children to connect them with critical health and nutrition resources like medical WIC and Cal fresh in total we provided more than 50,000 children as well as many adults with health coverage services the Sacramento Kings Community Foundation has been a longtime supporter of our organization and has graciously included Sacramento covered as one of their nonprofit beneficiaries in past fundraising efforts 5050 charitable raffles which are operating successfully in theory in nearly every other state with major league sports teams offer a significant increase in donations for local nonprofit programs like ours for each and every dollar counts and directly impacts so many different kinds of underserved populations in our community I hope that you will consider the positive compound effects that this measure will have on many community groups and nonprofit organizations all across the state and most importantly the combined millions of underserved Californians who rely every day on the services we California nonprofits provide they are the ultimate beneficiaries of Senate bill five for nine Thank You mr. chairman members Pete Conaty representing the veterans groups listed in your analysis and we're in very strong support of this bill California's lost over 600,000 veterans past in the last 15 years all the major veterans organizations are struggling to help provide services to our over 500,000 returning veterans since 9/11 so we strongly and some of them are here to testify thank you my name's Benjamin Gumpert I'm the chief marketing officer for the Sacramento Kings I'm representing the Sacramento Kings and the Sacramento Kings foundation prior to my role at the Kings I worked for the National Basketball Association in New York for five years working with all teams across the nation and saw a number of successful implementations of 50/50 raffle bills amongst those teams who were able to do a lot of good in their communities through the benefits of these bills as a from the Sacramento Kings Foundation just in this past year we touched over 1100 local charities who did a lot of good in the community that is our mission and we ask that you put this bill in motion as soon as possible so that we can do a lot more good in the community all incremental all additive to what we're currently doing and we ask for your aye vote thank you mr. chair members of the committee markup Raya on behalf of AEG and their teams the Los Angeles Kings in the Los Angeles Galaxy we urge your aye vote the current system does not provide sufficient incentive to the sports fans to participate in the raffles this measure will and will ultimately benefit the the charities and the youth groups with which were affiliated we are drive out okay any additional testimony in support I see some in the back please state your name organization and support position curtain lorna greece representing Military Officers Association of America we support this bill mr. chairman members of the committee my name is dawn Harper I'm with the American Legion Department of California we have a hundred twenty-five thousand members and in this great state and we support this bill thank you good afternoon Lorraine Plass AM vets Department of California American Veterans is the third largest veterans group in the United States and we support this bill to help our nonprofit efforts thank you michaei Carney on behalf of the San Jose Sharks in the sharks foundation in support john benton on behalf of jr. blind in support okay thank you for your testimony do we have any testimony in opposition here today seeing some please approach [Music] good afternoon chairman gray members of the committee senator Hall my name is Jennifer fairing and I'm the Sacramento advocate for Cal nonprofits a statewide policy Alliance of nearly 10,000 organizations representing and promoting California's growing nonprofit sector the primary purpose of Cal nonprofits and the reason our organizations are members is to work to bring the full power of nonprofits to strengthening communities by speaking with the voice of California nonprofits to the legislature government agencies philanthropy and the public we recognize and appreciate that some nonprofit organizations with ties to professional sports teams support this bill but Cal nonprofits opposes SB 549 because it will create charity haves and have-nots at the whim of owners of professional sports teams and their foundations that's neither fair nor in the nonprofit sectors broader interest before 2001 nonprofits in California could not legally conduct raffles at all count on profits participated in a multi-stakeholder process that changed state law through a voter approved initiative which allowed nonprofits to use raffles as fundraisers as long as 90 percent of the gross receipts from a raffle are directed to beneficial and charitable purposes this 90/10 raffle provision has allowed all charities to hold raffles and raise much-needed funds to support their mission based activities but SB 549 would create a carve-out with special rules for an exclusive set of nonprofit organizations affiliated with major league sports teams nine leagues that are specifically named in the bill and only these organizations would be authorized to conduct raffles where 50% of raffle receipts can be awarded to a winner all other charities school bands symphonies 4-h clubs FFA s humane societies Rotary clubs food banks and all the rest of us would be limited to the current ninety ten rules whether they preferred or not that means that the Red Cross chapter SPCA human services agency Sportsman's Club veteran group or any other organization that you care about in your district would be violating state law if they conducted a 50/50 organ raffle and they would have to rely on being in the vicinity and the good graces of a professional sports teams foundation to benefit from this change in law regardless of their own ability or interest in conducting such a raffle themselves count on profits is joined by members like the knot Napa Valley Community Foundation the Modesto Bay Center for Human Services the association of California Symphony Orchestra's housing California meals-on-wheels of San Francisco the Santa Barbara Community College Foundation and the United Way of Kern County in opposition to SB 549 we respectfully urge our no vote and I'm joined today by Seamus roller a member of the Cal nonprofits Board of Directors good afternoon chairman gray members of the committee and senator Hall my name is Seamus roller I'm a non-profit executive director and a board member of Cal nonprofits I serve on the policy committee which voted unanimously to oppose SB 549 earlier this year our report causes count that came out of Cal nonprofits details how there are 72,000 nonprofits in California it's the fourth largest industry in California responsible for 15% of the gross domestic product of California employs nearly 1 million people that survey indicated that nonprofits have a very strong reputation in California to act on the public interest and deliver quality services in addition to the concerns that Jennifer raised let me also add that I think that SB 549 as runs the risk of eroding the public's trust in nonprofit organizations current law ensures that the primary purpose of any raffle is to provide charity and provide benefit to the nonprofit organizations raffles with a 50/50 split move away from that primary purpose and may inadvertently put more of a focus on gambling to win a cash prize rather than on a benefit and a donation to a nonprofit organizations as a non-profit and having worked my entire career nonprofits we're always looking to limit the amount spent on administrative overhead and on fundraising this allows 50 percent of the funds to be spent on fundraising on any donation in addition to any administrative costs for the nonprofit our role at Cal nonprofits is to look at the ways in which we can serve all been on profits in the sector's best interest as a whole and as that we believe that any laws should benefit the entire sector and not just a handful of organizations that are you know the beneficiaries of you know the support of public sports franchises so where you respectfully request your no vote on SB 549 David Quintana on behalf of the Palo Band of Mission Indians and the VA house band Akuma Indians we have a very very specific opposition we are opposed unless amended right now the regular under the current bill the regulatory oversight is complaint driven for these venue for these events I believe we would remove our opposition if there was a standing regulatory oversight for each event especially when the gaming events are of the size that are I believe envisioned by the author and and the proponents so if we had existing or standing oversight at each event I believe that that would be enough to make us feel comfortable but currently if it's only complaint driven given that tribes have three levels of regulatory oversight for our gaming endeavors we have to oppose mr. chair first of all car rooms and casinos are complaint driven as well so any gambling entity is a complaint driven so this is not unique to anything that mr. Quintana with all due respect as associate is-is-is has participated in I mean he is very much aware that casinos and car clubs and and tribes all of the complaints are are driven by someone calling and complaining and then they go out to inspect so it's the same with this as it is with the tribes and with the car clubs and for my witness from the nonprofit you know what she saying ain't hitting on nothing with senator Hall she needs to get some knowledge because all of the nonprofit's that she speaking of are in more affluent communities the majority not to folks and the most of the lower socioeconomic communities the poor people watts Compton where Rudy Salas ents where Henry Perea represents people who need as much public assistance or nonprofit assistance as they can possibly get and for these people to fly in on their million-dollar kites and to land in the Committee of geo and said do not help poor people is an embarrassment and an indictment to the public service that I dedicated my life to I'm not asking for a comment I'm making a statement I was brought here by the people of California particularly the people of my district to represent all people rich and poor those who have a hand and those who need a hand up I understand that some people who are not used to being in environments where people are hungry can oppose such things that help people that are hungry I'm very clear I'm very clear that and I don't blame you you live in your silo but I live in my reality and the reality is is that people in poor communities are hungry resources are very limited and thank God we have organizations that are willing to give struggling nonprofit organizations an opportunity to have it hanza thank God we have organizations that's willing to help veterans American legions uf bretons of Foreign Wars and so forth who have served this country you go back home to their legions their clubs and their clubs are struggling closing up around the state of California and I'm sorry you're saying that they don't deserve the support that these organizations are willing to do well I wouldn't be standing here if I can't support and advocate for the disenfranchised for the least of these and for those who are struggling particularly in the most lower socio Eakin communities and so I respectfully ask for your aye vote Thank You senator we'll take that as your close that is my close and any questions from the members mister solace Thank You mr. chairman senator Hall good to have you back in as a former chairman appreciate that good to see you and I know you are a man of passion and a faith and I believe that you are deigned as such and that kind of came out and drew close and so do appreciate that somewhat and also you know going back to you to the question of equity and making sure everybody's covered I know you have a lot of support folks around the table as well but are you willing to work with the committee to ensure that there's I guess uh enough equity kind of being applied so when these raffles are being done that it's not just profiting maybe the Los Angeles of the world or San Diego or San Francisco some of those larger cities but some of like you had mentioned in your statement as well some of us that represent some of the rural areas in California or inland California for instance that don't have major league cities where we can you know help with that charity and and there's a lot of nonprofits out there and I'd hate to see this bill be tailored only do those nonprofits in those major cities but something that would help provide equity for all the struggling communities throughout California absolutely and thank you for the question and the bill outlines nonprofit organizations across the state and in small and large cities such as your city Fresno is represented and in your district your district is represented in this bill and most cities in this entire on this board on this panel are represented and we can go through the majority but we are certainly open to dialogue and to work with the committee and make sure that if there are any questions regarding areas or locales where districts feel like they're being on represented we'll be able to address them Thank You senator now I appreciate that I know I did see a reporting requirement in the bill but obviously we always have oversight yeah and by the way this has a three-year sunset and the report will be coming back to this committee the DL J would do a report back to this committee in three years and you will be able to say okay how has this impacted our community has this worked where did the resources come from where did they go did it help this nonprofit that's not proper what region of the state did it help did it support is it something we want to move forward is it something we want to can so there is some accountability there's a report that will be coming back to this honorable board in three years it's a sunset clause in here well thank you for your commitment with that I'll move the bill thank you mr. Linder thank you Thanks do the author you brought a very challenging bill that by but by no means love but but I it's brought some interesting challenges I I think I think that what the opposition said there's a lot of Merit to I I think that it isn't indeed isn't very fair that it only only can can happen if you attach a name to a major sports team I think that that that that brings bring some I don't know it's like I said it just seems that it's a little unfair but at the same time you know to apply it all over the place is is a massive expansion and I think that that needs to be thought about too as well as the how its enforced so it's a very challenging bill for me and what I'm I'm going to end up supporting it though because at the end of the day even though it's even though I don't think it's perfect the the winner is the people that need the money and and that's a lot more important than then a lot of a you know then a lot of other things so I appreciate that you can count on my support for this thank you thank you sir mr. jones-sawyer and obviously I extremely ecstatic that your brain is for as the I like to call myself the first author that's her idea of 1691 I know the challenges that you're you're going through right now you and I work very hard to get it out of your committee geo unfortunately it was held in appropriations and hopefully fortunately you get out of here if it goes to appropriations hopefully we've got a good Dodger fan that can get it out of the other so we move this on but the thing that bothered me the most is is it's really the opposition and the things that they're saying because at the end of the day you and I both know we bent over backwards to deal with all the opposition's concerns right and put amendments to deal with all of it and it still was know and it was killed in appropriations for no really good reason we've had the San Francisco Giants become world champion and we had the Golden State Warriors become world champions can imagine amount of money that could have gone in those underserved communities in Richmond in the San Francisco area where we know there's a tremendous need that didn't happen that didn't happen because people became myopic and it kind of Mimi where's my money kind of attitude or just don't want it and there's nothing absolutely nothing and no matter how much you bend over backwards to satisfy them and so as the bill we just had before it had this long discussion about helping children in tobacco cessation at the end of the day something was proposed that wasn't 100% perfect but it would have brought some relief somewhere and we didn't do anything I wouldn't I would hope that this committee any appropriations committee and when we get it on the floor and hopefully on to the governor's desk that we understand how many people were actually gonna help with your bill and we could always expand it to include others because I think we even discussed minor league teams and it but the opponents hated it so much we had to shrink it down our bill had always been and your bill and mine were always been to be inclusive to reach every part of California and so I commend you on sticking with it I know you and I probably know better than anybody else on this committee how difficult it is to do the right thing and so I hope that everybody we'll do the right thing and vote for this - thank you thank you Thank You mr. mr. steinorth Thank You mr. chairman I also would like to express my support I am excited about this bill I'm encouraged but I also like to echo how I'd like to see a commitment of having this expanded I represent the city of San Bernardino and as we know there are no major sports teams within the vicinity of the city of San Bernardino but we have a tremendous amount of schools we have educational institutions we have other nonprofit organizations that would really love the opportunity to participate in a very similar fashion to this opportunities you're presenting for these you know national sports teams or based here in California of course so I the commitment from the author and allures from my colleague at the dice here that we continue to carry this conversation forward I'd be very grateful thank you and you have my commitment thank you and I don't deliver empty promises mr. Garcia I think it was a chair senator thank you for bringing this bill forward in the last five minutes in this conversation I've received a couple of emails from some nonprofits in Imperial County and as you know Imperial County is probably in the list of one of the poorest counties in California with the concerns regarding this bill I'll be supporting the bill because I think there is a tremendous amount of potential to help poor communities throughout the state with this legislation moving forward but the concern that was brought forward as the unequal playing field and this is coming from a food bank in peril County in peril Valley Food Bank which you know works really hard to make sure that we can get people out of poverty and when they raised a concern I thought it'd be important that I raise that issue because I think it echoes much of the comments that we've heard here to make sure that we're far more inclusive moving forward so thank you thank you okay do we have any additional comments from the members miss Waldron Thank You mr. chairman thank you so much for this bill and for all the good things that it does and I know it does as someone who represents seven federal recognized tribes that are basically uncertain and some opposed I'm just gonna lay off but thank you we haven't received in the opposition but for the to that mr. Quintana most tribes are neutral on the bill thank you okay seeing no additional questions mr. chairman I too will be supporting the bill today you have a do pass recommendation from me I thank you for your work but I do want to echo mr. salsas comments and others and I think the most important point you raise is that we have a sunset on this bill and this body is going to have an opportunity not just throughout the duration of this process and throughout the duration of the committee process here at the legislature but upon review of this - to see what's working and what perhaps can be improved at that time thank you for your work and commitment and your passion and with that secretary please call the roll great aye great I'll endure Linder aye Achadjian aye Achadjian aye Alejo Alejo aye Bigelow Bigelow aye Campos Campos aye I Cooper Cooper aye Daly Cristina Garcia Eduardo Garcia Eduardo Garcia aye Gibson Hernandez John Sawyer aye John Sawyer aye Levine Levine aye mace mace I Priya Salas Salas aye Priya aye Stein North Stein North I Waldron not voting woke woke I so did that bill is out thank you Thank You members thank you okay at this time we're going to move to Senator McGuire item ten please approach and present SB six eight five you have a do pass recommendation from the chair on this side second you have a motion and a second senator would you like to close don't make it up very grateful for your support and an amazing presentation I have to say very good support in opposition [Music] hasn't been updated since then and we need to open our posts up to more veterans urge an aye vote a thank you any other additional support comments yes mr. chair dawn Harper again with American Legion Department California we think this is a good bill to help keep the veteran halls open and the vets go to go to places the vets halls so we need to keep these halls open and this is a good bill miracle agent supports it thank you me too American veterans learn plus state legislative chair we support law degrees Military Officers Association of America we strongly support ok thank you for testimony any testimony in opposition seeing none we'll take your comments as you're close senator secretary please call the roll great all right great islander Linder aye Achadjian asaji and i Alejo Alejo aye Bigelow Bigelow aye Campos Campos aye I Cooper Daley Cooper aye Daly Cristina Garcia Eduardo Garcia Eduardo Garcia aye Gibson Hernandez Joan Sawyer Joan Sawyer aye Levine Levine I'm ace Maes i priya priya i Salas Salas aye stein north Stein north I Waldron Waldron I will Wilk aye senator your bill is out thank you so much mr. chair and members very grateful thank you sir very good senator Lara welcome to the Geo Committee please approach and present your legislation move the bill second we have a motion from mr.

osYSbvh-2Js,CA,03-15-2016,okay call the committee of higher education to order and we will begin as a subcommittee our uh first item mr quirk thank you mr chair members imagine a student who is a member of a university club and another student makes you feel be littered belittled and helpless by sexually harassing her the arrest students decides to speak out an informs university lecturer that she knows the lecturer instead of making her feel supported by reporting the incident to the appropriate official reports this incident to the club's faculty advisor the faculty advisor comes to conclusion that no frozen further action is necessary because the student has decided to quit the club no reports are made and the offended student is not reprimanded the student in an effort to avoid the harasser withdraws from an other social activities and collegiate opportunities approximately one year later the offending student sexually harasses her again members there are parents at san diego state university who don't have to imagine this scenario because this is exactly what happened to their daughter this is why i'm authoring a b 1778 this measure will require that all staff at institutions of all institutions of higher learning who accept state financial aid and are trained annually on how to report to and report incidents of sexual assault domestic violence dating violence and stalking involving a student when students experience sexual violence they are likely to report the incident to a trusted coach or resident advisor at their campus unaware this person may not be adequately trained to appropriately report and support the victim the lack of all-inclusive annual training may lead to mismanagement of these incident reports and may inadvertently discourage students from reporting these incidents california can and must do a better job of protecting students from further trauma on college campuses i respectfully request your i vote thank you mr quirk uh any witnesses in support and and before you begin uh let me before you start let me have the secretary call the role medina present baker bloom chavez irwin joan sawyer levine linder lowe olson santiago weber williams uh quorum is president so we are now in committee hi jill rice with the california federation of teachers we come in support of this bill although we're suggesting to the author some technical amendments that would ensure that our members of faculty and classified who are obligated reporters or mandated reporters could transfer that training between their campuses and districts many of our members work at multiple sites and to ensure they wouldn't go through the training multiple times so that would be the first suggested amendment the second suggested amendment and again we are in support of the purpose of this bill is to ensure that if this is mandated for the employees that they are compensated for their time so for our part-time faculty that are not salaried and are paid for the hours they work that that is compensated time other than that we're in absolute support of the bill and applaud the author for this important piece of legislation thank you any other witnesses and support any witnesses in opposition any comments or questions from uh members miss baker thank you mr chairman and thank you mr quirk for this very good bill we as this committee came together last year and supported legislation to bring more rigor to the protection of students when there are sexual assault claims on campus involving students and we should expect absolutely the same of of management we do this to employers in california if you have more than 50 employees your management is required to have training and in in harassment policies and our faculty should be setting not just barely meeting that standard but being a higher model at standard and so i appreciate that you've brought forward this bill and very pleased to be voting for it today thank you thank you any other questions or comments from members if not that's a good question based i i hope i heard correctly this is not just for management right this is for all employees right because management is including including maintenance workers whoever might come in contact with the students see something that's gone wrong and then would know how to report it okay because management has always had to do this you have to do it every year when i was at state so it sort of applies to others that's good that's correct thank you and there's an easy method they use now in the system because it's all online yeah so it shouldn't cost that much thank you thank you there was a motion by miss baker second by dr weber uh if the secretary to call the roll medina aye medina i baker baker i bloom bloom i chavez irwin jones sawyer joan sawyer i levine levine i linder low low i olson olson not voting santiago weber weber i williams williams i uh dr quirk uh your motion your bill uh passes will keep the roll open for members to add on thank you mr chair thank you our second item uh assemblymember mccarty ab-1594 thank you [Music] okay 1594 first correct okay thank you mr chair and members i'm pleased to present ab-1594 which would create a statewide policy for smoke-free campuses in california and prohibit persons for smoking or using tobacco products on our university campuses including the community colleges csu system and the uc system uh current smoking anti-smoking policies at csu and uc and community colleges are somewhat haphazard um we know that the research and the statistics show that uh smoking is certainly is dangerous to individuals leading cause of cancer heart disease and other serious ailments and second hand smoke can lead to strokes as well recognizing the serious health effects some campuses already do this as i mentioned earlier at the uc system they have such a policy at our csu they're starting there at our community colleges about one-fifth of the campuses have such a policy and this would create a uniform statewide standard and we think make our college campuses a safe and healthier place for higher learning i i appreciate some of the questions and suggestions raised in in the analysis and will really address those uh moving forward focusing on specific strategies for policy compliance as well as dealing with who specifically would administer the uh penalties and fines and so forth with me today are the american cancer society network and a nurse from sacramento city college thank you hi i'm tim gibbs with the american cancer society cancer action network and we support the bill i'd also like to note that my colleagues at the american heart association and american lung association have asked me to publicly state their organization's support as well smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in both men and women lung cancer kills over 13 000 californians every year and one out of three cancer deaths is due to tobacco the u.s surgeon general has declared that there's no risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke and even brief exposure to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse health effects in adults and children restricting tobacco use in college campuses is an important strategy in preventing young people from becoming lifelong smokers the american cancer society has 37 colleges against cancer chapters in california 14 of whom would be directly impacted by this bill those chapters have played a really important role in passing smoke-free policies on their campuses however there's no uniformity at csus or california community colleges and protections for our students should not vary based upon where you decide to go to school the california department of public health has identified the adoption of 100 tobacco-free policies at community colleges one of the top strategies for reducing health disparities in california and our community colleges are very diverse and compared to four-year institutions uh students have much more much higher tobacco use rates so with that we respectfully ask for your iphone thank you i'm wendy gomez i'm a college nurse for sacramento city college and we wholeheartedly support this bill sacramento city college became a designated smoking areas two years ago and will become smoke tobacco and vape free this fall for three main reasons and the three main reasons uh that we support this bill is that secondhand smoke is dangerous as he suggested it can exacerbate health conditions of other people such as asthma bronchitis copd and can even cause a heart attack according to the american lung association the second reason is that smoking is an unhealthy coping mechanism that leads to addiction college students are under a lot of stress and they're looking for a way to cope with that stress and part of our goal as a college is to teach them healthy coping strategies that is not one the goal the third reason is the goal of the community colleges it's to prepare individuals to go into the workforce or to go on to a four-year college and most likely those career choices or the four-year college is going to be a smoke-free environment so they're coming from a k-12 situation where there is not smoking allowed then we let them smoke at the community college level and then they go on to a four-year college and now they've got an addiction they've got to deal with because they can't smoke on that college or they're going to a career where they cannot smoke as well and so for those reasons and many other health reasons that are obvious we would support this bill witnesses and support good afternoon members betsy armstrong on behalf of the county health executives association representing california's local health departments in strong support good afternoon jp sheri you have one of my best nurses here with you today we support this bill for the los rios community college district hi my name is laurie jones i'm director of legislative affairs for the associated student body for american river college and i'm here today representing our tobacco smoke and vape free task force to urge and i vote and we are newly uh free of all of the above as of january 1st thank you good afternoon ashley wicklund on behalf of the american heart and american stroke association in support any witnesses in opposition not seeing any any questions or comments from members ms olsen thank you mr chair i don't have a problem with the subject matter of the bill per se but generally speaking i think we should be supportive of the independence of our higher education institutions they have boards that make decisions like these so every now and then there are overriding reasons that the state should get involved but can you explain to me why you think this is so important for the state legislature to interfere in what the normal process would be as opposed to allowing the community college system and the csu system to do this on their own sure i know we have independent elected boards at almost 100 community colleges but i think public health is paramount in a safe place to be healthy and and learn and the institution of higher education i think raises this issue for having a statewide policy and the csu board of trustees the csu board of trustees they don't have a position on this they're leaning towards us anyway they're about to do this and so i think if we didn't have the bill there's probably policy there the csu in the next number of months or years and uh um we've been working with them in consultation and i don't think that we have any concerns from that end thank you uh if i see no other comments or questions um entertain a motion bill moved by mr lowe second by mr levine uh madam secretary if you had called the bro medina aye medina i baker baker i bloom bloom i chavez irwin irwin i joan sawyer joan sawyer i levine levine i linder linderno low low i olson olsen no santiago weber weber i williams williams eye okay okay 9-2 your bill gets out i'll keep the roll open for uh absent members thank you thank you and we'll go now to uh somebody member mccarty's second bill okay uh item three a b 17 11. one second ready ready okay thank you mr chaired members i'm pleased to present my second bill ab-1711 which seeks to increase access for californians at our university of california system as you probably know it's been a growing trend for the uc system to enroll more out of state international students non-residents frankly at the expense of california students this started the last 5-10 years during the the budget crunch and frankly during those times i think it was appropriate uc system had to do anything to keep the lights on i think going forward as we've stabilized the uc system this sets a fair policy going forward to make sure we don't ration access to our higher education segment the university of california last year our budget process recognized this issue and increased funding for the uc for five thousand more california students in providing funding to do so in partnership with the uc however this past year we realized that uc actually admitted fewer first-time california residents at the uc system by sixteen hundred students at the same time increasing out-of-state uh residents by about forty seven hundred students and as you as you kind of see by the charts since 2007 over the last nine years actually california freshmen there are fewer californians in the uc system entering as a freshman 2015 2 decrease whereas non-resident students have have increased uh 335 so um the the notion that non-resident students helps increase access for california students the math just just doesn't add up and so we're setting forward a policy here that frankly isn't a new one as the agenda states in 2010 the regents even agendize setting a cap of a 10 policy for non-resident students now we're up at about 15 and a half percent uh system-wide as as you see in the in the in the in your analysis some of the some of the top campuses are north of 20 as far as non-resident students so so so we're setting a policy that would set aside a 15 and a half percent camp uh uh uc wide um there are some clarifications i i just want to to point out that we'll get there probably in the witnesses testify in opposition uh it's intention that this would set a statewide policy for the uc system and that it existing uc campuses would not have to decrease enrollment in other words ucla uc berkeley and uc san diego they wouldn't have to decrease enrollment but they have to stay at a 15 percent uh system-wide system-wide camp and we are we'll talk about later i am uh very open to sending a policy in the bill which would allow some of the campuses of the lower end of non-resident riverside merced santa barbara davis and irvine to potentially grow because they haven't been able to to achieve the same type of success that the the four marquee campuses have in the university of california system so i think this is a as a fair approach that focuses on um increasing access for for californians i do have a a parent here from the uc system whose kids want higher education who would like to share a few words as well good afternoon my name is jay michael my family moved here in 1966. the reason that the five michaels moved to sacramento is because my father actually was that employee of the uc system and three years later after that he became vice president i am a graduate of uc davis my brother is a graduate of cal my sister is a graduate of uc santa barbara and my father in fact went to cal in ucla for a master's degree and so i i hope that convinces you that i have blue and gold in my running through my blood and you're wearing it today indeed i am sir thank you for noticing uh i own a small uh property management firm in town and have for 27 years and so we have a one of our sons graduated from jesuit high school in 2013 a jesuit high school is one of sacramento's strongest regional high schools and he had a 3.5 gpa applied to uc davis san diego and santa barbara and got into none of them his ct scores were commensurate with a 3.5 he did however get into the university of washington which as i'm sure you know is a top tier university and so uh for that uh uh we are paying eleven thousand three hundred per quarter in tuition alone um we had saved in our 529 fund for a uc education and so the adjustment has been very difficult for us it's a it's a it's a big difference to make up and we're not happy about it in fact i'm very upset with uc about this uh difficult uh pendulum swinging the wrong way and in my case three generations of michaels have uh supported and funded uc the same is the truth with my with my wife's uh family and then when it times for it's time for our son to go to the uc there's no room this is on the heels of the uc president going to china to recruit their students to come here to take uh the california kids spaces and i'm i would remind you this is about freshmen and a baccalaureate degrees in my view graduate programs are another kettle of fish this has nothing to do with graduate programs so i would uh i can tell you that when i get calls now from uc davis as a alumni i i'm not giving a dime and neither are our friends who find themselves in the same situation they're very upset and if you think it's just the 59 and 60 year olds that are upset you would be wrong it's it's the grandparents as well because their grandchild was unable to go to to uc in in many cases and so i am i am here to urge a strong eye vote for ab1711 and uh i i hope that you give it serious consideration thank you i'd be happy to answer any questions thank you any other witnesses in uh support hi jill rice with the california federation of teachers and strong support any witnesses in opposition yeah chair members nadia lel carrillo at the university of california and we have a position of concern we recognize the concerns related to the university's enrollment of non-residents and i want to take this opportunity first to show and reiterate our commitment first to enroll more california residents in fact to the point that the author brought up about the under enrollment that occurred this year we are actually on track and prepared to enroll an additional 6 600 students california residents the president has also kept non-resident at three campuses and has directed the remainder campuses to slow down the rate of their non-resident enrollment however we continue to be concerned because of the and specifically to the cap proposed in the bill we think that that's really going to hamper our ability to continue to provide a quality education so for this reason we urge you to continue to have in-depth discussions about ways that the university and the state can continue to partner to enroll more california residents and be that as part of your budget process so we hope that um we can continue to be a partner with you on this issue of mutual interest and we look forward to working with the author as the bill moves forward thank you thank you any other witnesses in opposition questions or comments from the members mr williams well i think that this is a really important problem that you are attempting to address but i do think that it is does not get at what the actual problem is the actual problem is that the legislature and the governor massively cut uc ncsu funding and yet we have sort of expected that there wouldn't be dramatic bad consequences for that cut and really the inadequate level that even after the recession when we restored some fundings that that has taken place we have still not restored uc funding to pre-recession levels it is still less than it was before the cuts and last year was the first year that we actually gave any money for enrollment increases so i i appreciate the subcommittee chair because he did try to get some mr mccarty as a member of the subcommittee i appreciate his role because he did try to get some funding for enrollment increases and we were successful in doing that last year but that's the first year so we approved it basically right before july they enroll students in august at uc berkeley and in september on the other campuses so i don't think it should be a shocking to any of us that they weren't able to turn around a month later or two months later and and implement the enrollment increase in its entirety if you look at that chart you'll notice that even in the after the cuts they kept freshman enrollment relatively constant you can't do that without money every uc student pays about twelve thousand dollars if there don't get financial aid but costs us about thirty thousand dollars right in total so eighteen eighteen thousand after the twelve thousand dollars if they're if they are a um a student on financial aid then they cost us more like the whole thirty thousand dollars and it is impossible for us to to maintain student in uh freshman enrollment when state funding is going down without them doing something else in this case they did something that is not great but it is functional which is to raise uh non-resident enrollment to subsidize that because they pay more right and they're used to subsidize not just programs on campus but for those of us that are concerned about low-income students that money is put back in financial aid in the entire system so not just the campuses that are high high non-resident enrollment but the money goes back for financial aid for everyone if we really want to solve this we'll give better than a four percent increase in this year's budget and solve it that way that would be the real way to solve it um i think it would be fun it would probably you know the the chair and mr mccarty did do important work on documenting which campuses and sort of an inequity between campuses and i think we could probably address that if we if the author wanted to by capping it at one or two campuses not at the entire system if god god forbid we have a recession next year or the year the year after and we've capped how much non-resident enrollment they can do that's going to hurt in-state student numbers not help them the uc is not a zero-sum game and how many seats it has it's a zero-sum game and how much money is available to subsidize students and so you're going after seats but the real problem is money um on most of these campuses they could grow if there was money but there's not money so i can't support it today uh i look forward to the author hopefully looking at a more concise bill that targets the actual problem ms olsen thank you mr tara i have a little bit of different take although i agree with my colleague from santa barbara that the real answer the more substantive answer would certainly be increasing funding for our csu and uc campuses and i believe the authors of the bill are also supportive of that effort i know it's something several of us have worked on together it's important to remember we were chatting earlier last year we were all claiming victory because we got four percent enrollment growth right four percent budget growth for our campuses which was great compared to where we've been over the last several years but if you look at k-12 or k-14 they've had over 50 percent budget growth in the last few years and so we absolutely have to continue increasing the state investment in our public universities if we're going to enroll more students and if we're going to improve outcomes but having said that the problem this problem highlighted in this chart existed before the devastating budget cuts began it has been a long time now that our ucs and csus have been dramatically increasing the number of non-resident students i know this firsthand i'm a former csu administrator and one of the reasons for it makes sense and i think you discussed this as well is if we're capturing those non-resident students theoretically they pay more and we can capture that additional tuition in order to increase the number of slots for in-state students which is great but at some point that stops working at some point you've gone so far and now we have a 335 percent increase in non-resident students that that no longer pencils out and the purpose of our csus and uc's at the end of the day is to give every california student who's eligible who's worked really hard in their under not their undergrad in their high school careers that they would have a slot at a csu or uc campus that is not happening today thousands thousands upon thousands of fully eligible students are being denied by our csu and uc campuses that is unacceptable it is in part a budget issue that we do need to address but that's not the entire issue and i think if we couple increased state investment in our universities with a bill like this we will go a long way to getting back to the master plan of higher education the promise that every california student can get a top quality education at one of our public universities so i am proud to support this bill i would be honored to be a co-author if it moves forward today i compliment you for carrying it and i hope it moves forward mr lee thank you mr chair and thank you mr mccarty for uh introducing this language which has really um stirred up a really important conversation and a conversation which i agree with both of the speakers that came before me mr williams and ms olsen every california student who qualifies for the csu or the uc should have a space for them when they graduate from high school that's just a fundamental belief that i have but the points made by mr williams about the the issue being the money that we have for them to be there is completely true and the next recession is coming our rainy day fund will not save us um and funding for our important institutions will continue to decline and as we see um with uc what they have done is completely rational for any organization that has been starved of resources and we've seen this actually over many years not just the recession where public investment in our institutions of higher education has gone down and we need to reverse that and we need to invest in our in our institutions of higher education again that is the challenge for us as the legislature to make that a priority in our budget and which i would completely support but i am concerned about the unintended consequence of uh shutting off funding for more students that uh that are actually from california from any of our campuses that may live in our community that want to go there and and so at this time i'm not able to support the legislation but thank you for stirring up this really important conversation ms baker thank you mr chairman thank you member mccarty i i echo these statements made eloquently by miss olson and and want to say i i've families come up to me in my district and say i'm i'm telling my kids to not even apply to uc because there's no place for them and it's very discouraging to hear that and these are families who who rose up uh to opportunity through going to uc i went to cal for law school my husband went there for undergrad we've had college counselors and high school counselors come to our office and visit with us time and again about how they are they are often discouraging students or trying to give them a very realistic point that regardless of your academic abilities there may not be a place for you and so i won't repeat the good statements that have been made i think mr williams is correct this can't possibly be and it isn't appropriate for this to be the only solution we've got to look at this both the funding both the reforms that you see in csu need to make as well as this as essential items for um addressing this issue we have to do it collaboratively and i think in a bipartisan way and and i would be honored to be added as a co-author is that something that is agreeable to you to be added as a co-author co-author uh i'll get to that with ms olson's question some others at this point mr medina and i aren't taking co-authors but we'll working on that down the road well i certainly hope you will uh particularly joint leadership of the committee uh bipartisan support mr mccarty for for the legislation and the need for for there to be a bipartisan unified solution on it so we'll be happy to follow up with your office on that i think it is um it's important all this is a major issue for uc and csu and all the major issues that face this date should be addressed in a bipartisan manner and look forward to working with you on this bill mr bloom thank you mr chair um i uh find myself in agreement with mr williams and mr levine on on on this particular issue and what i i think does it it doesn't follow that if we were to reduce out-of-state enrollment that we would then be able to increase in-state enrollment in fact revenue would drop and i haven't seen anyone show a pro provided pro forma that says that somehow there would be sufficient money for enrollment to increase so if our goal here is to increase enrollment i i'm just not convinced that this is the tool to do it uh in fact i think that it by by putting this kind of hard cap and reducing the flexibility of of of the segments could actually hamper their ability ability to provide additional slots we saw in the last year if i'm correct in the numbers in-state student enrollment increased by several thousand slots that clearly as a result of a number of things including the increase of funds and the prodding uh and then some of this committee and and others in the legislature in influencing the segments to to increase that local california enrollment i am very concerned that a um a hard cap of 15.5 percent uh will have the opposite impact that we're looking for here and i just will add one other comment um i haven't seen a discussion of whether we actually have the authority to do this also i think that's an important question mr chavez i appreciate all the comments made earlier and was all about but all the comments been talking about funding now um mr mccarty as you know in our hearing we had a number of discussions here on this and i've been pretty consistent in asking this one question and that is what is the when you're looking at a university what is the appropriate number of out-of-state residents to add the critical element of high-quality education expected at a university and for the members here we had asked this also of let's say universities like harvard or yale or other universities what percent did they bring in to have out-of-state residents so we've heard everything from 20 to 25 would be the right number to have a academic environment the high quality you'd like to see because as we know [Music] in a university it's not just learning from your professors it's learning from your your students so what you know what do we want to have in this diverse environment the best environment we could have for our students in the uc system so kevin mr carter have you determined a number is that you came up with 15 is is it driving by economics or is it being driven by the academic environment well as as far as the numbers for for diversity i mean california's universities are diverse not all from immigrant students there are californians who have diversity as well of course their parents or they could have been california residents after immigrating here as as youngsters but it really is to draw the line in the sand because we were at five percent then seven as miss olsen said even before the recession it would start inching up to what end the university of california on their own admission in 2010 they want to have a policy of 10 now we're at 15. so if we don't do anything even with increased revenue as mr williams said it is a budget piece too but since 2012 when prop 30 passed we we've increased funding four years in a row they've increased student fees our state support to the uc has increased with the general fund student fee revenues and cal grant revenues and they're still inching up every year to what end and so i think this really is is about access to the university of california for californians so what i hear i'm saying and correct me if i've heard wrong is that you drew a land you just grabbed a number because you saw it moving up and it's focused on finance is that correct the the the cap is based upon where they're at now and um it's not an arbitrary number it's okay they keep pinching up every year today we're at 15.5 so let's have the number right there and really to it to address the concerns of the uc and worcester mr bloom said um the intent of the bill and we'll we can clarify it in this community our next one is that we're not asking the campuses to decrease enrollment that those systems that are at 20 something percent and i categorically reject the notion this is going to hurt the university as far as money existing they're not going to have to decrease have decreased enrollments at those campuses but it would have you know for every at those campuses for every non-resident that they admit they would probably have to admit about three californians to stay at that same ratio and as you know um in our hearings we had the uc merced has a significantly different number than uc berkeley as far as out-of-state residents and the other issue that came up out of the meeting uh in our hearings before and the argument being we have a diverse state and that brings diversity to the campus itself that's confusing culture with race those are two different things so somebody here obviously bringing the culture from asia or europe or south america that it's not so much a race issue as a cultural issue which is different so until i hear an answer on what we want to do for the academic environment to me that's the central issue of the university it's not a monetary issue i'd agree with mr williams that we just need to put more money into it if that's what it is i would i'm more concerned about the quality of the education at our ucs and since i haven't heard anybody give me some study which is surprising to me because we've been asking this for two years now what is the right number i'm not willing to cap something at 15 just because that's where we are today so i won't be supporting this dr webber yes um thank you for uh bringing the bill forward and thanks to everyone for the conversation um i guess the the issue for me always with things like this is that this is a probably a very complex issue uh having been at the university all my life it feels like um a complex issue about where the balance need to be and where it shouldn't be and and whether or not a number capping is an appropriate thing versus other kinds of philosophical discussions i think last year we had the bill california first which was a bill that ensured every kid in california who qualified for the university of california csu a slot and then after that you deal with the enrollment of other students and which seems probably what everybody's talking about that you want every california kid to to basically be able to go to the uc if they qualify for the uc or the csu and i'm not sure if this bill does it by putting a cap on it it might but i don't i'm not sure if it does because you can cap it and still not have more slots because you haven't made a philosophical or financial commitment to every child in california who works hard and who qualifies for these institutions to get into those institutions and so it becomes a real complicated issue because it is an issue of of what our basic philosophy is it's an issue of our resources uh and um and how that balance is there as well as the academic issue because there are clear academic benefits of having uh foreign students in our campuses uh non-residents but particularly foreign students on our campuses because of what they bring academically and culturally to the campus than a level of enrichment that is really important for students a complete education and for our students to really interact with the rest of the world and that doesn't happen all the time and and you can see it with you on a campus that doesn't have a good mix of all kinds of students our kids have a tendency to see the world in very small ways and when they are interacting with others they have a tendency to broaden their horizon and really become world citizens which is very important and that's also why it's important for them to travel out of the country while they're there and so forth and so on um the the i want the conversation to continue so i'm tempted to vote for it because i want the conversation to continue because i think we haven't had enough of a conversation about this that's number one number two um i'm not even sure if you have the authority to tell you see anything be very honest about it so we're really just talking to csu which may not be the culprit in the room uh because we don't have the authority to to cap uc we have begged them to cap uh their things we beg them to do things and they comply and they work with us on some issues that they have in the last couple years due to holding of the budget but the reality is they are a separate entity uh and so when we start talking about capping you see and having uc do things you know most of our bills are our recommendations to the university of california so really the question is is this something designed for csu and many of our csu campuses don't have a lot of out-of-state students it's the more popular ones like san diego state uh and san francisco and a few others that actually have a large number of out of state students and benefit from that in terms of the money that they bring in and we have that ongoing ballot san diego state all the time because it's a very popular campus for a lot of students around the world who want to come and it makes it difficult for the local students to enroll at san diego state versus some of the others but this is probably and maybe i hope you can address this whether or not because i think sometimes we pass things and then we get frustrated when it's all over because we thought we did something that we didn't do and that was to try to cap the university of california and we don't really have that authority i don't i don't think we do and i've looked into it a little bit when we've tried to do other things so maybe you can address that um mr mccarty in terms of what our role would be if this were to pass what would our role be in control of the uc campus um and i know we've struggled with it at the budget level and all other kinds of levels that are there so i don't want us to believe that we've done something profound in this room only to discover that we are not able to we can only implement this with regards to the csu system and not the university of california because of state constitution so it'd be interesting to know exactly what this would actually do for the uc campus that's there and then um and whether or not capping the 15 would actually and i too wondered when i saw the 15.5 i thought okay what does that mean i don't know how we arrived at 15.5 um is that we just took the average of where we are now and okay maybe we should be at 10 versus 15. i don't know whether you've had conversations about the actual number uh but i know we have a crisis uh and we're trying to find a way to basically make the campuses more desirable or open to all of our students who really qualify for it and and they used to do that and they don't anymore as our campuses have become more competitive not only statewide but nationally and internationally it's very hard to cap the ucs and the berkeleys and the other in the ucsd and others that have these uh attractive curriculums and programs so have you given any thought to why we're at 15 and what our real role is with regards to uc whether or not this would really cap uc sure well i'll just talk about the the uh the main issue with uc and the constitutionality of it true they are autonomous in the united states constitution but as the bills written as a state's analysis it's it's as a condition upon receipt of funds appropriate in the budget so it's tied to the budget appropriation and as you as mr chavez mentioned we're having this exact parallel conversation in the budget with the enrollment for the uc as well and so we see that it's a nice tablet as a as a parallel uh you know conversation in in state policy and having the legislature weigh in but also talking about it in the budget as far as the number does the budget mean that they would not get increased that we would we would freeze their budget we would give no money i mean what does that mean basically as a condition of receiving the state appropriation the following conditions would apply so it's kind of like budget bill language that that's that that specifies how the uc appropriation would would have to be allocated so we would not fund them we would but we would say as we fund them we expect you to have enrollment policies which which are in accord with the following um ratios for non-resident students and californians okay but would that mean they wouldn't be funded then that's what i'm i'm asking because in the past when we've had language like this it was tied to an increase or we didn't say we're not fun you know your appropriations is dependent upon this which means then you have no funding at all if they if they don't do the 15.5 and they do the 17. mr mccarty could i add i'd like to add just a tangent to that to that question that in previous budget years before we as legislators got here the budget designated how much enrollment increase uc would have dependent on the budget so as the budget came out correct it was specified in the budget how much enrollment growth there would be and i believe it was california students i believe but that was shared with with me by the uh mac taylor legislative analyst uh so in in that we you know that would be uh something that we could go back to yeah correct i don't want all of a sudden do it sub two hearing here but we used to have budget targets right and we'd specify in the schwarzenegger administration department of finance got rid of those and our goal is to bring those back in addition set aside a policy with a ratio of non-resident resident and your bigger question is why why 15 it is somewhat of an arbitrary number but it's the number we're at today today we're at 15 and a half percent of the system is non-resident out of state new yorkers nevadans are international and the other you know eighty four and a half percent are are californians and so the the the policy question is is is that the damage has been done if you want to say did they the uc had to do it i acknowledge that you know we were they had no other choice to to turn the lights on but to do this and so i guess this acknowledges that question is it okay when do we say enough is enough and we should have a policy going forward you know that sets a fair standard mrs baker i i think there have been some great questions raised today by our colleagues i think the the better pa it's good to have this as a policy bill and not just through the budget process that we should set a policy i think it should be in in a bipartisan way um i think this is a good bill i will hold off for now until we can work out the possibility of a bipartisan co-authorship that i know myself and miss olsen would like to do and um and look forward to the other conversations that colleagues have that they've raised today thank you ms olsen thank you mr chair i'm going to be a little bit stronger than that it is fascinating to me that we have a lack of interest in bipartisan support for a bill it's the first time in my six years in the assembly i've heard that expressed in a committee hearing so um i i think i agree i like the policy i think it should be coupled with increased funding i think that would make it a stronger policy so i suggest we work on a bipartisan bill those who are interested in the policy aspects of it coupled with increased funding for the systems i'll be abstaining mr williams so i and you know i just want to reiterate i don't like the policy unless it's uh trumped by a lot more um uh uh uh funny you know let's put this in context we cut them by 100 by by hundreds of millions of dollars we want we ask them we all like half the people in this room have asked them to give raises to their employees myself included we we we they give employees raises and yet we expect them to do it with higher wages less money and enroll more students i mean am i missing something here you know um the the and when unless we think be shocked by 15 out of states uh uh percentage out of state students that is not ideal to me i think we should try to get that lower but most higher institutions of higher education have much higher than that that's low right just go surf the internet any private institution in the state or any out of state public institution and you will find higher out-of-state numbers and so i just i just feel like this is kind of like pile on on right um if we want enrollment increases we should pay for enrollment increases it's not that hard mr mccarty yeah i just wanted to maybe close and respond to the issue that mr williams and mr bloom raised that we could have another recession that that's correct and i think that the committee analysis alluded to this issue and suggested that we have some type of a trigger in there which basically would allow this policy to to exist or to lift this condition if we had some you know major budget action that required us to take a second look so i i'm open to accepting that i'm willing to to to work on language with committee staff that that basically addresses that that last comment um in there and then you know this is a really nuanced and complicated issue do you have questions i do yeah and uh if if you look at the frankly if you look at the uc system there's ten campuses there's really nine because the tenth one or the tenth is one the merced in your area but but the the one in san francisco is not undergraduates it's it's a teaching hospital so there's nine so there are three that have really high out of state non-resident enrollment berkeley ucla and san diego the all north of 20 21 23 and 24. uh the bottom three not saying on the bottom three camps nonetheless merced santa cruz and riverside all have um you know three uh seven and three right and so the middle uh irvine davis and santa barbara 16 12 and 11 they're right about that 15. so those those those campuses really wouldn't really be affected by this 15 a little bit um you know you you see irvine's right there maybe davis and san and santa barbara want to grow up a little bit to 15. um so i i think going forward the chancellor or the president's already said as you mentioned earlier in your testimony we're capping it at the three we're saying no more that we've heard it loud and clear from our regents from our community we can't keep doing this so it's really what do you do with those middle campuses and the ones at the bottom end so i think going forward i'm very open to coming up with a policy that has you know maybe a a goal but allows merced and santa cruz and riverside to grow to grow and get some of this non-resident participation and potentially those middle campuses to grow as well and with the three that are already at that level specify that they wouldn't lose any current enrollment funding that they wouldn't have to decrease but not below their current 24 21 23 and 24 respectively and and clarify that they could enroll more um non-residents at that same ratio but they'd have to stick at that ratio so for every you know one non-resident an equal number of three or so uh californians and so with that i hope that answers um the questions and issues and um uh certainly ask for your eye votes and uh i'm not we're not mr medina and i talked about this we don't want to commit to taking any co-authors today at that the i wanted to ask you uh mr mccarthy if you would not or if you would uh keep it in mind that you we want to see the legislation moving forward uh your bill moving forward uh i wanted to give you an opportunity to add uh co-authors at this time and keeping in mind that we want to see the bill moving forward okay so you're the author you're that you're the joint author but you're the principal author so my question to you is if you would be open to at this point for for for co-authors and keeping in mind that we'd like to see the the bill move forward um could we um could i i can move it right now as is and then we'll see how it goes yeah we haven't taken a vote yet yes right we don't have a motion yet um i have comments and then maybe i'll ask my question again motion mr lowe second miss irwin second by ms irwin i i'm sorry that the students of pali high school uh had to leave uh pali high school was the high school where i taught for 20 years they were here in the audience and they met with me this morning as did students high school seniors from valverde unified two groups of students and and the my own pali high school students i i would say shared with mr michael their concern their concern how difficult it is to be accepted by uc uh today and i shared with them that the legislation that we did last year and the uh the condition that we put on uc with the 25 million dollars in extra funding that uc would now be accepting 5 000 now up to 6 600 makes it a good time to be a high school senior looking to uc acceptance uh but i share mr michael's frustration i was a uc graduate myself my brother was a graduate of bolt hall but it's become more difficult but i think that the discussion that we've had here has been the best discussion that i've heard in the three years that i've been here for the need for more funding for uc i understand and agree with mr williams that we cannot at the same time and i've been saying that for a while complain about the outcomes but not do anything different uh on funding but i'm concerned i'm concerned we're where we are now um i'm concerned that you see you know we gave them uh we gave them that uh requirement and then you know maybe they didn't have enough time but they didn't move in the right direction so therefore mr mccarty and i shared the deep concern about the direction we're going so my my recommendation is support i will vote and favor but i want to give mr mccarty another opportunity to think about whether he wants to open it up for co-authors at this time i will move the bill as as written and uh as uh potentially with with the suggestion if if their staff wants to help with the uh but the trigger in the in the budget crisis type situation and go with that okay thank you so we had a motion by mr lowe as second by miss irwin madame secretary if you'd call the roll medina aye medina i baker baker not voting bloom bloom not voting chavez chavez no erwin irwin i jones sawyer jones sawyer i levine levine not voting lender lender not voting low low i olson santiago weber i wanted to go forward the conversation saw vodi weber i williams no williams now the vote is five two two uh the measure is not out we will keep the roll open okay we'll go to item four mr banter good afternoon mr chair and members today i'm pleased to present ab1726 which is the accounting for health and education in api demographics act or the ahead act this bill will reveal important health and education disparities of ethnic subgroups in the api community california is home to the nation's largest asian american and second largest native hawaiian and pacific islander populations there are more than 23 distinct communities within the asian american population and 19 within the native hawaiian and pacific islander population each of our diverse communities has unique social economic and educational needs that must be addressed differently instead of lumping many api communities together under the catch-all other asian category the ahead act would identify api subgroups that are being left behind the head act specifically requires the state departments of public health and health care services and our public higher education institutions to use additional categories for each major asian and pacific islander group in the state of california under these requirements the state will collect critical data for public health and agent and education outcomes on california's fastest growing bangladeshi hmong indonesian malaysian fijian pakistani sri lankan taiwanese tongan and thai populations the data unveiled by the ahead act will allow policy makers government agencies and community groups to better and more effectively serve the entirety of our diverse api community some of you may have been on the committee uh last year we had a similar bill with a different number uh that passed out of this committee i appreciated the conversation then and i'm honored to be able to present this bill this year and respectfully ask for i vote i have with me witnesses i have sirian villa vicencio chair of the california commission on asian and pacific islander american affairs and professor of political science at san joaquin delta college and i also have pacu her student at the sacramento state full circle project move the bill begin thank you um good afternoon chairman medina um and honorable members of this esteemed committee thank you again for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of assemblymember bontes ab1726 um i come before you today uh to uh lend my support to this bill because of two reasons one to demystify the idea that asians are a model minority and to second to show that asian americans and pacific islanders are not a monolithic group as assembly member bonte mentioned according to the u.s census this our community is a group that made is made up of over 30 distinct cultures and languages with varied backgrounds and experiences it may seem on the surface that asian americans are doing well i have some data for you asian americans are the best educated group in the country about 50 of adults holding bachelor's degrees are higher compared to 29 of americans overall but when you disaggregate the data it tells a very different story for example when you disaggregate the data for uh southeast asians less than one of five cambodians hmong and low asians earn a bachelor's degree compared to one of three average americans there was a study that was conducted at uh fresno state a few years back by gong kubo in takahashi 2013 that when you in fact disaggregate the data it revealed that among apia ethnic groups it revealed that 97 percent of hmong students were not only first generation college students but also came from larger households 6.8 on average and 62 percent from lower income households combined incomes of less than 24 000 dollars a year if you look at the white house initiative on asian americans and pacific islanders when they collaborated with the u.s census bureau a few years back to disaggregate the data to generate more granular data on aapi communities the website that they created data.gov backslash aapi reveals some glaring disparities for example in the first year of college asian american and black students have the highest enrollment rates and remedial uh courses um education courses pacific islanders have among the highest unemployment rates of all racial and ethnic groups and asian american veterans are among the oldest and have the least education across other racial groups as well so as you can see disaggregating the data like this tells quite a different story about certain asian american subgroups not all fall into the category of the model minority so for you as policy makers college and university administrators faculty like myself access to this disaggregated data should help guide us when thinking about creating better policies and programs that not only align but also reflect the aapi community realities and their needs this bill will not only identify but target those students who are in most need of help but will also allow college and university stakeholders to work together to really increase the overall completion rates as i'm giving the opportunity to help these students succeed this is a common sense bill that in my mind will improve the lives and well-being of california's asian americans and pacific islanders and for this reason i respectfully urge for your i vote thank you thank you mr chair and um committee members my name is pakuhar and um i'm a third year first generation at sacramento state i am long american and the first person in my family to attend a four-year university and i will be the first person in my family to obtain a bachelor degree [Applause] with my economic disadvantages background there were no tools and allowed me to really seek for the needs that i really needed luckily my counselor in high school he noticed that i needed help and support so from this he was able to guide me and and was able to take me to um sacramento and sacramento state and that's why i was admitted to sacramento state i was very lucky but without the support of this individual i wouldn't have been here i am today and there are many individuals like myself and my other peers that are that are that they are also um feeling this way especially in high school because there is no guidance there is nowhere for them to really go and seek out for help and when i got admitted to sacramento state i was admitted to a learning community known as the full circle project the circle the full circle project strives to provide a student-centered approach to steadily increase the graduation rates among asian american pacific islanders and from this they go through academic support they influence the students who go to be um to participate in different organizations and leadership opportunities and only that they help us to have a community engagement as a whole this was the very first program i have witnessed that took the time to really excavate the aapi demographic data within sacramento state this is the only program that is asian american pacific islander at sacramento state when it first got admitted i believed that i was going to meet api individuals that i could not relate to for me being among among like the hmong heritage i noticed found out i found out within the sacramento state full-screen project that it was majority southeast asians and filipino from this i noticed that all these peers that i was with also has economic disadvantages as myself and this is the only program that really influenced the graduation retention rate among the asian american pacific islander at sac state from this also i noticed that we were put into the model minority myth and the model minority myth is to identifying saying that all asians are smart they are shy they are those that will be obedient to people but and from that they don't need any help but we really do need help we are categorized into a group and that doesn't define who we really are so from this program we are the living proof and there are over 300 api students in the full circle project we are collected as a whole and we shouldn't be collected as a whole because there are students that need help and from that especially in sacramento we are we are a diverse community and we have a lot of low-income students and from this this could this bill will really really help the students to enhance their education and have that person a person or individual to really allow them to continue on with higher education so with this i believe that if this if this bill is to be passed there will be more different programs such as the full circle project to be implemented into different universities and from this they could really allows asian american pacific islander students to strive for their goals so from this i really support the ab1726 bill thank you thank you other witnesses and support hi this is cat noo i'm here on behalf of southeast asia resource action center in support thank you good afternoon i'm jamie juarez i'm part of international brotherhood of electrical workers local 1245 i'm also the sacramento

a counselor and professor at san joaquin delta college i'm also president of our asian and pacific islander american staff association this semester we tried to launch a learning community for asian pacific american students similar to what they've done at sac state and we were able to get funds for it because they had leftover funds from last year but my experience was was when i tried to get funds for next year we couldn't do it because we didn't have enough data the only data that our college has is the data that lumps all asians into one category and since uh the the asians the uh the chinese japanese and uh indians are such a large group it overshadows the other smaller groups sub asian groups such as cambodian hmong and so what happens is when you try to compete on your campus for these special funds targeting disproportionate impact on these students you can't receive those funds so my my program didn't get funded because you're not able to stop you and i failed to say that that given that line back there behind you yeah if you would please all right just say your name the group you're with and that you're in support so i'm gonna okay for the next person take up

months old and i am a first generation college student and i had the opportunity as an undergrad to study abroad in china and they often asked you know what nationality i am and um i would tell them i'm american but in actuality they wanted to know what ethnicity i was and so when i told them i'm american they're like how can that be you have you know a petite stature black hair the face of someone from the east not the west and what they wanted to know was what ethnicity i was and what i appreciated most about that was that they asked me what ethnicity i was instead of assuming and so i am um and we came over here because we uh and you're in support i am in support yes so thank you for um asking instead of assuming so asking for disaggregated data thank you anyone else in support mary moyle with the chancellor's office for the community colleges and we're kind of a tweener now we've been in touch with the author's office we do have a couple of issues with the timeline and the um cost but we do plan to be working with with the author thank you witnesses in opposition hi i've introduced amway shenzhen i'm here to um about this for this bill and i posted it for two reasons first of all if you read the video carefully you can count how many times asian american appears in the bill and uh and just imagine if you see a bill that's like especially said for you what do you think and so and there's many other sub groups ethanol groups in california that was equal in similar diversified diverse and diverse and diversity and so why not including all the subgroups and so um second reason is um um by reading the bill and it's not clear what's the data are using i use it for i will be used for so it will be it one can not stop stop thinking um this will like cause more and more like a space will advance most space uh racial based uh public policies in california and which will be definitely um do harm to the equality in california and so so it and also what's the benefit of this bill for california that's not clear in the law too so why spend money and the energy to collect all those data and so for those reasons i just want to say this looks very dangerous and um be aware that with my course like racial attention or other social danger and so please help like vote against this law uh this bill thanks thank you any other witnesses in opposition comments or questions from members mr lowe thank you very much mr ponta as you know there is a lot of conversation related to the issue at hand too and in trying to address and acknowledge some concern perhaps you might be able to help provide some clarity as to the potential and the impact particularly of the legislation and the purpose of disaggregated data particularly as it helps in terms of the issues of equity inequality all across the board for higher education thank you mr low for your question colleagues we're here to solve problems in the state of california legislature and if you don't know what the problem is then you can't begin to craft a solution to that problem and right now we have data that is collected in categories that renders invisible outcomes for certain sub-populations this bill will reveal what is currently concealed and render visible what is currently invisible and then we can have a discussion about what steps take place next this bill does not prejudge what the solution is um and there are no solutions in this bill but we believe that data is not something to be feared but something to be embraced so you can get a sense of what the challenges are being faced by certain communities and then take steps from there and it could be a whole range of things it can provide information to the nonprofit world and foundations to do public awareness campaigns if a certain community is is facing public health challenges that are different than other communities and if behavior or wellness or prevention can be a part of the solution it could be additional resources to help certain communities with retention when you're in higher education or assistance to help graduate but we don't know until we know what the problem is and this bill is about really knowing what the problem is mrs baker thank you mr chairman i am i wonder if you know the the i just i have the governor's veto message from last time and it does raise a point in at the end that csu community colleges you see already provide many ways in which to self-identify there's many ways to do this already and um that it in fact there's 50 different ways depending on which form is provided and so in his view we saw this as unnecessary and that there are already ways to self-identify um can you just address that to make sure that we're we're focusing on i'm almost anticipating csu or uc or agencies coming back to us and saying you're going to need to fund more staff you're going to give us more funding for that because sometimes we get that in response to budget questions and as we've discussed here we'd really like to see the funding go to enrollment and support for the broader uc system i'm trying to anticipate what could come after this potentially gets out of committee can you address that sure you know i'm i'm of course aware of of the veto message from the governor and it's it has sparked a robust conversation between my office and the governors as well as organizations throughout the state who believe in this bill and the idea of disaggregated data with the governor's office so sometimes important ideas take time to get through the whole process and that's why we're here again this year we think there is is tremendous value to collecting data in categories that aren't currently being collected what this bill does is it takes a modest step to in the health and education arenas collect data that has already been collected and that this governor has signed and agreed should be collected in the department of industrial relations in the department of fair employment and housing he signed michael ing's assemblymember ing's bill i think it was in 2011. so this isn't something that's new to this governor um i think he had some concerns laid out in his veto message about the timing uh he thought that the proposed collection of the data which which was in last year's bill ab-176 was too far off in the future and we set that timeline to lower the burden as much as possible on the higher education segments and the departments to which the bill would have applied after hearing the governor's concern we've moved that timeline up to july 2017 and we just heard from the community colleges that that has raised some concern with them and we're very happy to work with them to get to a point that that makes sense will this have additional costs i think it will there were some costs associated with the bill last year of course this is a policy committee when we go to appropriations if we're fortunate enough to do so to move to the next step we'll address that issue and there are some ways to to keep the cost as modest as possible but when you have a policy change that provides something valuable to the community i don't think it's unreasonable to expect some costs to be associated with it thank you mr william well you might notice that uh the co-authors include uh most of the uh or at least half of the asian members of the legislature um and and there there is a reason um why i as api caucus chair uh support this their you know the the rubric of asian asia is a big continent okay people there there are very different um racial ethnic religious and economic factors that affect the health the educational background and um the outcomes of different uh asian subgroups um and uh to you know too often we equate people who um uh whose families and background stretched thousands of miles from one another and as uh you know in in this committee we particularly have been interested in the differences um and data that has helped us figure out about graduation rates right you know it feels like a lot of people who were kind of told to show up here because they're opposed to affirmative action regardless what your feeling is about affirmative action it is useful to know how long it takes for students to graduate and to segment that data in different factors both economic racial ethnic so that we can address some of the issues why are students taking six or seven years to complete a four-year education which by the way cost them good nineteen thousand dollars each additionally per year unless they're living at home which is another nine thousand dollars a year that's we need to know that and we didn't need to know what's different between different student populations to be able to address uh that and of course we need to know it in health so i you know i think uh figuring out what specific language needs are needed in certain regions or understanding what specific culturally competent services are needed for certain families all this are vital and relevant to our work as public servants and so if if no one's made the motion i'd like to move we we have a motion okay good mr chavis mr bonton thank you for bringing this forward and i agree having served you know three decades in in the pacific theater you know there's i always found it amusing how we in the united states just put them all in one little you know they're asian because if you look at the history you know between uh china and vietnam you know there's been historical uh issues with them for eons the same with japanese and so i agree with what we're trying to do here my concern is if we list this that maybe it could be a little more all incumbency uh sitting here listening to discussion you know that there's over 6 billion people in the world the united states has probably the most diverse country because people come here and i would dare say california is probably the most diverse of all of the the states in the union you know there's 196 countries in the world i just looked it up quick there's over 6 500 spoken languages in the world and there's literally thousands of cultures beyond that when you start thinking about language countries you know religions and how people interact and all those are part of the real challenging aspects that each of us as individuals encounter as we go to school so i i understand we're trying to go but i don't think it really speaks to the larger issue of what we're trying to do to ensure i think everybody in here would agree that all uh all individuals in the state of california are special and unique and we need to be respectful of their diversity ensure that they're successful in our educational institutions i don't care if you're ethiopian or you're guaminian i mean i want to make sure that we're a welcoming open state to them so is there any thought about expanding this much more than this conceptually i i think there could definitely be benefit from expansion we're trying to build on what's been done and build in a way that makes progress and doesn't prove too much um i think that this might be a multi-year effort if we're going to go in that direction and you know let's the legislature as a body over time is going to have to provide some input but at this point we selected public health or health and education so critical to all of our communities those two areas and we picked the sub the ethnic populations that have been in a previous bill that have have gotten approval by the legislature and so we wanted to build from there i think there's more to build after that and you know if it's the will of this body to to expand um further this year i'm open to that conversation i have no philosophical objection to that i have actually philosophical support for that but this was more of a strategic decision about getting a bill passed this year that can really benefit the populations that it that it involves and i understand that i understand this is part of the agenda of the i believe the the asian caucus i think it's your agenda to come forward you know sometimes when i look at the caucuses on the floor it's actually i feel they actually divide us more than bring us together my own favorite is latino caucus they won't even let me in it because i'm a republican so the you know actually divides us instead of brings us together so i think we need to have a more we got smiles everywhere i think we need to have a more inclusive view of what we're trying to do here so um but thank you for bringing this forward thank you mr chavez would you like to like to close mr bunta thank you for your questions and and for the the engaging dialogue we had an engaging dialogue last year as well and i appreciate it this is a really important issue so so thank you for being so thoughtful about it i think this is an area where we can really make progress as a state where this data can be invaluable um to help the the sub populations that it that it addresses so i respectfully ask you i vote thank you mr chair and members i want to thank the author for bringing it forward i want to thank the young lady from sacramento state as i have conversation with dr jane connolly president of long beach state university with a large hmong population they came in and met with me and explained to me the differences and why i think this bill is necessary so uh the recommendation is uh that we have a motion of emotion by miss weber second by mr levine uh the motion before us is due passed to the assembly health committee medina aye medina i baker bloom i chavez irwin irwin i jones sawyer jones sawyer i levine levine i linder blender i low low i olson olson not voting santiago santiago i weber webber i williams your motion passes i'll keep it open for members who are absent thank you mr chair members and staff thank you our next item item number two dr weber dog how are you doing good the real one huh um mr chair and members thank you again for um giving me the time this is abe 1653 be a bill dealing again with campus climate as many of you know i'm not going to rehash the history of campus climate in terms of how it came into existence we were all here at the time in terms of the formation of the committee and the numerous select committee hearings that we've had addressing this particular issue we've had a number of things to happen obviously in terms of even our state audit report and the recommendations from that committee that recommended that we have certain kinds of things and as we just heard from the past committee data becomes important in terms of determining what we do on our campuses and we'll be continuing with the campus climate committee our next hearing is in may at ucla to address some of the issues on that particular campus this uh in addition to the audit report recommended also that we require the state department of justice to provide guidance regarding compliance with requirements of the federal cleary uh disclosure of campus security policy and crimes uh statistics act as well as the violence against women reauthorization of 2013. the audit report indicated that none of the six california institutions reviewed completely complied with all of the federal reporting requirements ab1653 also addresses some of these recommendations in the audit report the solution to in ab63 is that we're once again requiring the state to uh states post-secondary institutions to generate report every by every biennial of the legislative session uh on new campus development as it impacts gender gender identity race ethnicity national origin religion sexual orientation and disability the 1650 ab 1653 will also define campus climate as a measure of an individual's experience within a learning environment specifically focusing on the current attitudes practices policies and behaviors on campus life that impact the success and retention of all members of a campus the report among other requirements would also include administrative efforts for campus climate including efforts to reduce food insecurity and student homelessness with some of the issues we dealt with this year in terms of those kinds of things and its impact upon the campus climate the report would be posted on the set on the on the segment's website rather than issuing a a a very lengthy written report in terms of that so that it's accessible it would be affordable at that time uh following this committee it is also our intent as we've talked with the committee here to reflect the recommendations moving forward in the committee's analysis and would change from the doj's guidance from the clery act and violence against women act to california student safety laws reflected in the ed code because the csu and the campuses are requesting that here to discuss this is angela haywood which is the legislative advocate for the california hawaii naacp hi um i'm going to keep my comments short because i believe as dr webber has answered everything but as you know there are about committee chair members there are about 2.5 million students enroll in institutions of higher learning and we believe that the this oversight measure is the legislature's opportunity to ensure that our children which is the next generation will be able to enjoy their experience of college life with while in doing so in a safe environment ab1653 will allow worried parents and students peace of mind knowing that they can look to the university's website to see what procedures the university has implemented to protect students from harassment intimidation and bullying as california continues to become more diverse ab 1653 strives to keep the public and the legislature informed about recent campus climate developments while providing additional oversight and accountability so for these reasons the california state conference of the naacp is in support thank you any other witnesses in support jill rice with the california federation of teachers and support greg to share with the ark and united cerebral palsy the coalition of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families friends and service writers and we support the bill alex graves at california state university we don't have a position yet however we appreciate the ongoing work of dr webber and her staff on this topic we've been in continued conversations with her staff we supported ab340 last year and i believe we'll get there again this year thank you thank you nadia el carrillo at the university of california we also don't have a formal position but have been in communication with the author staff and i appreciate the ability to share some of the questions and comments that our experts have so looking forward to continuing to work with the author on this thank you thank you any witnesses in opposition no witnesses in opposition do i have a motion yes i'd like to move to bill second all right the motion by mr jones sawyer seconded by mr williams any questions or comments seeing none we'll uh motion before us as do pass to assembly appropriations committee madam secretary we'd call the roll medina aye medina i baker bloom bloom i chavez irwin irwin i jones sawyer jones sawyer i levine levine i linder lender i low olson olsen i santiago weber i webber i williams williams eye 9-0 the motion passes the build passes uh we'll keep it open for add-ons thank you miss weber last item uh item six a b 1888 mr lower we'll give him two minutes maybe three mr lowe thank you very much mr chair and fellow colleagues for allowing me to present 1888. uh essentially uh we want to be a state that does not discriminate and as such there are a number of private institutions private educational institutions that currently do discriminate based on sexual orientation uh this proposal would suggest that if an institution receives cal grant funding for the students that they provide a statement that they do not discriminate and what's important is that the institutions if they are receiving public dollars they can send an affirmative statement related to the issues at hand wouldn't focus on the issues of equality and happy to answer additional questions and i have two individuals here speaking in support as well good afternoon mr chair and members joe michael for equality california we're proud to sponsor this bill and work with the assembly member on it because california law does not allow government entities or organizations that offer services to the public to refuse service to people based on a protected characteristic the state providing funding to academic institutions that seek to discriminate based on protected characteristics is not in line with california's public policy to support such unequal treatment would go against california's values and must be prevented we want to note that this bill conforms to existing law in government code section 11135 which prohibits discrimination in any state or local program including in the cal grant program it's also very important to note what the real effect of this kind of discrimination is institutionalized discrimination harms students and creates an unsafe atmosphere for both students and employees at academic institutions the discrimination that we're talking about here could include for example termination of employees or expulsion of students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity forbidding students from forming clubs or groups where these topics might be discussed or placing transgender students in separate housing apart from their peers the recent human rights campaign report on this issue and the analysis from this committee thank you for the analysis by the way um highlight the recent increased number of applications for title ix waivers nationwide here in california as many as six schools are seeking these waivers in part in response to the clarification from president obama's administration that they issued confirming the title ix coverage of discrimination based on gender identity and uh and non-conformity to sex stereotypes there's nothing in this bill that prevents schools from seeking waivers of title ix requirements or from exercising their religious beliefs they just can't also pursue a cal grant funding request at the same time as that waiver because that would go against existing california nondiscrimination law so that's really what this bill is seeking to get at all students deserve to be protected from discrimination in their educational environments california students deserve to be confident not only in the knowledge that they are protected from discrimination but also that academic institutions in this state cannot benefit from california state funds while also seeking to discriminate we respectfully urge the committee support thank you hi becca kramer from the aclu of california and we are also proud to support this bill we recognize that this bill brings state the spending of state money in line with the state's values is expressed in state law we would also like to point to add on to what joe has already said that in addition to schools being still being able to apply for a waiver under this bill students also are still eligible for cal grants under this bill and have a choice in which school to go to this this bill does not limit students in use of cal grants and does not limit schools that would like to receive cal grants it simply says you have a choice in what is more important following state anti-discrimination law or receiving this funding again this bill is about bringing state funding in line with current california state law and ensuring that the state is not funding institutions that actively are pursuing the ability to discriminate and for these reasons we support this bill and encourage your eye vote thank you other witnesses and support jill rice with the california federation of teachers and strong support hello my name is nolani sallings i'm a trustee in santa clara unified school district i also have two daughters one who is 20 and in college and one who's 17 on her way to college and i wholeheartedly support this bill nora lynn on behalf of the california faculty association in support i'd like to move the bill witnesses in opposition john daggett of the law firm hiroshima you want to come up to the uh uh i don't think i need to unless you'd like to sure there's plenty more good afternoon mr chair and members erica romero on behalf of the association of independent california colleges and universities we represent 78 independent nonprofit california universities our board met early this morning and had a very lengthy discussion around this piece of legislation our board wants to make it clear that we do not stand for discrimination however we must respectfully oppose this bill we seek to work with the author on language that gets to our mutual agreement around higher education and the role of higher education and we understand that this is an incredibly sensitive subject and our campuses don't stand for discrimination whether non-secular or faith-based institutions of higher education strive to be a safe environment where students can learn and grow as people they seek to do that within an educational framework that is informed by their mission and vision and in on occasion that would be a faith-based institution i understand that ab1888 came about because of the assembly members concerns about the number of title ix institutions we need to highlight that this bill goes far beyond that there is section a of the bill which refers to non-discrimination but there's not a description of what discrimination is in its broadest interpretation if left up to csac it could simply be that religious institutions either seek to forego their religious exemptions they seek to forego their mission as a faith-based institution or the state of california is going to penalize low-income students we've been told that students aren't impacted that they can choose a different institution important to remember that last year the csu denied admissions to 30 000 qualified students the uc doesn't reject anybody but it sends it to send students to campuses that they are overwhelmingly saying no to so we don't think that further denying access to low-income underrepresented students sends the correct message furthermore we think it's important to note that the cal grant program was started in 1955 to allow low-income students to select the institution that first best serves their academic needs and so we are denying students access to the institutions of their choice the law does say that you either can't apply for a title nine waiver which is a federal right granted to these institutions or we're going to penalize your students first i think there's a misconception that when a title ix waiver is sought that it is a broad tool allowed allowing discrimination title ix waivers are very very limited in what an institution can and cannot do furthermore they are subject to the u.s department of education investigating them if there is any allegations of discrimination under title ix for which they did not receive a very narrowly tailored exemption i think that as we move forward it is important that we work with the author's office we do understand that he is seeking against discrimination every one of our institutions would say that they can affirmatively say that they don't discriminate they operate within the understanding and the limitations of what is federally and state allowed exemptions thank you organization did you say you were with me association of independent california okay thank you i appreciate the opportunity to speak i didn't come planning to speak i don't have prepared remarks i just want to make a couple comments my name is john daggett i'm with the law firm of hiroshima daggett i represent or work with a number of institutions that would be affected by this bill i'm a cal grant recipient i was not eligible for csu or uc and frankly probably not most of the schools on the list of schools that aiccu represents thank you to the community college system i know there were some people here speaking on their behalf before success story graduated from ucla after ucr undergrad after transferring from the community college so i'm very thankful for everything that higher ed does in california mike my primary concern is that i feel that this is a bill that's going to have a lot of negative consequences not just on low-income students and minority students but i think just when you look at the the uh the effect that it's going to have on those students i think it far outweighs the risks that are trying to be avoided i can't speak for most of the schools on the aiccu list or other religious institutions of higher ed but i can speak for some that i know i've worked with closely and this is not a for the most part groups of schools who are seeking to discriminate on this basis most of them are attempting to struggle with something that's very difficult and they're dealing with biblical interpretations that uh there's a lot of evolution and work being done on this i can just tell you that there are efforts being made to accommodate and work with lgbt students to the maximal degree possible within these sincerely held beliefs that some of these institutions may have we've heard a lot here today about students who can't get into csu and uc schools this would i think really have an extremely negative impact in adding to that burden because you're going to add a lot of students who are not able to attend schools in california so i think that that needs to be kept in mind as well sorry it's not particularly articulate but those are my concerns thank you questions comments ms olsen thank you mr chair um a few questions i appreciate i believe the from aclu were articulating the fact that you are upholding a faith-based institution's constitutional right to exercise the principles of their faith whether or not we may agree or disagree with those principles and so you're trying to find a creative way to ensure that there isn't discrimination while at the same time protecting that constitutional right so i appreciate that my concern is i have a couple questions but my overriding concern is similar to what was just articulated is is the penalty being properly placed so the penalty is not on the institution per se the penalty is on the student who will no longer be able to receive a cal grant and i guess why i'm so concerned about that is number one as we just talked about earlier today we don't have enough slots in our csus and ucs in our public universities there simply are not enough slots to meet the needs of california students today we already have a shortage of university slots to meet the need of students who are fully eligible and not to mention those who may not be fully eligible that are going to private institutions instead so that's one of my concerns and second it would have a dramatic effect on students at many of these universities because at some of them one in the central valley for example 50 percent of their students are on a cal grand 50 percent and almost three-quarters of their students are first-generation college students and so my concern is again is the penalty properly placed or would something else be more appropriate and then my second question was do we as a state and i don't know the answer to this do we as a state have the jurisdiction and the ability to take away the federal right of an institution to seek a title ix exemption um thank you very much for the the concerns um the the first issue um to address the um concern about the cal grant for the student it's actually portable which is to say that it can follow the student and i just want to highlight this is one of the shortest bills i've i've ever seen i mean it's literally it's not even a full page when you combine the first and the front um and this is a voluntary program cal grant is a voluntary program simply put the institutions states that they do not discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity so again it's very clear that when we talk about the student it can still follow them to another institution yes but where would you propose that student go because what you're asking of the institution or what you're asking is either for the students to go elsewhere and there is no elsewhere because there's just not enough slots or for the institution to undermine the principles of its own faith which is not a great situation either way right sure so are we just telling students they don't get to go to college no what we're saying is that any institution that receives public funding within the state of california to adhere to the same civil rights that we are all afforded as clearly stated that the institution now shall not subject the student or employee of discrimination based including sex sexual orientation gender identity or gender expression so within the purview of the state of california if you are receiving public taxpayer dollars which is a voluntary program the institution must submit and just say that we do not discriminate i can completely understand that completely understand that my question is the penalty isn't on the institution the penalty is on the student and so where are those students to go particularly considering the fact that at some of these institutions it's 50 of the student body well my sense it would be that if there is over 50 percent who receive cal funding in the institutions that you've described that the institution would see that this is an unacceptable move and that they would need to implement such positive affirmation statements so even in cases where institutions have had no complaints of discrimination they would have to undermine the principles of their own faith or turn away fifty percent of the student body was involved not really what we're trying to achieve what we're trying to achieve is making sure that we don't have any discrimination and i respect the position that you're in but i think there's a difference in where we're at on okay as long as there's an understanding of the very real consequence of what this bill achieves intended or unintended it will be a very real consequence and i'm not sure that that's in the best interest of the vast majority of california students and then my second question was do we have the authority to take away a federal right to take the federal right um for the exemption it's it's a voluntary if the private institution would like to seek a waiver title ix that's up that's up to them so if we're not we're not forcing them by requesting a waiver again there are many options moving forward on for the example of the choice whether or not they seek the wave or not is up to them um many do not seek the waiver many of the institutions of the association do not uh seek waivers so we're not forcing anyone to do anything of that nature mr levine if i could help address some of those would that be all right yeah go ahead great um so i i think one of the important points to highlight here is this this is frankly a subsidy to a school a cal grant is a source of state subsidy that also not to a school but it subsidizes the school to continue educating these students right so it is a subsidy to the school as well and really this is an issue of separation of church and state frankly um if if a school is interested in pursuing its uh its rights as a religious institution then there's nothing to stop that school from doing that they just can't also simultaneously benefit from california dollars in order to frankly advance that discrimination and just to be clear as the analysis points out we're talking about four schools in california that actually would fall under this bill as it's currently drafted and currently have both existing title nine waivers and are participating in the cal grant program which is frankly a rather small number and students would be able to choose from any number of other private institutions in addition to the existing state systems it's not as if the the option is just these four schools or csu and uc schools there are a number of other options available in california besides just those okay to be clear and then we'll move on but to be clear i understand what you're trying to achieve and i'm not even suggesting i agree or disagree with that i understand what you're trying to achieve what i'm asking is if we've been really thoughtful about where the penalty is being placed and an understanding and a recognition that the consequence of this policy will be putting thousands of students displacing thousands of students from their schools and that's just the point i wanted to make clear mr levine yeah thank you mr chair mr michael just made my point for me so thank you it's like you read my mind this is uh you know these cal grants essentially become a giant state subsidy of these private institutions and and so what we need to do is make sure that our state's values are are represented and that our students are able to go to institutions that support the values that they want to make sure that they're surrounded by and perhaps these institutions will change or they will wane while new institutions are able to take their place but it is while it's directed through a student this is how if we look at a portion of any of these schools budgets what proportion of that budget is funded through the cal grant and you know when they start creating their financial aid plans for students they are looking at the public subsidy that students are going to bring to those institutions that's how these institutions finance themselves and uh in a large part of how they finance themselves so i think this legislation is completely appropriate and mr michael thank you for raising that point mr williams well i'm going to support the bill because i think that um when in in doubt we should always err on the side of inclusion but i i and i appreciate mr levine's point but i i i would just ask the author and the sponsor not to be so in my view flippant about the question at hand you maintain that you want to protect the constitutionally established right of an of a religious institution to practice their religion which includes discrimination right that's a long-term uh established constitutional right because you don't we don't force religious institutions to um you know say hire people that are outside of their faith or pre or or practice things contrary now i always have argued and i'll give you a personal anecdote i've served on the board of a religious non-profit they one member said let's establish a discrimination policy and i said well against who and they said well you know against lgbt individuals and i said well if we establish that policy i would also ask that you establish that against fornicators so that i can't serve on your board anymore because at the time i was living with you know my girlfriend and i felt like that sent the right signal and they dropped that immediately right um so we should um i think fight for inclusion within religious institutions and i do but i also don't believe that we should be uh telling religious institutions contrary to their rights i think the question is here that you're that this is bringing up and i think it's good that you're bringing up is are these institutions religious institutions or are they academic institutions or are they both when we have very different rules for academic institutions where we expect strong uh uh measures requiring inclusion and to any discrimination and then we also have religious institutions that have established constitutional rights i just think it's a little like tougher than than this has made it seem at first blush um but i also think that we are talking about um the most religious institutions have not asked for a title ix waiver which i think is what is so wonderful about this state and uh about the place is that they have not asked for a title ix waiver for this so you know after a little bit of wrangling i i just think that at this point we should default on inclusion default on backing up our principles against discrimination but but i do think this is still something to wrestle with is what are these what are these institutions which are they or are they both and if they're both are there functions um where for instance you know i would say as as academic institutions we could never permit discrimination against students right that to me is a non-brain no-brainer um uh but are there functions of those institutions that are religious in nature and should be protected constitutionally as religious institutions are protected respond briefly you know if if i might i i had a question for mr michael and also for your group and and my question is uh and and following up mr williams on on what basis do the four institutions i think that are listed uh in california uh ask and seek for and and get the waivers from uh title ix um as is noted in the analysis that was in response um to the the recent decisions that indicate that title ix includes gender identity and offers protections on that basis and i i believe that the analysis states specifically that all of these waivers were sought after that and in response to that decision so it's really about the um the the fact that title ix now officially is interpreted to include gender identity and that that has um caused some concern for these institutions um in terms of how they would address transgender students so you're saying that it's the inclusion of transgender and lgbt students it's causing and and that that is uh really highlighted in the report by human rights campaign on the more national level and the responses that are going on in other states which granted are much more extensive um but california is sort of a microcosm of of what's going on nationally mr lowe yes mr chair um the impetus particularly was the two letters that received one was from biola university here in california in which they asked for the waiver in employment and in student life we regard sex at birth as the identification of the given biological sex of each member constituency we will not accept as valid alterations of one sex at birth based on experimental variation or medical intervention um this is an agreed this is egregious by nature and this was biola and in fresno certain sexual behaviors are prohibited they are not limited to fornication adultery same-sex romantic relationships and or gender identity and it's not just narrow they specify here it's an admission preference and emission recruitment education programs housing comparative facilities access to classes and schools access to vocational education counseling financial assistance employment marital and parental athletics related to employment these this is the impetus for the the bill at hand because it's not just well we want to be respectful of religion this is a problem this is a pervasive problem and we see letters as such so this is why we are addressing this issue at hand the second one was uh yes this was um from um let's see the first one was from biola and the second one from fresno pacific university i i just say that the the latter case really kind of illustrates the need for the bill that's pretty egregious that's students and that's at all levels both the functions that are clearly academic um and the functions that are outside the scope a chance to respond as well so the waivers if you read the letter of response from the u.s department of education specifies that it is restricted to certain items and as noted in the analysis most of it is housing so providing student housing consistent with the faith in some cases requesting that students who are transgender be placed in a separate dorm room instead of a shared location but each varies by institution and again the u.s department of education responds with the waiver that is very very limited into what they are allowed to do what what is it that they are allowed to do so they are allowed to in most cases it is housing facilities and athletics so determining that transgender students cannot participate for instance in an athletic team with their self-identified gender in dorm room situations that they can be placed um if it's a single sex storm they're requesting some kind some kind of accommodation so that they are um in a separate dorm um so it it again facility apart from uh well a single dorm room and if it's a single sex dorm yes trying to find a different accommodation separate but equal and again part of the concern aside from the title ix is how section a of the bill is interpreted which says they'll certify that they don't discriminate which there isn't actually in that code what that looks like so for instance does it mean on an institution's campus if they have a chapel or church and that church won't perform a same-sex marriage of two students um does that mean it's discriminatory in which case once again you have essentially told every faith-based institution that they either have to choose between their faith or their low-income cal grand students will be penalized by no longer receiving a cal rate they'd receive anywhere else so it's broader than just the title ix issue i'm sorry may i make a comment briefly or if someone else is in line i can wait mr linder thank you mr chair um i want to offer what i think is a is a very real example um that i'd like to share just in my my personal scenario um grew up in a family where you know our motto was love everybody you know i've taught that to my kids my boys you know and it doesn't matter gay straight transsexual black white mexican hispanic we love everybody that's kind of what we do in our house um now my daughter is very much like that same type of mentality i think you'd all really love her to death she's just a very very non-prejudicial person i think that she's a prime example of of that uh that that just love everybody vibe now she it was her dream to go to cal baptist and she got there on a cal grant scholarship or cal grant with help she's one of the recipients and it's uh it's concerning to me that you know and if this bill does does become law then i don't know that that and by the way she wanted to go to the school because it's a great school um you know she's uh she's uh her faith is important to her and again very non-discriminatory but um this was her dream school it's a good school and what this does if this becomes law is this doesn't necessarily penalize the school it penalizes me and it penalizes my daughter because it takes that option that choice away from us she wouldn't be able to she would have been able to go to a school without this kel grant so that's why um if i'm going to be opposing the bill because this is a personal uh situation i i don't want the uh the the choice taken away for uh for somebody who wishes to go to the school and and just has that uh completely taken away so appreciate what you're trying to do but uh i will be opposing thank you sir i just wanted to comment i really appreciated mr williams uh statement about airing on the side of inclusion and it seems to me very clear that if you want to err on the side of inclusion it would necessitate a vote against this on the micro level this is a sledgehammer on a finishing nail i think based on my experience working with a number of institutions they will end up regretfully making the choice that they don't they can't compromise sincerely held religious beliefs and that will lead to lgbt students not having the ability themselves to utilize cal grants i can tell you a number of the institutions i've worked with are admitting happily lgbt students and attempting to work with them as best they can and i think this would actually have the result of excluding those students they wanted the ability to use the cal grants at those schools and frankly the lgbt groups on a number of these campuses have really been a force for good in helping to uh work through some of these issues and battle on this and not battle but to work together really to try and go something that's typically a battle i mean we see it's a battle in the public sphere and at the schools i'm seeing these groups working together trying to find ways to have students who are lgbt and and coordinate with them to ensure they can attend these institutions in as an inclusive way as possible and it seems to me that this would have the opposite effect in the end lgbt students would not have the cal grants and there would be a number of students who may not even attend those institutions and now they won't have any lgbt students there mr linder and i share cal baptist university we've said for the three years that i'm not sure whose district it's in if it's half in yours and half in mine but we both claim it um so i i am not sure why and i've had conversation with god baptist university but i'm not sure why with this bill an institution faith-based institution um so it's kind of a question to you why would this bill hinder or how would it force an institution like al baptist to do anything different from what it's doing now because it's a faith-based institution and in my conversation with cal baptist they said that they have not asked for a waiver don't plan on asking for a waiver uh and that they have admitted you know have lbgt students as students admitted and graduate why would the passage of this bill force or or push an institution like cal baptist to do anything different from what it's been doing thank you no i can't comment for cal baptist specifically because i don't have any experience with them but i can tell you with the institutions that i do have some experience with the issue is not that they're discriminating now but that you can see there's been a very significant change in both uh supreme court decisions legislative action public opinion and these institutions are not in a position where many of them who are not discriminating now are not in a position where they can say sign on a document say we do not discriminate on these bases because the perfect example given be my by my i can't say colleague i didn't know or even see her until now but the comment about the church many of these institutions have churches they're on the campus the people who work in those churches are employed by the campus and they do not perform same-sex wedding ceremonies in those churches and they couldn't certify that they don't discriminate because in fact if you're including situations like that they do and so they have to make that decision proactively to say well we don't want to discriminate against lgbt students we cannot sign on a line saying we will not discriminate because we'd be forced to turn away a very fundamental first amendment right that we've enjoyed since the beginning of this country thank you any other questions or comments if not um mr lowe you want to close yes thank you very much uh members of the i very much appreciate the robust dialogue and i just want to bring it back just to the bill the bill at hand is just two lines do you support institutions not subjecting students or employees to discrimination on the basis of sex sexual orientation gender identity or gender expression that is the bill i respectfully ask foreign a motion by mr levine second by mr john sawyer madam secretary if you would call the role medina aye medina

3HmXL2jitmQ,CA,08-11-2016,"good morning everyone I like to bring this portion of our Appropriations Committee to order we're going to start as a subcommittee so we can continue our business we have 14 bills to hear for regular order today only two of which are eligible for due pass motion the remaining bills are suspense items that we'll be addressing very soon I'd like to remind the audience and members again that the testimony should be limited to the fiscal aspects of the bill I think we have hormone so sergeant's would you please call the absent committee members and the following members are presenting bills so that we can get started and I think we have assembler Blum ok mr. Blum before we please come forward before we begin let's establish our quorum secretary please Lara here Bates Bates here Belle Hill McGuire McGuire here Mendoza Mendoza here Nielsen how are you Thank You mr. Blum you do have one item with us there's a to pass recommendation this is ad 1453 welcome thank you thank you mr. chair and members I'm very pleased to be here to present a B 1453 with this bill and recent announcements at seaworld a two-year fight to end captive breeding of orcas in California has come to an end this is a historic and monumental change in corporate policy that we will now enshrine in California law so that no company will be able to collect orcas for breeding or keeping in captivity in the state of California a B 1453 ends captive breeding of orcas in California and allows the current captive orcas to live out their lives at SeaWorld well it doesn't do everything that my previous bill a B 21:40 tried accomplished it is indeed a very very significant step forward and while I wholeheartedly and a support and applaud SeaWorld's recent announcement to end captive breeding ad 1453 is still needed in the case of a leadership change or a change in their business model and to prevent any other company from repeating past mistakes by deciding to engage in this anachronistic practice with this bill the people of California and animal welfare advocates who have been at the forefront and calling for this change will be given the assurance they need and deserve and I look forward to moving forward with SeaWorld at my side there is no opposition to this bill and there's minor and absorbable cost to the state I ask for your aye vote Thank You witnesses in support very briefly Pete Montgomery on behalf of SeaWorld as some member glu mentioned we announced an end to our captive reading program on effective March 17th since that time we worked very closely with Sol member blooms office and the Humane Society this is important legislation for stability and predictability and we think Assemblymember bloom and the sponsors for their existence thank you morning mr. chair members of the committee jennifer fearing here today on behalf of the animal welfare Institute the Humane Society of the United States defenders of wildlife in the San Francisco SPCA strongly urge your support of this important legislation thank you thank you witnesses in opposition please come forward finance Jacqueline Wong Hernandez with the Department of Finance I don't have a file on this bill comments or questions from committee seeing that numbers is this to enjoy a do pass there's a motion by Senator Hill again this is due pass to the Senate floor mr. bloom would you like to close I respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you secretary please call the roll Laura all right Laura aye Bates Bates aye Belle Hill Hill I'm Maguire Maguire aye Mendoza Mendoza aye Nielsen Nielsen aye 0 we'll keep the roll up until our absent member terence from I think I see mr. Chiu - you have two items or webbing presentation on AV 723 I would like to present on 27 97 is that correct that is absolutely correct perfect go ahead Thank You mr. chairman sinners first of all I do know it's a little unorthodox to be presenting on the day of suspense and I appreciate the opportunity to present this bill is an important district bill which was unanimous through five Assembly and Senate committees in the assembly floor earlier today we received some committee analysis that had raised some questions that we had not had a chance to address I want to just take a moment and first thank the committee staff for their hard work we certainly appreciate how much work you have but we wanted to be able to answer any concerns that you may have this district bill is essential to the creation of a new important San Francisco neighborhood called Mission Rock the neighborhood is being developed after a competitive process by the San Francisco Giants to plan a new mixed-use neighborhood south of 18t Park at the location of a currently existing parking lot it's a transit-oriented mixed-use development neighborhood that will be creating open space commercial space and residential apartments including thousands of affordable housing units for low-income residents 40% affordability it was approved overwhelmingly by the voters of San Francisco which thinks some of you may know is quite rare the issue that is dressed in this bill has to do with the fact in 2007 the port of our city of San Francisco worked with the California State Lands Commission to pass SB 815 that permitted the productive reuse of ports e-wallets unnecessary for so-called public trust purposes except to produce revenue to support the trust while this bill set the stage for development in 2007 we didn't know much about the site's infrastructure and financing needs this bill will allow the port to use a variety of financing tools to bring about this critical neighborhood with that like to turn it over to our witness Thank You witnesses in support mr. chair members Joshua Shaw with Xiaoyu Durant we for the City and County of San Francisco's mayor Edwin Lee and our port of San Francisco also won't appreciate your patience today we're talking about as you heard turning a dilapidated set of peers that stick out into our water covered by asphalt used only as a parking lot today into a wonderful community asset the 2007 law that the author mentioned does allow us to develop like this the special sauce in this bill would tweak that lot to make sure that we can advance non-trust revenues with our developers so that we can kick-start that infrastructure which ultimately on the public infrastructure side the city and county will take over without those non-trust revenues being used to kick-start this project we cannot ultimately build the project which will be developed and returned value to us such that we can add to the public trust without this again we cannot increase the value of the public trust by orders of magnitude and there is a concern raised in the analysis about these leases the 2007 law capped the lease on any particular development in 75 years we've asked you to give us permission to extend that lease on a parcel by parcel basis because since the 2007 law our developer our plan has shown that we must develop this over time so as each new parcel gets built we ask for an extension of the lease but only 75 years for each of those leases in the meantime those parcels would be used for the exact purposes of the 2007 law so the state is not losing anything by giving us that time to do the development and we'll conclude by noting the State Lands Commission and our regional partner of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission have worked with us hand-in-hand to formulate the amendments to that's 2007 law they are very comfortable that the trust which is their job to protect will actually benefit from this approach we urge your aye vote thank you Thank You additional witnesses in support when this is in opposition finance we're neutral on this bill the State Lands Commission is indicated that they don't anticipate any state costs from the bill thank you comments or questions from committee seeing none mr. Chiu I wanted to just ask you really quick why do we need a lease at least term of 75 years couldn't we do this can we get enough returned if we were to have a shorter lease maybe like 50 years like to turn over to the city mr. chair through the author the financing plan that's been put in place after the procurement that the author described which involved public participation shows us that you get the right return on equity from for the developer they need that amount of time when I mentioned we're phasing in the buildings over time so an initial 75 year cap would hamper for instance the last set of buildings we put in the if the developer was looking at only having say 30 years left under that otherwise 2007 75 year cap they're not going to be able to pencil out that particular building so it's a basket of individual developments that each need those 75 years to get back what they need from the marketplace we can repay them they can make their equity and the trust will generate revenue from this approach and you can't do that within the 50 year we have explored that on the marketplace and that's the signal back that we have received for this particular set of parks residential apartment building and commercial and residential developments I'll mention over the past 10 years there have been numerous projects proposed along the waterfront that frankly have not been able to move forward because of the needs of the community that have layered on layered on things two projects such that those projects can't pencil out so that is why again the timeframe on this is a little bit longer than usual but again it's capped at 75 years I think the scrutiny on our part is I mean these are public lands you know this is we got to be very careful and you know for us is you know not indicating just a question for us is it appropriate to keep these trust lands out of the public trust for potentially a time over what like a hundred years from now so you know I guess that's the question we were asking ourselves mr. chair on that we would clarify again if some of the buildings don't even start we don't even begin construction for maybe ten years from now if you approve this bill and the governor signed it we would start right away but some of the parcels will not begin to be developed until ten years from now in the meantime they are consistent with current law as envisioned the trust and this 2007 law that Senator magnet put in place that prophet put some extra requirements on us so once we begin and we get that built then that new 75 year does trigger but that's not taking anything out of trust for a hundred years it's that seventy five year lease that is going to be finite and defined for each particular building okay and again I certainly I certainly understand where you're coming from if it were up to me we'd have shorter time periods we've just had so many projects that have been proposed that just simply have fought over time because they don't pencil out we have many dilapidated piers that are literally falling into the sea because we haven't been able to find developers that have been able to meet the community needs in this case we're talking about transit oriented commercial growth 40% affordability which is critical in our city as you know open space which is critical and the densest neighborhoods on the west coast so this project works but it only works at that time like thank you Thank You members any additional questions or comments from committee seeing none mr. Chiu would you like to close again I respect Lee asks as you moved to the process that if there are any issues happy to continue working with committee staff but would very much hope that the committee could support moving this up thank you without objection we move this item to the suspense file thank you thank you very much Chavez mr. Chavez has three items yeah we are beginning one movie again you have three items let's begin with a B 1706 thank you very much chair subject no 6 deals with Stolen Valor Act would update the provision to California's Troughton Valor Act to conform with federal Stolen Valor Act it's a very clean up move it's for the purpose of obtaining money property and receiving tangible benefits of any elected officials misrepresented themselves and ask for your support has ready ask for any questions Thank You witnesses in support when this is in opposition finance no file comments or questions from committee this is a candidate for suspense the three suspense items members mr. Chavez has got you close I just ask for your support thank you without objection we move this item to the suspense file moving on to AV 1875 I'm sorry chair did you move that bill under suspense yes it's a cat it's a cannon for suspense pardon what moving into suspense okay baby let's go to your next item may be 1875 its noted on the agenda as candidate for suspense oh you have the agenda why don't we continue with 1875 mr. Chavez was it the candidate for suspense earlier bill I thought it wasn't we had six bills per for your committee or three of them were put on suspense just on Friday and then we had these other three bills that were supposed to go forward but myself indicates me that we did discuss to you that we did inform yourself that your bills are counters for suspense there were a total six you've moved three to suspense and these are the other three last week we had six bills on Friday afternoon you moved three of the bills of suspense and those bills are give me the numbers I know them I know the bill numbers that we move for suspense last week now you're moving the other remaining three events yes so 1875 1875 deals with CalSTRS and find benefit program members and cash balances allows members who have a children with special needs to have a special trust this is extremely important for families who have children who have special needs and ask for your support thank you thank you mr. Travis witnesses in support when this is in opposition finance Department of Finance is neutral on this bill which doesn't have a direct fiscal impact of the budget but we do know to concern that the bill doesn't provide CalSTRS with the necessary means to prevent improper payments to designated beneficiary trusts specifically it requires people to self certify that the trust meet the criteria of a special needs trust instead of actually us affirming that comments or questions from committee - Chavez relates close as for your support thank you without objection we move this item to suspense file as well a B 1936 mr. Chavez cool as this bill actually deals with military dependents was brought to me by a military family a child who attended high school in California we was accepted to college and then their father received orders and they read to another state before they were able to enroll in college so for that 3060 days at summer time with her move in they said they were no longer labeled to his be seen as a California resident because her family just moved even though the student had gone to California high school was accepted to a California College the parents were living in California but was given orders to leave over the summer so this bill allows them to be seen as a California resident for the student and I ask for your support and have Connie and associates to speak to the support of it thank you witnesses in support Dana Nicol with pecan eighteen associates representing the California state commanders Veterans Council coalition of 15 veterans groups representing over 1 million California veterans in support you additional witnesses in support when this is in opposition finance why neutral on this bill as well but we do note a concern that it could be confusing the language about folks being eligible from the time they're admitted when it regards when it's regard to a community college student because it's a little unclear when a community community college student is I admitted thank you comments or questions from committee there is a motion to move the bill we are thank you our vice chairwoman has moved a motion to move the bill I'm going to entertain a substitute motion to move this bill to the suspense file so our motion so so the motion that is Thank You senator Hill this mr.

a B 723 witnesses in support well this is in opposition finance it was the Department of Housing and Community Development in Cal HF a do not know any costs associated with implementing the bill thank you without objection we move this item to the suspense file moving on to a be 2153 by a summer Garcia witnesses in support witnesses in opposition finance the Board of Equalization estimates that they would have administrative costs of approximately 1.2 million to 1.6 million annually based on similar workload from other new fees and assessments DTSC did not have a cost estimate but has stated that the workload could be significant the Board of Equalization does also estimate that fee revenue could generate approximately 13 239 million dollars annually depending on how manufacturer assessments would be implemented and how much manufacturers would pay as voluntary fees it's unclear to us how likely it would be for someone to pay a voluntary fee so our our revenue estimate is a little lower which is 13 million to 26 million annually thank you without objection we move this item to the suspense file moving on to a B 2170 by assembly Fraser when this isn't support please come forward chairman and members Andrew ant we're here today on behalf of the Port of Los Angeles the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Pacific merchant shipping Association in support thank you when this is in opposition finance the Department of Finance is opposed to this bill because it's premature and could potentially limit the ability of Caltrans to direct new federal funds to important highway repair projects in the state highway operations and protection program thank you comments or questions from committee seeing and hearing none without objection this item to suspense file moving on to a be 20 to 80 20 to 82 by December Calderon when this isn't support when it says in opposition finance mr. chair members of the committee Jennifer speck on behalf of the California Association of Realtors we support the goal of the bill however we believe that the Bureau of real estate is not the appropriate source to run this task force with of those other appropriate individuals or individual agencies that will better be able to facilitate the task force we are also concerned as the Department of our Bureau of real estate is a special fund agency and

GT-dyIAYyiI,CA,03-07-2016,"Oh approximately 10 minutes 12 minutes to 3:00 in the afternoon why don't we go ahead and get on a quorum established call the members please Hernandez Hernandez here Morel Anderson Belle Belle here Hall Leno Leno here McGuire Mitchell Mitchell here Monning Morlock more luck here Nielsen pan bulk wok here quorum has been established we have four items today it looks like we're gonna start off with number one ABS secondary extraordinary session number seven aye mr. somebody members stone smoking in the workplace good afternoon Assemblymember welcome and please present so that closes loopholes in our smoking in the workplace laws in 1994 California led this nation with really groundbreaking laws that prevented secondhand smoke exposure by not allowing smoking in various workplaces since that time however because of a lot of exceptions in that law we have fallen way behind many states this bill closes a lot of those loopholes and would again put California better on par not make us a hundred percent smoke-free but would move us in that right direction and I asked for your aye vote thank you very much any like to anyone like to speak in support of the measure please state your name mr. chair and members kelly amped on behalf of the american heart American Stroke Association proud to co-sponsor this bill there is overwhelming scientific scientific evidence that secondhand smoke is a direct cause of heart disease the number one killer of both men and women in California the US Surgeon General's report in 2006 found that brief exposure to secondhand smoke can have an immediate adverse effect on the cardiovascular system as some members own alluded to one in seven workers report being exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace low-income workers young adults and Latinos are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at work exposure to secondhand smoke should not be a condition of employment and therefore we ask for your support of this bill please proceed mr. chairman senators Terry Brennan on behalf of Service Employees International Union proud members of the save lives coalition in California this is a simple bill closing some of the loopholes and the current requirements for smoke-free workplaces we have a lot of workers who for whom going to work every day involves many dangers but dying from secondhand smoke shouldn't be a condition of employment for anyone unfortunately this bill just takes us from about 48 percent smoke-free workplaces to somewhere near 60% we'd like to be a hundred but this is a great step forward we urge your support Thank You anyone else in support please come up and say it your name Tama with Health Access California in strong support Jody Hicks representing the California Academy of Family Physicians and the California Medical Association and support Michelle Gibbons representing the county health executives Association representing local health departments throughout California and strong support autumn Ogden on behalf of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also in strong support thank you any opposition to the measure let's go ahead and reestablish the quorum we were as short by two we can open the curl we call the absent members Morrell Anderson Hall McGuire McGuire here Monning yes Monning here Nielson Nielsen here pan pan here thank you is there any questions comments so Senator Leno yes Thank You mr. chair either for the author or possibly for mr. Brennan the remaining 40 of our workforce that will still be at risk do you know where they would mostly be represented well for example we have exempted places that sell tobacco so tobacco shops and other places private clubs things who would still may be able to allow smoking on premises but for bars and taverns hotels conference centers places like that where there there is much more public access they would be no longer exempted and under this bill there must be a large chunk because I can't imagine the smoke shops and folks represented anywhere near know I did my recollection was it was not quite that large true Brennan no no okay we'll find out thank you yeah we can get that information to you but my recollection was it wasn't quite that that many but just to clarify that statistic was a national number so that included other states and their smoke-free laws so this bill closes a little loopholes that it closes would bring the nation from forty eight percent to sixty nation in a nationwide for this for the state I don't have that specific number we get pretty we get pretty close the the exemptions you listed are still where you know I don't think that it's in the scheme of employ that's not will be relatively small it's not yeah it's not forty percent okay thank you Morlock Thank You mr. chair Assemblyman stone I just curious it says that an owner operated business even if it has no employees or no independent contractors just one person all by themselves they can't smoke that's correct can you still smoke in your home as you can so if your businesses in your home or is there an exclusion for that no and if you're if you are allowing people to come into your home if that's the place of your business then there is no exclusion for that so then if you're working on your own in your home that home business and no contact with the public then you can smoke I would presume so thank you any other questions comments seeing no questions or comments from any of the members would you like to close I ask for your aye vote and we have a motion by Senator Wolk chair is recommending a support this is due pass to appropriations can we call the absent can we call the members please motion has been by senator Wolk aye Hernandez aye Hernandez aye Morrell Anderson Anderson no Bell Bell aye Hall Hall aye Leno Leno aye McGuire McGuire aye Mitchell

[Music] item number 289 Thurmond tobacco use programs good afternoon and please proceed good afternoon and thank you mr. chair and members I'm here to present a b-29 it's a bill that will require that all of our campuses in the California state education system remain tobacco-free and that includes electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as our laws currently stand there are probably still 1,200 school districts that are not considered tobacco free that do not maintain signage just say tobacco cannot be anywhere on the campus including in vehicles and buildings throughout the campus this law would clarify that it is intended for all of our education agencies to promote tobacco-free policies and would also clarify the availability of funding for all of our school districts to be able to do that this bill has passed the assembly just last week and we would ask respectfully for the support of this committee today thank you is anyone like to speak in support of the measure wouldn't be freitas with the American Lung Association and California here in strong support it has been proven that schools that consistently enforce their tobacco-free policies have much lower smoking rates than schools that don't have policies like this and for these reasons we strongly support this bill and ask your aye vote Thank You anyone else in support Kali Hampton behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association support autumn Ogden on behalf of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also in strong support Christina Romero on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and strong support Michelle Gibbons with the county health executives Association representing local health departments throughout our state and support Arunima law representing next-gen climate action in support Jody Hicks with the California Academy of Family Physicians and also the California Medical Association in support Michelle Cabrera with SEIU California in support anyone like to make any comments or questions from any of the members see no questions or comments uh as Center Leno Thank You Assemblyman for authoring the bill and also specifically for including these cigarettes I'm sure your office not unlike mine have have heard from so many teachers parents others who say that they're just stunned how prevalent the smoking of e-cigarettes is in classrooms and that teachers often feel they have no legal right to stop their students from using these devices so it's very important that we make sure that this next generation is not as likely to become addicted to nicotine as they would otherwise so good work thank you sir move the bill we have a motion by Senator Leno would you like to close Thank You mr. chair Thank You senator Leno you know we we talked about this bill and clearly the one thing that we can do is prevent the kind of deaths that come from the use of tobacco and it's clear that when young people start smoking and that becomes the way they're introduced becoming a lifetime smokers and there's not a lot that we can control but we can control and prevent our kids from being exposed to these products that could shorten their lives and for those reasons I want to thank this committee and I urge your aye vote thank you thank you Cheers recommending support this is at number two do pass to appropriations a be nine special session number two call the members please Hernandez Hernandez aye Morrell Anderson Anderson no though Bell aye Hall Hall aye Leno aye Leno aye McGuire McGuire aye Mitchell Mitchell aye Monning Monning aye more Locke more like no Nielson Nielsen no pan pan I woke Wolk aye the count is nine to three that bill is out thank you item number three second extraordinary session a b10 bloom local taxes authorization cigarettes and tobacco products afternoon Assemblymember good afternoon Thank You mr. chair and members and thank you for giving me the opportunity to present ABX 210 which is a bill that allows counties to place local tobacco tobacco tax measures on the local ballot for a public vote California has one of the lowest tobacco taxes in the country we ranked 35th with an 87 cent tax per pack compared to the national average of a dollar 60 these rates have not been raised in California in over 15 years and yet smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States at least 30 percent of cancer deaths and 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking nationally 1 out of every 5 deaths is attributable to smoking in California 40,000 people lose their lives to tobacco related illness each year and tens of thousands of Californians struggle every day because of tobacco related illness of course treatment for these ailments as we all know is often expensive and medical spends 3.5 billion dollars in taxpayer dollars paying for tobacco related illnesses our goal is to reduce smoking and disease and we know that tobacco taxes work for every 10% increase in the pack of in the price of a pack of cigarettes there is a 4% reduction in overall cigarette consumption and a 6.5 percent reduction in youth consumption and this is only one of the reasons that why this bill is so important young people the Surgeon General projects that without a major reversal and trends 5.6 million youth aged 0 to 17 that are living today will die prematurely from tobacco use that's 5.6 million young people who will suffer premature preventable deaths today it is estimated that 16% of high school students are addicted not just smoking but addicted to cigarettes and one in four used some form of tobacco though there's widespread education on the dangers of tobacco availability and deceptive marketing continues to lure our youth to try these dangerous products tobacco kills more people than alcohol aids car accidents illegal drugs murders and suicides combined so members I ask you today to support this measure and take an important step towards fighting tobacco addiction and tobacco related illness ABX 210 will allow California counties to join the over 600 local jurisdictions nationwide that have their own cigarette tax or fees these jurisdictions bring in more than four hundred and thirty million dollars in annual revenue and work effectively to reduce smoking rates especially amongst young people and they decrease smoking caused death disease and of course the cost to go along with that increasing the cost of cigarettes is one of the most powerful and direct ways to reduce smoking studies have shown that youth and low-income adults are especially likely to quit or reduce smoking when prices increase our locals are well-equipped to know how to fight tobacco addiction this bill allows the Board of Supervisors of a county to propose such measures to their constituents it's a sensible measure that will help counties reduce tobacco use and save lives and I respectfully ask for your aye vote we have here today to add testimony Tim Gibbs with the American Cancer Society thank you and welcome thank you Tim Gibbs the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we support this legislation because we think local communities should be given a choice when it comes to protecting their citizens from the deadly effects of tobacco use as Assemblymember Liv mentioned there's more than 600 jurisdictions across the country that levy their own tobacco taxes and we want to give our 58 counties the ability to decide for themselves it's not a vote about raising tobacco taxes it's a vote about establishing local control and stopping tobacco companies from pre-empting counties when it comes to reducing smoking we hope that you agree that counties deserve to decide from themselves and we respectfully ask for your aye vote anyone else in support of the measure please step forward and state your name and position Lindsey Freitas American Lung Association California and strong support Kali Hampton behalf the American Heart and American Stroke Association in support Meghan all right on behalf the California Dental Association also in strong support Terry Brennan on behalf of Service Employees Union California in support Christina Romero on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and strong support Arunima law on behalf of next-gen climate action in support Tama with

your Center Anderson is there anything in the bill that prohibits the money that's been taxed by the counties to be used for roads or or galas or anything other than for the purpose of reducing smoking depends on the use of the money depends on how the individual county determines it could be money that goes into a general fund in which case it would be distributed according to the budgetary prerogatives of the local jurisdiction or it could be specified how it's used thank you any other questions you know question we have a motion by Senator Hall would you like to close I ask for your

out that bill is out thank you we're item number for a be 11 second extraordinary session Nazarian cigarette tobacco product licensing fees and funding good afternoon please welcome and please present mr. chair senators AV 11 updates the cigarette and tobacco products licensing program by updating the licensing fee imposed on retail locations distributors and wholesalers the bill basically establishes annual fees as two hundred and sixty-five dollars for retail locations and $1,200 for distributors and wholesalers since 2003 BOE has administered the licensing program which levies licensing fees on businesses that sell and distribute tobacco products in the state since the launch of the program though the fee has not changed it has remained as a one-time fee of only $100 per retail location so all the work that our enforcement agents need to do it goes off of that single hundred dollars per new location that opens up annually in 2003 to 2004 the licensing fee generated 18 million which at the time was sufficient to maintain the program however over time the cost to run the program has exceeded the revenue generated from the fee Board of Equalization estimated for estimates for fiscal year 1314 the program cost nine point six million and only generated 1.8 million from licensees as boe requires payments from first five tobacco education prevention programs the breast cancer Research Fund and a general fund which receives cigarette and tobacco excise tax proceeds to cover the administration cost of the licensing program it is evident that the lifetime retailer fee is no is not adequate to maintain a viable enforcement program the additional revenue generated due to this bill will eliminate the need to divert tobacco excise taxes from their intended purposes a b11 is also good for businesses as it helps to stop violators from circumventing the law and competing with legitimate establishments who need the enforcement arm of the state to help protect their their business with that I want to introduce into individuals in support of this bill autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society action I'm sorry American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and Monique Ramos with first five California thank you good afternoon chair and members autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in strong support of assembly bill 11 this bill is important because it will preserve critical programs by ensuring there's adequate funding revising the cigarette and tobacco products licensing Act to increase licensing fees the Board of Equalization will be able to cover the cost of the program without having to take funding from other critical programs that are already suffering this bill is here today just because we've changed the date and we strongly encourage you to vote aye thank you thank you Monique Ramos on behalf of first 5la as well as first five California in strong support of baby 2x11 consist this measure is consistent with the state audit with an audit that was released last week by the state auditor and it would ensure that this program is self-sustaining and that overrate is returned to services

RVif3eQ4dm8,CA,03-08-2016,"hearing we're gonna start at the subcommittee until we get members here so we can establish quorum good afternoon madam vice chair that will be dispensing with three bills today all of which are part of the second extraordinary session we also have one bill that is still on file that will go directly to the floor under 28.8 that measure is a b x - 7 by member stone although our agenda is short I like to just reiterate the message to the audience and members providing testimony this afternoon that we want to limit our testimony to the fiscal aspects of the bill please refrain from lengthy policy discussions and if the sergeant's can continue calling member absent committee members we do have assembler Thurmond here mr. Thurmond please come forward members this is a B X - 9 bi assembler Thurman's the floor is yours [Applause] Thank You mr. chair and members stated I'm here to present a B 2 X 9 this bill would ensure that all of our campuses public schools statewide are tobacco-free including from East cigarettes and smokeless tobacco we have over 1,200 districts that are not considered tobacco-free and largely need to have signage and policies that dictate that they'll be tobacco-free and that's where the primary costs where did this bill is focused the estimated cost is about two hundred and thirty thousand dollars primarily to support signage for all of our campus while small costs that we think as it relates to keeping our kids healthy and safe from addiction and from other illnesses and with that we would respectfully ask for an aye vote thank you when is this in support good afternoon Lindsey Freitas with the American Lung Association in California here in strong support we feel that this bill is one of the number one ways to really ensure that youth do not pick up the tobacco schools that enforce 100% tobacco-free policies actually have lower smoking rates and this directly correlates to lower health care costs down the road so we strongly support this bill thank you did you know witnesses is a part Alysia Sanchez representing the California Medical Association in

Mendoza secretary please call the roll the motion is do pass to the Senate floor Lara aye Lara aye Bates Belle de Lyon Hill Hill aye Mendoza Mendoza aye Nielsen we're gonna keep that open to allow our ops the members to add on thank you do we have any additional authors I can go old school and just to shut down the committee like we used to do with mcdhh in it's very tempting back in the dank thank you for coming members this is a bx2 ten assembly bloom floors ABX 210 which is a bill that allows counties to place local tobacco tax measures on the ballot for a public vote there are currently over 600 jurisdictions outside of the state of California that have the ability to raise their own tobacco taxes in addition to the obvious health impacts for making cigarettes more expensive there is a financial benefit those 600 jurisdictions bring in over four hundred and thirty million dollars in revenue each year while reducing the smoking rate especially amongst youth there is no cost to the state and he costs incurred by the state for the startup and administration of a local tax program must be reimbursed by the counties that are enacting the tax therefore I respectfully ask for your aye vote Thank You mr. witnesses in support the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and you know we always believe that local governments should have the most impactful policy tools when it comes to improving health and reducing smoking should counties choose to increase their tobacco tax the financial benefit would be significant they would have the ability to reduce smoking and thus reduce healthcare costs while raising revenue to be spent however the Board of Supervisors and voters decide so we believe that our 58 counties deserve the option to decide for themselves whether or not raising the tobacco tax makes sense so we respectfully ask for your aye vote get additional witnesses in support Lindsay Freitas American Lung Association in California and support kula Koenig

are authorized to levy additional tobacco taxes tobacco consumption is expected to decrease because of cost pressure this will drive an unquantifiable decrease in general fund and special fund state tobacco tax revenues in addition additional cost to the Board of Equalization are expected in terms of the need to redesign its current IT system which is based on uniform statewide tax rate while these costs will ultimately be recovered through local and reimbursements the initial startup costs may need to be funded with in BO ease existing resources or through an additional general fund

distributors and wholesalers the bill establishes an annual fee as $265 per retail location and $1200 upon distributors and wholesalers since 2003 the Board of Equalization has administered the licensing program which levies licensing fees on businesses that sell and distribute tobacco products in the state since the launch of the program the fee has not changed it has remained as a one-time fee just a one-time fee per retail location and these fees go towards not only the first five la programs but as well as the enforcement that we help pay for the officers to ensure that these products are not sold to underaged minors in 2003 to 2004 the licensing fee generated 18 million which at the time was sufficient to maintain the program however over time the cost to run the program has exceeded the revenue generated from the fee Board of Equalization estimated for fiscal year 2013 to 14 the program cost nine point six million and only generated 1.8 million for licensees from licensees as a result the board requires payments from first five tobacco education prevention programs the Breast Cancer Research Fund and general fund which receive cigarette and tobacco excise tax proceeds to cover the administration cost of the licensing program it is evident that the lifetime retailer fee is not adequate to maintain a viable enforcement program the additional revenues generated due to this bill will eliminate the need to divert tobacco excise taxes from their intended purposes a b11 is also good for businesses as it helps to stop violators from circumventing the law competing with legitimate businesses so with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote and I'm joined with by autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society action that were witnesses in support autumn Ogden with American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in proud support of this bill currently the BOE diverts the excise tax revenue from critical programs such as the Breast Cancer Fund the tobacco control program and the general fund along with first five California to cover the cost of licensing tobacco by revising the cigarette and tobacco products licensing act to increase licensing fees the BOE will be able to cover the cost of the program without having to take funding from important programs that are already suffering as for your vote Thank You additional witnesses in support

program to become self-sufficient replacing the current $100 one-time fee with an annual fee of $265 is estimated to an additional nine point five million dollars annually Thank You comments or questions from committee senator Nielson afternoon Assemblyman Zellman Nazarian this is not a facetious question it's a very sincerely asked question if marijuana is legalized in California is it contemplated that that it will also be licensed the marijuana as it will be taught tobacco too will be legislation to include it under taxation and under licensing III this bill does not cover that no no I know it and you wouldn't because that would be prospective you don't know if it is or not sure it were it to be is it contemplated and considered that it would make logical sense there is of course uh but I think that would require a whole other conversation given that we've already been through certain conversations and as legislation that was carried last year did not necessarily put marijuana use and enforcement under the purview of ABC this is under the purview of ABC enforcement so I think that would probably require us to have a future conversation on figuring out where exactly and and on that note I'll just use the privilege of saying you know if this is to go forward I hope that our input as legislators legislative body and state government is heard and there's enough of a tax put into place to ensure that there's adequate and appropriate enforcement of future of marijuana legalization thank you thank you additional comments or questions from committee

eDNsfsn9FOs,CA,08-25-2015,"good afternoon and welcome I call to order today's hearing in the second extraordinary session of the Public Health and Developmental Services Committee we have a number of bills to be heard today we're gonna be moving through the presentations and public comment efficiently and everyone's gonna have a chance to speak a couple quick announcements will hear two witnesses per side with a time limit of three minutes each on each bill additional witnesses please state only your name and organization for the record and your position on the measure in order to allow everyone a chance to be heard during the public comment period please make sure to limit your testimony to your name organization or city and your position on the measure the sergeant-at-arms will monitor and if need be cut off anyone not adhering to those requirements please no clapping booing or other disruptive behavior during the hearing again the sergeant's will be involved and escort anyone out of the hearing room who's displaying such behavior from the hearing room and not allowing us to conduct this important state business and have this hearing proceed in an efficient way we this was noticed before but the informational component of our hearing today has been cancelled will be hearing six bills today and they're on our agenda and we have as the first in the queue agenda item number 1a be x26 assembly member Cooper on electronic cigarettes mr. Cooper whenever you ready sir Thank You mr. chair and members I accept the committee's technical amendments a b x 2-6 would apply an electronic cigarettes as a tobacco product in the stop tobacco access to kids Enforcement Act this bill will also include e-cigarettes in the California cigarette and tobacco licensing act a smoke-free act and if we require child resistant packaging for e-cigarettes this bill is about preventing an entire new generation of nicotine addicts in 2013 there were 600,000 high school students who use nicotine just last week a study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published on the in the Journal of American medicine found that students who use e-cigarettes or four times more likely to try traditional cigarettes the vast majority of e-cigarettes users smoke both east cigarettes in traditional cigarettes companies know that once someone is addicted to nicotine there's a good chance they'll also smoke traditional cigarettes if companies have to call these products tobacco products it makes it harder for them to convince youth that these cigarettes are a harmless alternative studies have found that ten chemicals found in proposition 65 warning on chemicals that have been found to cause cancer birth defects or other reproductive harm it is hard to take seriously the claim that e-cigarettes are not marketed for children with flavors like banana split cotton candy gummy bears and skittles nicotine as we know is highly addictive an addiction is Nick to nicotine usually starts early in life about 90% of people who smoke cigarettes start before the age 19 and about three of every four teenagers teenage smokers continue to adulthood adolescence is a crucial time for brain development research suggests that when nicotine addition starts in that lesson it's harder to kick as an adult the crux this bill is that we define e cigarettes as what they are a tobacco product this is crucial in protecting young people from beginning from becoming addicted to nicotine because the most common-sense way to keep these cigarettes out of our children's hands children are impressionable this is a very real danger that e-cigarettes will renormalize smoking behavior and make something that children have never seen before appear cool and that is engaging in smoking behavior in public places like restaurants and other public places despite what opponents claim these cigarettes are tobacco products the nicotine and e-cigarettes is derived from the tobacco plant without tobacco there would be no electronic nicotine delivery vices the vast majority these projects do not do indeed have nicotine the reason they exist in the first place is to maintain nicotine addiction for the few products that have do not have nicotine and makes sense to regulate them as tobacco products because it's impossible for code enforcement and law enforcement officials to tell which product contain nicotine and which do not the use of e-cigarettes is still an act that stimulates smoking and the best way for enforcement officials to deal with them is to treat them like a tobacco product this bill is sponsored by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network American Heart Association American Lung Association California narcotic Officers Association in the California college and university police chief Association I respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you something member Cooper and you have some witnesses with you today mr. chair members of the committee my name is John Lovell and I represent two of the co-sponsors of the bill the California college and university police chiefs Association the California and narcotic Officers Association I'm also here on behalf of the California police chiefs Association and I received word this morning that the California Association of code enforcement officers has also come on in support of the bill this bill is fundamentally about children the growth of e-cigarettes among children has been nothing short of alarming mr. Cooper's bill will bring East cigarettes under the rubric of the stake Act which is a proven strategy for keeping tobacco products out of the hands of children it will also define these products for what they are tobacco products we are very proud to co-sponsor this bill and we commend mr. Cooper for bringing this forward Thank You mr. Lovell good afternoon mr. chair and members I'm Tim Gibbs with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we're also proud co-sponsors of this bill because as assembly member Cooper mentioned this bill is about preventing an entire new generation of nicotine addicts you know it's critical for this bill that we define e cigarettes as a tobacco product the nicotine in e-cigarettes is derived from the tobacco plant you know other than a weak age verification law we have no other regulations on e-cigarettes in California the tobacco companies have been relentless in preventing these products from being regulated now we're at the cusp of meaningful regulation of e-cigarettes in California unfortunately a opponents on the Spill insists that any regulation take place under the faulty premise that e-cigarettes are not tobacco products the tobacco companies have been waging a battle all across this country to drive a wedge between how we regulate e-cigarettes and how we regulate combustible tobacco products for the most part students know that tobacco is dangerous the tobacco companies want to maintain the fiction that e-cigarettes are safe it's an abhorrent business strategy when those companies depend on hooking millions of young people on nicotine through e-cigarettes to eventually sell more combustible cigarettes you know the consensus is clear each cigarettes or tobacco products internationally you have the World Health Organization recommends that e-cigarettes be treated as a tobacco product at the national level you have the CDC and FDA FDA have recommended that e-cigarettes be treated as a tobacco product at the state level you have the California Department of Public Health report from the State Health Officer on the dangers of e-cigarettes that recommends that e-cigarettes be regulated as a tobacco product on the local level you have a hundred seventy eight cities and counties that regulate e-cigarettes as a tobacco product more than forty percent of this population are 40 percent of our population in California is covered by laws that essentially do the same thing as this bill and we have our largest cities like Los Angeles San Diego San Francisco who all have what is essentially this bill protecting their citizens so to protect children from becoming addicted to nicotine to protect workers from inhaling secondhand each cigarette aerosol air assault and to improve the health of all Californians we ask for your aye vote thank you seeing a quorum president Madam Secretary please call the roll Bonta here mainshine Baker Bonilla Campos Eduardo Garcia Levine Mayes Santiago steinorth stone Thurmond wood we have a quorum Thank You additional witnesses in support please state only your name organization or city and position on the measure video born representing American Academy of pediatric California division in support start with Kaiser Permanente and strong support has been Gordon with the California block Health Network and strong support Breanna Pittman with the California Dental Association and strong support at least his Sanchez representing the California Medical Association in support Whitney Stanford on behalf of first five California in the first five Association in strong support thank you Deputy Attorney General Matt Campbell on behalf of Attorney General Kamala Harris in support Jerry Jeffy representing the California chronic care Coalition in support David Ford for the Association of Northern California oncologists in the medical oncology Association of Southern California in support Kimberly Chen with the California pan-ethnic Health Network in strong support that's the arm spring with the county health executives association and strong support Tim Ryan representing the California Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians and the California Chapter of the American College of Cardiology in sport so I assume on behalf of Health Access California and supports chair and members Sean south on behalf of the California Primary Care Association in support Lindsay Freitas American Lung Association in California proud co-sponsor in strong support Terry Brown on behalf of Service Employees International Union proud member of saved lives California Coalition strong support Kali Hampton behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association proud co-sponsor Vanessa here on behalf of California Society of Anesthesiologists and support Michael Ratigan on behalf of the Board of Supervisors Santa Clara County in support amber came with the association of California healthcare districts in support Justin Garrett with the March of Dimes in support dr.

Officers Association of California and support Nicole woman on behalf of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and support Farra McDade ting on behalf of the California State Association of counties in support thank you seeing no additional witnesses in support I want to thank you for stating your position so clearly and efficiently will now go to witnesses in opposition to testify please come forward to the table as indicated earlier there's three minutes each please proceed whenever you're ready good afternoon chairman and members my name is Carrie Hess and I'm here today to ask you to oppose this bill in three capacities first as a former smoker of 21 years second as co-owner of North Cal vape in Redding and third as a registered addiction specialist with almost ten years of experience who believes that vapor products are the best and most successful tool for harm reduction in nicotine management ever invented please note that I am not affiliated with big tobacco in any way and I'm here in a voluntary capacity the vapor industry supports common-sense regulations to strengthen California's existing ban on sales to minors as well as child resistant packaging however we cannot support this bill because it falsely Divine's tobacco free products as tobacco so I have to ask why is it so important to Devine to define vapor products as tobacco you may have heard that it is because they contain nicotine and that nicotine can only come from the tobacco plant this is incorrect in addition to the tobacco plant nicotine is naturally found in many vegetables including eggplants potatoes - potatoes tomatoes and more you have also heard the argument that including e-cigarettes in the statutory definition of tobacco is necessary to protect the children this is also incorrect every pivot provision in this measure to protect children can be advanced using the current definition of e-cigarettes many vapor products do not contain nicotine at all the sponsor of this bill has repeatedly claimed that e-cigarettes are not nicotine free this is simply untrue manufacturers in California have invested millions into equipment and procedures dedicated to manufacturing non nicotine products and moreover those vapor products which do contain nicotine are clearly labeled as such it does not make any sense to categorize a non nicotine product as a tobacco product the argument that we are marketing to minors is offensive and inaccurate vapor products are created by adults for adults several studies have shown that flavors are an integral part of the vaping experience as they help adults to break their taste - deadly tobacco - radio reiterate our sole overriding issue with this bill is that it defines vapor products as tobacco we support the bills provision related to minors and in fact all of the policy goals contained in this bill can be achieved by using the existing statutory definition for e-cigarettes we cannot emphasize enough that we wholeheartedly share the goal of protection for minors but we cannot support our product being lumped into the same statutory definition as combustible cigarettes mr. chair members I would ask each of you to consider if you want your legacy to be the continued propagation in prolonging of the tobacco epidemic if the author of this bill were proposing appropriate regulation specifically for vapor products we might support it however the legislation being proposed today unfortunately persists in using inaccurate and illogical definition for e-cigarettes as tobacco products and for this reason we must strongly oppose this measure Thank You next witness good afternoon chair and distinguished members of the committee my name is gregory connelly and i am here today on behalf of a nonprofit called the american vaping association which advocates for responsible in science-based policy towards vapor products otherwise known as electronic cigarettes earlier this month I proudly celebrated five years as a non smoker thanks to vapor products the August 2010 was my quit date and I'm here today to urge you to oppose this bill not just because it falsely redefines tobacco product to include often nicotine free products and tobacco free products but also because you are falsely redefining California's definition of smoking to include the use of a smoke free product as my colleague is noted the vapor industry is not opposed to common-sense reasonable regulation we would love to see sting operations happening today in vape shops across California to ensure that sales are not being made to minors however this bill goes about in a completely backwards and illogical way the idea that we must define these tobacco free smoke free and often nicotine free products as tobacco simply does not make sense do you do you see whether or not the California Legislature has decided that something is tobacco what evidence do they have that this classification would actually reduce usage in any way different than if we simply created these stop vapor products sales to youth act it would not have as friendly of an acronym mistake but it would be an effective bill that would protect youth as somebody who considers himself to be not only a public health advocate but also an anti-smoking advocate it has continually surprised me over the past five six years that so-called anti-smoking groups groups that dedicated supposedly their lives to ending the smoking epidemic have been the loudest most vociferous voices against these smoke-free products especially now in the light of last week's released by public health England a very respected watchdog a report finding these smoke-free tobacco-free products to be at least 95 percent less hazardous and smoking that they pose no known risk to bystanders and that there's no evidence of a Gateway effect the study referenced earlier does not actually show any sort of Gateway effect it is like saying that teens who experiment with red wine versus teens who never experiment with red wine which of those teens do you expect will go on to drink vodka in the future which of them will be more likely that is what they were saying with this study they found that teens had experimented with vapor products one year later the teens who had experimented with vapor products more likely to have reported smoking just one cigarette so there's no gateway effect being shown smoking over the past three four years a record dramatic decline of forty percent never before seen so this idea that this is creating a new generation of smokers and this is leading to smoking is simply false thank you very much thank you very much additional witnesses in opposition my name is Mario weeks I represent the vapor spot and we vehement ly oppose

opposed this bill and Jerry Pelt from Palm Springs California and I strongly oppose thank you see no other witnesses in opposition we can entertain any questions or comments from members of the committee Assemblymember Baker yes please Thank You mr. chairman mr. Cooper can you please address the question regarding the definition of tobacco and I just address one of the main points that was raised and I could benefit from that I think it's very interesting that our speaker over here spoke about vegetable or plant products being used I've never heard of that and well they some of those vegetables may contain contain nicotine nicotine primarily comes from tobacco that is what is used and it's funny that 95 season counties in California already have some type of e-cigarette regulation in many of the counties and cities these folks live in and come from already regulated so it so it is a tobacco product nicotine is the addictive portion of it bottom line no if ands or buts about it I spent 30 years as a police officer and 10 years working narcotics nicotine is addictive that's those laws were passed in with tobacco sure it's been extracted from the tobacco plant but it's still highly addictive with it and it's just it's just disingenuous and these folks say that it is it and one thing I do support a cessation it's a great job it says smoking cigarettes it's much better but the fact is it still contains nicotine and that's the bottom line just a little bit farther please yeah and you mentioned the the counties throughout California that already do this does your bill in any way affect the ability of local jurisdictions to choose their own path in this regard let's say if they want to have something more strict or it would allow for that okay and the final one is what are other states doing in this regard of you you've probably had an opportunity to sample that can you there quite a few states that regulated it's just really all over the board and right now it's the Wild West the FDA does not regulate it some folks spoke about some of these cigarettes that supposedly don't contain nicotine well the FDA has done some tests and actually found nicotine and some of those devices so really it's unregulated everything we pretty much we eat and drink is regulated by the FDA there's some law addressing that with this there is no law so it's up to that individual manufacturer and while the most of them I'm sure are good businessman yeah some that that aren't well I guess what I was getting more to is have you seen and there may not be any Studies on this if a similar statute has had the effect of helping or hurting cessation well the bottom line I guess it comes down to if this passes today this bill goes through and passes what does it do these folks can still buy their vape cigarettes nothing changes this puts in legislation where it defines it as a tobacco product so I mean to me in my mind it doesn't really change anything they can still buy it they can still sell it so maybe there isn't it may be that there's no study out there that has looked at what the experience the effect that these laws have had on on the use of smoked tobacco that's really what I was curious about if in preparing this bill if you've looked at that and I'll I'll tell you I'm leaning towards supporting your bill so I'm not trying to say you don't know it's more along the lines if I but I am curious if you've seen from other states that may have had any regulation of e-cigarettes similar to what you're proposing if it has had an effect positive or negative on cessation sure there have been other states that have passed legislation that's that's fairly similar to this you know we know in California with 178 cities and counties that have passed a cigarette no regulations that do treaty cigarettes like a tobacco product it has had in effect in terms of you know the the sort of renormalization of smoking behavior you know having children watch grown-ups smoke you know use e-cigarettes in restaurants in you know public places where people gather is has a detrimental effect to your specific question on whether or not there are studies that have shown and and an ordinance or a state law that passed that that treats cigarettes specifically as a tobacco product you know I can only tell you what we know in California and that those cities and county instead of past this you know we are seeing the the sort of explosion of e-cigarette usage you know all over the state and you know it's it's definitely time to act in California and the the those cities have certainly seen a you know a that the explosion is tempered shall we say any other questions or comments from members dr. wood yeah this is my question a couple questions for the people opposing the bill there I believe it was you sir that said that there really hadn't been a dramatic increase in the use of these products by young people there absolutely has been an increase in experimentation of vapor products I mean you said it was they try like one cigarette and then they'd be done what I was saying was that there were two points I made regarding youth smoking which was there's been a rapid dramatic record decline of 40% in teen smoking and two federal surveys between 2011 and 2014 and also that the study that was brought up that was published in JAMA last week that is being used to say there is a gateway effect from true vapor products to traditional cigarettes the authors of that study have come out and said that that's not a proper conclusion to draw because all they did was see okay of course somebody who's willing to try a vapor product is the kind of person that's going to be willing to try a cigarette and they'll be more willing to try a cigarette then somebody who won't even try a vapor product a couple other follow-up questions do the chair you said there are lots of other chemicals in these vapors there are and I'm and I think it would be hard to deny that when you when you when someone execs exhales this you see this this vapor there are other chemicals I'm not aware of studies that have been done to say whether they're harmful or not but I I believe one of you said the vapor is essentially harmless but then you I believe said that it's 95 percent less hazardous which implies that there still is a hazard direct that was the two authors of the public health England report essentially giving a worst-case scenario for the future and that is worst case scenario for the user and what we do know is that inhalable medications like the Nicorette inhaler that's made by Pfizer or GSK there are international standards for what levels of different chemicals are allowed to be present in the vapor in the mist that comes off of inhalable medicines and the levels for the actual user even assuming that the user is taking 600 puffs a day which no one in this room actually does the levels are below for the user what is allowed to be contained in inhalable medicine so then you're talking about bystanders where it is a Manute amount that the you that the user is actually exposed to versus the bystander so absolutely there are chemicals but there are chemicals in everything I was in Starbucks this morning California perhaps more than any other state has done more to miss educated citizens through proposition 65 because in Starbucks they were warning me about carcinogens in the car-rental place they were warning me about carcinogens no one in this state as far as I know actually pays attention to those signs anymore because they recognize yeah everything has chemicals it's the levels that matter not the mere presence and what one final question and thank you for your thank you for your interesting it sounded like rain I believe I'm under stood that you your prompt one of your primary it could be comfortable for both of you your primary objection to this bill is that that this defines ecig res as tobacco products is that fair to say so I come from a city where I was when I was the mayor last year we actually passed legislation in the city of Healdsburg that did not define - about the e-cigarettes as tobacco products but we defined them what we did was we we we by statute by legislation created a situation where they were treated like tobacco products exactly through the same mechanism that we do for other other things so I'm curious would you object to that because if you're if you're if your assertion is that is the definition that bothers you I wonder I'd love to hear what you have to say about that of course if this bill was amended to make vapor products non tobacco products to put them in their own category it would be better but there is a vast difference between the kinds of regulations that local governments enact so I guess the answer is no the answer is the bill would be a heck of a lot better but we'd still like to work out some kinks okay thank you thank you additional questions or comments from members mr. chair yes mr. Garcia I I know that it's been alluded several times this public health study done by the United Kingdom and from what I've read in the executive so I might be lying to your fight said I've read the entire study it does two things I think it says one that the use of vaping e-cigarettes are less harmful than your traditional cigarette and then it also in my opinion does not highlight a couple of things that I think are extremely important and that's the data that would say here are the long-term impacts of vaping are utilizing these devices and to me where I get stuck here is where it does not give it a clean bill of health saying that it is not harmless what I think of when I get to that point is that it is said that 500,000 people I'm gonna estimate give or take die from smoking cigarettes in the United States so the number of 95 percent less harmful if I'm looking at it from the standpoint of people's public health and fatality rates that would mean that only you know 25 26 thousand people would die by using this type of device according to the study that the United Kingdom has put forward that it is 95 percent less harmful so I get caught there where we have a situation where we take a zero risk position or we lower the level of the threshold if I may for lack of term in terms of the harm that it could cause if consumed and so that's one can you kind of address some of your comments sort of points the vast vast majority of users of these products are either smokers people inhaling burning smoke into their lungs on a daily basis or they are ex smokers who have switched and I believe that if you had the two distinguished authors here before you today they would not say that 25,000 people of the 500,000 per year that they would actually die from vapor product usage they are using that as the worst case scenario the best number that would be easily understood by the general public the general public tends to think in zeroes and fives if they say 97 98 it's a little more confusing than just saying 95 I think that that would translate into there have been Studies on other products a month off of someone's life versus if you average a huge poll of people that have used the product a month off their life perhaps versus smoking where you have six seven years of one-third of the people who smoke plus many more so you know the United Kingdom I which I think and please correct me if I'm wrong is a member of the European Union I may be a all right correct in the European Union many of the countries there have adopted far more stricter regulations and I'm sorry and and you know labeling as it relates to what these products contain the limited amount of actual nicotine in these products and of course the the type of marketing that is done my assumption is you're probably not in favor of though those types of regulations we would be perfectly happy to have the FDA step down with reasonable regulations on labeling on good manufacturing practices etc we are grateful gravely concerned about individual states doing this because then you end up with 50 different regulations on labeling 50 different regulations on what can be in the liquid and that's disastrous for small businesses especially those here today that don't have the resources of a large tobacco company behind them and I'll add that in those European countries that have taken stiff positions in the Asian countries that have pretty much banned at the advice of groups like those supporting these bills smoking is not declining in the way that it is declining in countries like the UK where you have stop smoking clinics actually offering support to e-cigarette users I can't imagine in the United States actually seeing cancer heart or lung say one positive thing about vapor products let alone have their stop smoking support services actually lend support to people looking to quit smoking thank you I wanted just to just comment that you know I've had the opportunity to speak to a number of local business owners who are concerned about the added cost to the business and you know one of the conversations that I had was I mean I'm not sure what type of price tag you put on public health in the lives of individuals some remember Cooper alluded to the industry by no means I believe the intention of this bill is to eradicate the the business aspect of e cigarettes and vaping people we'll still have the ability to purchase these just simply under a different criteria an umbrella in order for the purposes of regulation and so I you know I I've not heard anyone a lot of the comments and conversations have been I won't be able to stay in business because of this policy and shifting it over under the tobacco legal coats can you kind of I think the point of this bill is that it continues the campaign that the California Department of Public Health started back in January where they started running commercials misleading smokers and misleading adults into believing that vaping may be as hazardous of smoking that is the goal of these groups is to make adults believe that the jury is still out on whether vaping is any different from any other tobacco product I think that's morally wrong I think it's scientifically wrong and that is their goal that has been their goal since 2009 when they tried to get the FDA to ban these things to adults but that would be in line with the public health report from the United Kingdom right I think the jury is still out and tertiary public health implications right my apologies for interrupting the jury is still out on exactly whether it's ninety five percent ninety seven ninety eight ninety four percent there is no doubt and even some of the most virulent Lee Anne Tuohy vaping researchers at the University of California San Francisco even freely admit if you prod them a little bit but yes obviously using a vapor product is far less hazardous than smoking let me just close by saying that I certainly support those individuals who are here and who have you know shared in the past and in the more recent conversations that this has changed their life that this has improved their health that their marriages have improved and and that they've become better role models for their children but it doesn't change my outlook from the standpoint that there is still some harmful contaminant in these products that is really at the core of the conversation today so I just wanted to close with those comments thank you other comments or questions from members some of the member Thurmond a mr. chair I want to thank the author for bringing this bill I want to thank those who testified and supporting against and for all those who've come here to speak because this is not an issue that is clear very very much so you know I'm no expert on and I got a lot of questions and I appreciate it hearing all the perspectives and from all the I think the entire industry was here today so you know thank you for sharing look I'm happy for all the folks who said that this has helped that e-cigarettes has helped them to stop smoking I do have some critical questions though because I think that this is a serious issue and is impacting young people in a serious way and I really like the nexus that the author of this bill is making between potential harm for children as it relates to e-cigarettes and so I'm going to ask some questions particularly to the opposition about things that I have read and heard that seem factual and and I think we should discuss first one is isn't it a fact that e-cigarettes contain nicotine and if that is true shouldn't we be passing this bill and doing everything that we can to keep to keep nicotine I'm sorry nicotine out of children's hands we should be doing things to keep nicotine out of children's hands that can be done without defining these products as tobacco and also unlike the FDA the FDA has stated that if a product a component or a part of a vapor product does not contain nicotine they will not be regulating it as a tobacco product that's in there deeming regulation that came out last April but this bill would make even non nicotine products devices just batteries that people sell they would become tobacco products but under the FDA's rules they would not be that's a good argument but my guess is that no one's gonna buy the vaping device without buying what goes with it that's incorrect why why would somebody here could tell you better than me but there are many vapors who step down off of nicotine there are people who want to quit and they want to get off nicotine immediately my colleague would like to have happy to hear thank you so as a business owner with a retail vape shop approximately 10 to 15 percent of all the e-liquid that we sell contains no nicotine and we've seen a dramatic trend in the two years that we've been in business to where people have made a ship lower lower lower in nicotine and now they like to having a huge component of help how electronic cigarettes help people quit is because it mimics the hand-to-mouth motion the habit of it and so even when people are have wean themselves down they still like to continue participating in the habit however they are celebrating not not using non nicotine products so it doesn't make sense at all to me to classify a non nicotine product as a tobacco product under this bill let's continue that line of thinking and I that's very helpful to know but as I've been reading some studies about when young people use e-cigarettes mostly many have said that they've never tried traditional cigarettes before and so in the case of young people they wouldn't be buying the the vaping devices to step down if they have never smoked a cigarette before what we're finding is that yes there are large large swathes of youth that have tried vapor products that have never smoked but when you actually start to boil it down look at past 30 day usage and then go further the 2015 California healthy youth survey as well as other surveys that are being done across this country now are actually looking at times of the month days of the month that someone has used the vapor product and when you get down to where there's actual habitual use over ten days a month 95% plus 90 percent plus 98% plus in some states are either smokers or X smokers so there is a vast difference in the literature about nicotine gum patch lozenge other smoke free nicotine products where they've given them to people with Alzheimer's with people with other diseases that may have some benefit to nicotine they don't develop a dependence there's a vast difference between inhaling burning smoke literally freebasing nicotine and a vapor product or any other smoke-free nicotine product and if I may the studies actually don't differentiate whether these children are using products that contain nicotine or no nicotine so theoretically every single teenager who's been in this study has vaped a product with no nicotine so the study isn't well rounded or accurate because it doesn't even differentiate whether nicotine is used by the youth different question but I'm gonna follow on the train that you were just going about please we talked about lung capacity absolutely I just read just now as we're having this conversation a study that says ten minutes of smoking e-cigarettes causes noticeable change in airway resistance in the lungs and so again I'm gonna always come at you from the standpoint of I think this is good for young people and if we know that when things are exposed to young people that could put them in further harm's way down the line I would say as in this case why not pass this legislation if we know that vaping creates resistance airway resistance in the lungs particularly for young people I'm putting the lens of young people on it sir with all due respect dr. Michael Siegel who's a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health one of the original anti-smoking advocates who's testified against the tobacco industry never taken a dime from them he commented on that very study that I believe you are referencing and referenced another study finding that when people sit in a sauna for 10 minutes that cause is about the same level of airway resistance that does not indicate any kind of harm short-term irritation does not indicate any kind of harm and there's a great paper that I really encourage you to read regardless of how you vote today lung harm reversal pilosa pol osa or an Italian researcher collected the evidence on studies that have asked followed vapors throughout months or years to look at their lung capacity to survey them about their lung capacity and you have smokers people who smoked for 40 years people some of these people here today probably used to have an oxygen machine or used to walk with a cane but because they get the same of quitting smoking the lung capacity returning even though they are vaping that is that is what is happening in the real world not in a clinical study that just looks at what happens after 10 minutes thank you sir yeah right yet for the questions anymore okay we're gonna go some of member Thurmond has his questions that he's wrapping up and then miss Baker had one but doesn't and we can entertain a motion now I'd like to move the bill we have a motion we have a second thank you mr. Thurmond continue thank you then we'll move on I I didn't read that study but I'm happy to read it when you meet me at the sauna we'll read it together about that the last one really is about the flavors of vapor and I have a hard time accepting that these are not products being catered to young people when there are flavors such as gummy bear or other flavors that appear to be geared toward young people and it just seems to me that if we want to protect young people we would do everything in our power to do so including say that we pass this bill so that young people aren't getting access to these products well I would just add before going into flavors you can get the same effect as this bill the sting operations retail licensing without defining them as tobacco products on flavors five years ago August 10 2010 I quit smoking with a watermelon flavored vapor product and since then everything that I've used has been a flavor that opponents will describe as child-friendly or intentionally marketed to attract children today I have mango if you asked this room if you are using something other than tobacco or menthol are you using gummy bear or a gum or anything of that sort that they want to falsely paint which has been something going on for six years we have a great study a survey of 4500 adult vapors finding that 70% plus their main flavor was either fruit or something sweet and that they rated flavor availability sorry as extremely important in staying smoke-free and so flavors are incredibly important and I would urge you to talk just the vapors in your community the people that have quit smoking and asked them what they're using and I think many of you would be surprised we don't agree but I appreciate your discussion on the facts thank you sir thank you thank you we have a motion we have a second assembly member Cooper would you like to close please sir please first of all I want to thank all our speakers for coming out here today I truly appreciate it and it is a cessation device the folks that got off tobacco products I applaud you it's tough nicotine is addictive it's hard to get off of so I think it's a good thing you're off of this this is really about our children and author to my speaker to my left set it large swaths of you try cigarettes and that's the bottom line and you could say tobacco whatever is still the product in tobacco is nicotine that is very addictive and we want to make sure our kids have a chance to grow up and not experience this it is an issue right now you go out in the streets you see a lot of e-cigarettes a lot of kids smoking these cigarettes a lot of your operations for alcohol and cigarette buying underage decoy operations they involve cigarettes for a reason because kids are buying cigarettes that's what we're doing those programs because they do consume it this makes it more appealing more attractive these kids and young kids especially teenagers are easily influenced and some of these names do influence them in the bottom line this bill you can still buy e-cigarettes doesn't change that you can still sell these cigarettes you can still smoke e-cigarettes what does it change the definition the legislation nothing else so it the rules today remain the same except for the legislation so I really don't know what the big deal is and we're trying to protect our kids it's a bottom line so I respectfully ask for your support for this bill thank you Thank You mr. Cooper we have a motion of do pass as amended to finance it's been seconded Madam Secretary please call the roll Bonta i Vantaa I maintain maintain aye Baker aye Baker aye Bonilla campus Eduardo Garcia Eduardo Garcia aye Levine Levine I maze Santiago Santiago aye steinorth Stein north no stone Thurmond Thurmond I would would I the bill passes with a vote of 8 to 1 Thank You mr.

members I'll speak slowly well advocates come up but I am here to present a bx2 10 a bill that allows counties to place local tobacco tax measures on the ballot for a public vote the tax would only go into effect if two-thirds majority of the voters approved of course smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States and at least 30 percent of cancer deaths and 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking nationally one out of every 5 deaths is attributable to smoking and in California 40,000 people lose their lives to tobacco related illness each year and tens of thousands of Californians struggle every day because of tobacco related illness treatment for these ailments is often expensive medical spends almost 3.5 billion dollars paying for tobacco related illness despite this California currently has one of the lowest tobacco taxes in the country mr. chair move the bill back in 30 finnicky we have a motion in a second with thank you with an 87 percent tax per pack compared to the national average almost twice that a dollar 60 these rates have in California have not been raised in over 15 years and we know the tobacco taxes work for every 10% increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes there's a 4% read and overall cigarette consumption and a 6.5 percent reduction in youth consumption and this is one of the reasons why this bill is so important young people the Surgeon General projects that without a major reversal in trance 5.6 million youth aged 0 to 17 living today will die prematurely from tobacco use those are completely preventable deaths and today it is estimated that 16 percent of high school students 16 percent are addicted to cigarettes this is in spite of all the work we've done in the successes that we've had I think it's an important point that we're not there yet it's 16 percent of high school students are addicted to cigarettes and 1 in 4 use some form of tobacco though there's widespread education on the dangers of tobacco availability and deceptive marketing continues to lure our youth to try these dangerous products so this bill is an important step to fight tobacco addiction and tobacco related illness and will allow California counties to join over 600 local jurisdictions nationwide that have their own cigarette taxes or fees these jurisdictions bring in more than four hundred and thirty million dollars in annual revenue and working effectively and are working for effectively to reduce smoking rates again especially amongst young people and to decrease smoking cause death disease and costs increasing the cost of cigarettes is one of the most powerful and direct ways to reduce smoking studies have shown that youth and low-income adults are especially likely to quit or reduce smoking smoking I'm sorry when prices increase no one is better equipped to know how to fight tobacco addiction on the local level and the voters themselves and this bill allows the Board of Supervisors of a county to propose these kinds of measures to their constituents the bill is a sensible measure to help counties deter tobacco use locally and I urge your aye vote Thank You mr. bloom witnesses in support good afternoon chair and members Lindsey Freitas with the American Lung Association in California this bill as was mentioned would remove the current prohibition against counties passing local taxes and help prevent kids from smoking improve public health and help generate local revenue nearly 40,000 Californians die from tobacco related illness each year and smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States killing more people than alcohol aids car accidents illegal drugs murder and suicide combined as the assembly member mentioned tobacco taxes whether the state federal local level have been a proven and effective way to reduce tobacco use among youth in particular a 10% increase leading to a 6 point 5 percent reduction in youths consumption in California we currently have 21,000 youth who start smoking every year and over forty four hundred and forty thousand kids under the age of 18 today that will ultimately die from tobacco-related disease by allowing counties to tax tobacco we can take help make sure they can take that step to ensure that these kids never start smoking and lower that number not only will this bill allow counties the opportunity to save lives but also money this bill will give counties a chance to pass a tax that will ultimately help save millions of dollars overall tobacco-related disease cost medic hell 3.5 billion dollars a year it inflicts thirteen point two nine billion in total medical expenses in our state each year and ten point three five billion dollars in lost productivity these numbers are a huge burden to our state on average California families tax burden from smoking caused government expenditure is seven hundred and forty five dollars per household on a County to County basis the cost of smoking varies from three hundred and seventy four dollars per resident in Orange County to over a thousand dollars per resident in Lake County and the total cost vary from around 300,000 in Alpine County a total cost to 4.4 billion dollars in Los Angeles County alone of all these associated Kaufman all of these associated costs will decrease as the number of people decrease smoking and this bill really gives counties the the empowerment to help make happen thank you good afternoon Tim Gibbs American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we're it's for this legislation because we think that local communities should be given a choice when it comes to going beyond state law to protect their citizens from the deadly effects of tobacco use allowing counties the ability that give voters a choice on whether a higher tobacco tax makes sense for the community is the essence of local control one of the most pernicious tactics that the tobacco companies use in order to stymie legislation ensure that no policies passed that result in fewer people smoking is to preempt local governments from passing tobacco control legislation their modus operandi is to pass a weak law at the state level where they wield more power and then prevent locals from improving on the weak policy the most part California has a long history of resisting the tobacco company's attempt to preempt local efforts to reduce smoking the reason we're able to pass the nation's first smoke-free workplace law was because local efforts made that happen local communities have the ability to decide for themselves on whether or not they want to protect workers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoking across the state communities active which eventually led to the state enact a new minimum standards for smoke-free workplaces many communities have chosen to go beyond the minimum standards since the state has set we've also resisted preemption excuse me in local licensing ordinances that give law enforcement the ability to enforce youth access laws unfortunately the one area where the tobacco companies have been successful in preventing local communities from protecting their citizens has been in taxes nearly 50 years ago California decided not to allow counties to levy tobacco taxes with one at 600 jurisdictions across the country that can live with you their own taxes we want to give our 58 counties the ability to decide for themselves this isn't a vote about raising taxes this is a vote about establishing local control and stopping the tobacco companies from pre-empting counties from reducing smoking we hope that you agree that counties deserve to decide from themselves and we respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you additional

Loper my name is gregory connelly again on behalf of the american vaping association while this bill does not impact vapor products at the moment would not give local counties the authority to tax them i would still urge opposition the speaker from the American Lung Association earlier I applaud her for accurately noting that it is smoking that kills it is smoking that results in 400,000 deaths plus per year it is smoking that results in the cost of Medicare Medicaid throughout this state is not smoke free tobacco and nicotine products some of which would be included in this bill such as Swedish snus which we have decades of evidence from Sweden on its effectiveness for helping smokers quit while we don't advocate for that individual product I advocate for any smoker to switch to any Nick not nicotine smoke free product because they are all far less hazardous whether it is the gum patch lozenge or if it is snus smokers deserve options and they don't deserve to be taxed possibly even more than they are on a pack of cigarettes for trying to get away from some okay thank you thank you additional witnesses in opposition mr. chair members James jack on behalf of the cigar Association of America and opposition Peter blocker at the California tax payers Association in opposition thank you seeing no additional witnesses in opposition we can go to questions and comments from members seeing Assemblymember Baker Thank You mr. chairman and Thank You mr. bloom for bringing this forward I struggled with this one a bit and I find one of I find the points that have been raised by the opposition compelling and in particular the the market chaos that was caused and also just making this become something that is almost an underground product because you can use it more across borders depending on what the taxation policy is there when our goal is I think a legitimate goal is to reduce reliance on this product so you know can you just address some of the points of opposition you may be doing that in your closing anyway but I would value that thank you I'm happy to and I'll allow the advocates to respond as well if that's all right i I just don't see this as a significant problem there may be different taxes in different jurisdictions but wherever one goes to shop one's going to pay the the taxes levied in that location and if there's some people going to a different County to purchase that doesn't change the overall impact of what we're trying to accomplish here yeah and more than 60% of smokers buy one pack at a time I mean the vast majority of smokers want to quit smoking buying a cart and driving to Nevada driving you know you know wherever the next county over where you're from it could be a long long way from Alameda County to Contra Costa County depending on traffic so you know most smokers don't want to make that commitment to buy multiple packs of cigarettes are going to stop at their local store and pay you know the tax that's in their local community an Assemblymember I challenged the notion that in 1967 the law was changed because of chaos in 1967 the law was changed to provide a statewide only statewide authorization in order to benefit the tobacco companies for the very reasons that we heard earlier it is easier for tobacco companies to restrict the amount of taxation at the state level than it is at the local level well thank you and I imagine what I think is very possible which is now perhaps someone buys one pack at a time but if they all they have to do is go from say Contra Costa County San Ramon into Pleasanton or Livermore and buy a lot more at once in order to avoid the tax that is a concern I have it's also somewhat more regressive as well if someone can just manage to pay the tax where the additional funds wherever it is they can do that unless they would rather go somewhere else and get them more in bulk that's a possibility I'm thinking of and and I have a constituency that many of my local towns are very aggressive against smoking and I find it is perfectly possible for them to say you're not going to do it in apartments you're not going to do it in streets and you're not going to do it in public anywhere and so I was persuade you know I liked the idea of local constituencies being able to decide this I'm a no vote today because I think there is this real possibility of just creating a very easy way for people to get around it and it can create either there's going to be bulk purchases or even driving it a little bit more underground than it already is thank you we have a motion we have a second some a member bloom would you like to close thank you well it sounds like at least one of our opponents sitting at the table here should have been in the support line because I was hearing a lot of support for the notion of taxing these tobacco products that we're talking about here today but I I want to be clear on this this is a very democratic measure this allows democratically elected local government officials to choose by their vote to ask the voters by a tooth majority to enact an increase in tax so there's a double layer of democracy here that we would be passing back to counties that we took away from them many years ago that will provide all the benefits that you've heard from today I don't talk about this a lot because it's a long time ago in my past but I used to work as a young person in a tobacco and candy warehouse and I could tell you at that time when we didn't have technology to help with the system of paying taxes it was really easy at that time we used to just iron on it was a way of applying the tax you you the the company would purchase would amount to little seals that went on each pack of cigarette and so you wrote a check to the State Board of Equalization as a distributor this is a very at that time it was not a complicated process it was very easy it hasn't gotten any more complicated for the industry it has only gotten easier to provide the the service that they provide as individuals so this is not going to have an impact on small businesses it's been claimed this is something that is simple to apply whatever county you might be in and I ask for your aye vote thank you Thank You mr. bloom we have a motion we have a second the motion is do pass Madame secretary please call the roll Bonta I ought to I may shine moonshine no Baker Baker no Bonilla Bonilla aye Campos Campos aye Garcia Garcia aye Levine Levine aye Mayes Santiago Santiago aye steinorth stein North no stone Thurmond Thurmond aye wood Wood aye the bill passes with a vote of eight to three Thank You mr. bull see I see some member Nazarian here welcome mr. Nazarian we are on to agenda item number 6a bx2 11 Nazarian cigarette and tobacco product licensing fees and funding mr. Nazarian whenever you're ready Thank You mr. chair and members since 2003 the Board of Equalization has administered the cigarette and tobacco products light sassing program which levies licensing fees on businesses that sell and distribute tobacco products in the state since the launch of the program a fee the fee has not changed for the last 12 years it has remained as a one-time fee of $100.00 per retail location and an annual $1,000 fee on distributors and wholesalers a b11 modernizes the program by updating the licensing fee imposed on retail locations distributors and wholesalers the bill establishes annual fees as two hundred and sixty five dollars per retail location annually and 100 a 1012 $1200 excuse me two distributors and wholesalers in 2003 to 2004 the licensing fee generated eighteen million which at that time was sufficient to maintain the program however because of the retailer fee and being one-time only the cost to run the program has exceeded the revenue generated from the fee according to the Legislative Analyst's Office between 2005 fiscal year 2005 six two fiscal year 2013-14 annual expenditures averaged 7 million more than the annual fee generated board of a Board of Equalization estimated for fiscal year 2013 to 14 the program cost of nine point six million and only generated 1.8 million from licenses licensees a lot of numbers here but bottom line is there's a shortfall we only generate 1.8 million while the enforcement takes about 12 million as a result Board of Equalization requires payment from special funds that receive cigarette and tobacco tax proceeds to cover the administration cost of licensing program it is evident that the lifetime retailer fee is not adequate to maintain a viable enforcement program which is good for businesses as it stops violators from circumventing the law and competing with legitimate businesses speaks to some of the concerns that I heard before a goal of the licensing program is to reduce illegal sales of cigarette and tobacco products and with me are three witnesses to speak on behalf of the bill thank you very much for your attention thank you mr. Nazarian that we since we have through it three witnesses it'll be two minutes each and we will give you the time indications please proceed good afternoon chairman and members of the committee kula Koenig with the American Heart Association American Stroke Association our goal at the AAA is to build lives free of cardiovascular disease and stroke we know that smoking increases the risk of heart disease and stroke by two to four times we are in support of this bill because it addresses a problem that has existed for far too long the Board of Equalization does not have adequate funding to cover the cost of running the tobacco licensing program by adjusting the fee structure as this bill proposes the BOE would generate approximately twelve million dollars equipping the organization with the resources it needs to prevent untaxed distribution and illegal sales of cigarettes and tobacco as Assemblymember Nazarian mentioned the BOE has stated that without the proper resources the organization would have a difficult time discouraging tax evasion which could result in decrease revenues for the fund they also noted that the lack of ability to enforce could jeopardize California's master settlement agreement payments if it is determined that California is not diligently enforcing its cigarette and tobacco product statutes the bill simply asks the valkyries least tailors to pay for the cost of doing business in the state similar organizations such as the alcoholic beverage control their license is $13,000 as a start-up fee where we're asking here two hundred and sixty five dollars this is fair and sensible public policy ask for your aye vote good afternoon Whitney Stanford on behalf of first five California and the first five Association first we want to thank mr. Assemblymember Nazarian for his leadership on this important issue the board of equalizations tobacco tax licensing administration and enforcement activities have increased by 700 percent over the last 10 years and now costs first-five an estimated 14 million dollars in annual proposition 10 funds during this same decade total first five tobacco tax revenue have decreased by 30 percent the 14 million dollar cost of BOE administration and enforcement pay out paid out of the first five fund is an amount roughly equal to the first five County Commission's statewide investment in health access programs including premiums outreach and enrollment or it is roughly equivalent to their total investments in infinite all their education and care programs clearly there are many alternative and more impactful uses of these critical funds in line with the mandates of proposition 10 a b 11 is a crucial step to resolve this cost to children's programs consistent with the intent of a b 71 in 2003 a b 11 would ensure that tobacco tax licensees bear the cost of ongoing licensing administration and enforcement activities and refocus first-five funds on their intended beneficiary children ages 0 to 3 in California thank you very much mr. chair members autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also proud support of assembly bill 11 this bill is important because it will preserve critical programs by ensuring there's enough funding for the licensing program in 2006 the legislature approved a budget proposal allowing the BOE to fill in the funding gap by siphoning from the four funding sources that receive money from excise tax the general fund the Breast Cancer Fund proposition 10 and proposition 99 which funds the tobacco control program the amount taken from each fund is directly proportional to the amount each fund receives the tobacco control program on the second highest of these funds has saved over a million lives and has saved the state over 100 a billion since it was first started unfortunately the program is underfunded and part 2 and part due to this licensing program it receives currently 17% of the funding recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the reduction means fun the reduction and funding means that the benefits of the program have also decreased the money from these funds was voted on to create critical programs which support tobacco education and Prevention and Tobacco related disease research by allowing the BOE to continue to divert funding tobacco excise tax revenue to cover the shortfall we deplete the life-saving programs that for of critical funding by revising this program and supporting SB 11 a b 11 sorry we are able to cover the cost without having to pillage other programs thank you thank you additional witnesses in support mr. chairman members Terry Brennan on behalf of SEIU California in support Megan all right on behalf of the California Dental Association and support Vanessa Hina on behalf of the California Society of Anesthesiologists and support Tim Madame herbs in the California Chapter of the American College of Cardiology in support stated for the Association of Northern California oncologists and the medical oncology Association of Southern California in support the Jerry Chaffee representing the California chronic care coalition in support Lydia borne representing American Academy of Pediatrics in support Jasmine Gordon on behalf of the California black health network in support Justin Garrett with the March of Dimes in support Kimberly Chen with the California pan-ethnic Health Network in support Lindsay Freitas with the American Lung Association in California in support Sean south of the California primary care association and support so I assume on behalf of Health Access California in support polizia centers with the California Medical Association in support Matt Reed on behalf of breathe California in the Breathe California affiliates in support dr.

7 which is about smoking in the workplace California has led the nation or had led the nation in its laws that protect its citizens from secondhand smoke but unfortunately a lot of those laws had left open some loopholes other states are getting ahead of us in our ability to protect against secondhand smoke what this bill does is close some of those loopholes and ensure that more workplaces in California will be smoke-free I do have witnesses in support and I ask for your aye vote Thank You mr. chair and members Kelly haft on behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association really excited about this bill that would eliminate loopholes in current law that allow for smoking in the workplace there is overwhelming scientific evidence that secondhand smoke is a direct cause of heart disease the number one killer for both men and women in California in the nation the US Surgeon General support in 2006 found that even brief exposure to secondhand smoke can have an immediate out of adverse effect on the cardiovascular system smoking cost the state of California twenty three billion dollars a year in both health costs and lost productivity with three and a half billion dollars directly linked to medical alone in addition to the economic burden of smoking there is a human cost to last year 43,000 Californians lost their lives to smoking and tobacco related illness and disease once the nation's leader in protecting workers from the deadly effects of secondhand smoke California has fallen behind the national standards set by the CDC and is not considered a 100 percent smoke-free state 26 other states and the District of Columbia provide greater smoke secondhand smoke protection in the workplace in California in fact one in seven workers report being exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace in California low-income workers young adults and Latinos are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at work exposure to secondhand smoke should not be a condition of employment it is time for California to catch up with the rest of the nation every Californian deserves to work in a healthy environment and should not have to make a choice between a good health or good job we have the opportunity to do that today and I respectfully urge your aye vote thank Thank You additional witnesses in support chairman Ponte and members Terry Brennan on behalf of SEIU California the argument is simple here no one should have to as a condition of employment risk their health and risk their life we work with a lot of Public Safety folks who do it knowingly the average worker shouldn't have to suffer the same fate so we are drive out on the bill mr. chairmembers Sara flocks Micallef or Nia Labor Federation we help to enact restrictions on workplace smoking in 1994 now is the time to close the loopholes in that original law so that we protect worker health and safety we urge your aye vote thank you Thank You additional witnesses in support David fort for the medical oncology Association of Southern California and the association of Northern California oncologists in support Tim Maddon representing the California Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians in support that's the Armstrong with the county health executives in support Vanessa here on behalf of California Society of Anesthesiologists here in support the cherry cheffy representing California chronic care Coalition in support Meghan all red representing the California Dental Association in support so I assume on behalf of Health Access California and support Lindsay Freitas American Lung Association in California and support Gregory Kramer from Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and support Kimberly Chen with the California pan-ethnic Health Network in support Alesia Sanchez with the California Medical Association in support video born American Academy of Pediatrics and support Justin Garrett with the March of Dimes in support Sean South with the California Primary Care Association in support Jasmine Gordon on behalf of the California block Health Network in support Matt Reed on behalf of breathe California in the breath California affiliates and support brainy Roberts for the Health Officers Association of California in support Tim Gibbs American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and support dr. Donald Lyman from the california academy of preventive medicine and support thank you see no additional witnesses in support witnesses in opposition please come forward let's make some space for our witnesses in opposition please mr. chairman and members James Jack on behalf of the cigar Association of America the national trade association representing the cigar manufacturing industry our association has an oppose unless amended position on this bill we are asking for a relatively minor amendment to exclude the prohibition of smoking in cigar retailers and private cigar lounges oftentimes cigar smokers prefer not to smoke at home because they do not want to expose their families or their children to secondhand smoke cigar lounges provide an environment for cigar enthusiasts where they can enjoy each other's company in a venue that non-smokers do not frequent and where minors are not allowed the SCAR Association of America has no quarrel with the remainder of the prohibitions in this bill but would ask for the author's consideration and the Committees of that minor amendment in order to remove our opposition thank you good afternoon again my name is gregory connelly with the nonprofit the american vaping association now that you have passed through the earlier tobacco bill making the use of smoke free vapor products smoking it is critical that the amendment that the person from the cigar association advocated for also be passed because vape shops all throughout california if this amendment is not put in would be unable to allow people to sample products to see what flavor will help them get off of cigarettes to test the product to see exactly how they work to troubleshoot to get problems done by trained employees that will all go away if that amendment is not put in I also want to speak to one of the exemptions that you're removing seems especially silly in the context of vapor products which is the only thing that we are speaking on banquet rooms I was just at an event ECC it was called in Pomona with thousands of vapors with exhibiting vapor products a restricted etc that event is now banned in California if the prior bill goes through but we had a private function afterwards for about 50 people 75 people and vaping was allowed in the banquet room of the hotel that will no longer be the case if this exemption passes I would also urge you in California there's an exemption if this amendment is put in for retail and wholesale tobacco outlets it is very unclear because California's never really had a cigarette manufacturing industry as far as I know vaping meanwhile you have possibly hundreds of businesses throughout California they manufacture in professional labs but they do not have retail or wholesale storefronts so the question is if I am a manufacturer and I have made new eliquid in my facility filled with only employees who vape do I then have to step outside to try the product to determine if that's something that I want to make it makes no sense it's very unclear so you have these manufacturing facilities they should be welcome they are providing good jobs some of these people 50 75 people they employ with health care but you may send the people that are creating the actual doing the actual manufacturing outside to do product testing it just doesn't make sense and it may make sense for cigarettes because they would harm the employees around them but with vapor products especially if you put in something about ventilation there's no harm in a manufacturing facility to be able to use them and thank you for your time Thank You additional witnesses in opposition I strongly oppose my name is Kirsten sure hole from bourbon California representing great Verity and we strongly oppose this bill

chair and members this bill essentially raises the legal minimum age for smoking from 18 to 21 we can talk statistics all day long on this issue but I want to talk a bit about my personal experience as a health care provider and the tol tobacco took on the lives of the people who entrusted me to their care in 27 years of practice as a dentist I never had a patient say to me boy am I glad I started smoking indeed nationwide 90% of smokers wish they had never started I saw oral disease progressed before my eyes I saw tooth loss yelling of teeth significant decay gum disease and yes oral cancer in addition to nicotine being a highly addictive substance the continued constriction it causes blood vessels in the oral cavity is what leads to poor circulation gum disease and ultimately the loss of teeth I want to spend just a minute on smokeless tobacco which is common among youth particularly in the more rural areas of our state and a district that I represent the constant irritation to the area of the mouth where the wad of tobacco is placed can result in permanent damage to gum tissue precancerous tissue changes an oral cancer that can invade the bone injured gums pull away from the teeth exposing root surfaces and leaving teeth susceptible to decay receding gums and the erosion of bone the supports leads to tooth loss seeing young people whose oral health is being destroyed by tobacco is tragic and knowing that continued use will at a minimum lead to thousands of dollars a restorative dental care potential disfigurement due to bone loss at worst tobacco leads to oral and systemic cancers requiring treatments in the tens of thousands or hundreds of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars and that that treatment leaves an impact on a person's quality of life ironically my younger patients who had been educated about the problems related smokeless tobacco often insisted on her oral cancer exam and we routinely did for all of our patients even with their health concerns the addiction is so strong it's really really difficult for them to stop but back to smoking I saw patients who were good friends fight cancer heart disease emphysema emphysema and lose their battle to stop smoking the addiction is so great that many of them even during radiation chemotherapy just can't quit and it's really painful to watch we know what it's a killer tobacco products are we know how the industry works to attract the next generation of victims through advertising product making manipulation and enhancement yet for years we have been reluctant to say enough let's do something productive to stem the Sun stem the tide and save millions of lives in the future you may hear from witnesses that this infringes on people's right to choose what they do to their bodies I see it just delays the timeframe a bit and maybe just maybe that person won't make a bad decision and if they do they will still have a life time to enjoy the deadly products and the adverse and health impacts that will come with them in the 1970s we lowered the drinking age from 21 to 18 we found as a result that motor vehicle accidents of fatalities skyrocketed in this age group eventually over many years under the threat of loss of federal highway hunt funding gradually this moved back to 21 and we saved lives this is precedent this this precedent for adjusting an age to accomplish strong public health objectives is before us the momentum is surging across the nation New York City and Hawaii have both passed laws to restrict access to tobacco and nicotine products before 21 as mayor my hometown of Healdsburg we were the first in California to raise the age to purchased tobacco and 12 to 21 others have followed including recently Santa Clara County in July 2015 the CDC released a study that concludes that 75% of adults favor raising the tobacco age to 21 and that includes 70% of smokers the small city of Needham Massachusetts took a bold move in 2005 and restricted the sale of tobacco products before the age 21 while many thought it was a symbolic effort the results over the next few years surprised people over the next five years in the twenty nine suburb surrounding Boston there was a slight decrease in the number and the amount of teen smoking but in Needham Massachusetts it dropped by 50% experts attribute this decreased the loss of social sources teen smoking is enabled by older teens buying for the younger raising the age to 21 works 21 year olds are much less likely than 18 year olds to buy tobacco products for their 14 year old friends I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to present this bill I'm here with me today our Beverly Mei with tobacco free kids and dr. Don Lyman with the California Academy of preventive medicine in support of the bill California's efforts to reduce tobacco use can you press the button on your mic it's on it's on can you hear now okay yes much better thank you okay the campaign for tobacco-free kids as a nation largest non-profit non-governmental advocacy solely devoted to reducing tobacco use tobacco remains the nation's number one preventable cause of premature death and disease raising the legal age for the sale of tobacco products to 21 complements California's current tobacco prevention and control efforts and is an important step that will protect youth and young adults from the unrelenting efforts of the tobacco industry to a dick them to a product that will kill one in three of them earlier this year the Institute of Medicine one of the most prestigious scientific authorities in the world concluded that raising the tobacco age to 21 will have a substantial positive impact on public health and save lives the IOM found that raising the tobacco age will significantly reduce the number of adolescents and young adults who start smoking reduce smoking cause dust and immediately improve the health of adolescents young adults young mothers who would be charged from smoking as well as their children raising the tobacco age is popular with the public as was mentioned before by the sponsor by a poll that was or a study that was released by the Centers for Disease Control raising the age will help protect our youth from a lifetime of addiction to a deadly progress product 95% of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21 and about 80% first try their first cigarette before age 18 I think it's really important a couple things I want to cover in my last minute here is we talked about the military the minimum age and military service does not equate to readiness to enlist in a lifetime of nicotine addiction tobacco is bad for military preparedness and the Department of Defense has stepped up efforts to help service members quit in addition to harming troops health tobacco use is a huge financial drain on the DoD and VA health care systems the og spends more than 1.6 billion dollars each year on tobacco related medical care I will end by saying it's important to remember that the age 18 is not the age of majority for everything from buying alcohol to running for certain political offices and so on the appropriate age for various activity is based on evaluating risk and other factors tobacco use is addictive it's deadly activity and most people never make that choice to smoke as an adult the industry targets young people and that is who start smoking the policy will help protect them we urge swift passage thank you very much thank you mr. chairman members good afternoon I'm dr. Donald Lyman I'm here representing the California Academy of preventive medicine which is in support of the statute I recently retired from the Department of Public Health State's Department of Public Health where I ran the tobacco control program this is a very successful program we have cut the adult smoking rate by 50% about 22% down to about 11 and 12 percent we've also cut the amount of tobacco consumed by about 80 percent it's it's just wonderful concurrently 25 years later we have cut the lung cancer rate in California by about 25 percent that's spectacular this is like a vaccine against cancer it's very nice now in the statute which authorizes this program don't think of the vaccine bono though don't go there now in the statute for this program you have required us to reduce the adult smoking rate to 7% we're now at 11 to 12 percent and we're heading that way but we've run into a big problem it's the tobacco industry they have targeted this age group 18 to 21 for a high profile attention and they've done that for a reason then you've heard it they know this is the highest risk population for addiction if they try them much higher frequency of people go on to addiction the other is that this is the group which supplies tobacco to their younger friends the teenagers where we don't want this stuff to go so weird a head-to-head with the tobacco industry and we need your help and this is part of that help so I urge a yes vote thank you thank you additional witnesses in support Whitney Stanford on behalf of first 5 California and the first 5 Association in

members my name is Pete Conaty I'm retired Army officer and spent 21 years in the Army a tour in Vietnam or I spent a lot of time trying to stomp out or stop our servicemen from using marijuana so they could remain alert so this is an interesting journey I represent the American Legion the American Veterans the Vietnam Veterans of America the Military Officers Association the United's the United States Army the fleet reserve Association the Military Order of the Purple Heart and the Jewish War veterans and we are posed in as legislation for reasons stated in the analysis but I'm old enough to remember when there were only about two states where our servicemen and women had could be vote at age 18 all other states were 21 and the movement during the Vietnam War was if you're old enough to fight and die for your country you ought to have a say in who we elect and so every state has passed legislation lowering the voting age to 18 but now we're going to take that right away from our military forces in the state of California and raise the age to 21 California has more active duty military reservists and National Guard than any other state and they have their two here and contrary to previous testimony being in the military is more dangerous to your health than smoking so these people are adults that are willing to put their life on the line for their country and they ought to be able to go buy a pack of cigarettes if they want to thank you good afternoon chair and distinguished members of the committee again this will be the last time you'll hear from me today my name is gregory connelly on behalf of the american vaping association i'd like to bring something to your attention as a resident of new jersey which is one of the i believe four states that have that had previously raised the age to buy tobacco to 19 which i think is reasonable and does do an effective job at keeping tobacco out of high schools i turn 19 approximately a couple may believe a couple weeks before the law went into effect so I was 19 and I could legally buy cigarettes meanwhile my friends who were 18 who let's say on Monday they could go into the store and legally purchase cigarettes tobacco e-cigarettes whatever they wished the next day all of a sudden it became a crime for someone to sell them a tobacco product I would strongly encourage you to at least if you're going to do is I'm not going to be able to change your minds I recognize that but grandfathering in existing legal smokers you hear these groups that talk about how the reason why these 18 year olds and 19 year olds are smoking is because they've been targeted and they've been targeted for addiction well have some sympathy for the 18 19 and 20 year olds they are going to have to go to their friends and they're going to have to put their friends in a very precarious legal position to purchase and acquire tobacco for them not all and I don't believe even a majority of 18 19 and 20 year old smokers will quit if this law goes into effect all they will be doing is making criminals out of their friends and I'd like to add this bill I believe due to the earlier definition change and another bill would include non nicotine paper products I think it stretches the imagination to say that servicemen and women or even me when I was 20 could not purchase a vapor product I will show you this I would pass it around this is tobacco free snuff nicotine free snuff it comes in cherry it is essentially you could say that it's a training product to use actual snuff I'd like to move the bill it will remain available to youth under this bill but no nicotine vapor products will not I'll repeat since you look a little confused non nicotine vapor products nick of a ver products that do not contain nicotine will be illegal to those under 21 meanwhile imitations snuff smokeless tobacco products that don't actually contain tobacco they are designed to look and feel and taste just like tobacco 1819 1716 doesn't matter your age you can keep buying it but if you want to buy a vapor product possibly to quit smoking even if it doesn't contain nicotine well until you're legal to drink you can't buy it I don't think that makes sense and I would really urge grandfathering in and perhaps looking to the non nicotine issue thank you thank you Sara additional witnesses in opposition seeing none Assemblymember Bonilla questions and comments from members so as it looks like there's a few members of the public that weren't quite ready to state their opposition so why don't you go ahead and line up and as that's happening we can entertain a second to mr. Levine's motion we have a second from assembly member stone thank you no Sara friend San Jose California opposed my name is Matthew Villarreal from Los Angeles California and I oppose ed wolf this changes a b6 which you said it would not change the adult age and now it will with this bill so you're now changing what you said you wouldn't do what we're doing here or you're stating your name your organization or your city and your position that's it please representing their name from Burbank California and we strongly oppose this bill Thank You Robin panic Elif Vallejo LLC and I oppose this bill Jonathan Thomas with flawless manufacturing distribution strongly opposed John Kavanagh from vaping industries Costa Mesa strongly opposed Chris capo vaping industries Costa Mesa strongly opposed Daniel Salazar army event I strongly oppose James Lewis small business owner opposed Ryan's in ski and I'm California strongly opposed bravo seus Fullerton California and I strongly oppose rich Kelly bill and vapors I strongly oppose Natalie Gomez San Jose I strongly oppose Lisa kill at Santa Fe Springs California villain vapors I strongly oppose James strong to such a California ECC VPX I strongly oppose Kyle Ryan San Jose California I strongly oppose Bobby Williams representing 493 out of Rocklin California I strongly oppose Josh will curb you with faux tastic vapors opposed Joshua french-fry Celie California I oppose mark rodriguez rizal california post georgia Rosco still serving in the military and I strongly oppose thank you see no additional witnesses in opposition Assemblymember Bonilla I'm I noticed in the analysis the opposition about the military and isn't true that on military bases servicemen can drink wine and beer if there is that correct if they're not to be for their 21 no that is not correct to the drinking age on military basis is 21 but perhaps we will try and change that next year well that's interesting because I because I was thinking we you know looking at the consistency if that was the case but it isn't the case I mean I I certainly understand the frustration in that environment around the yeah age being 21 I think it's something that's worth looking at I understand I support the bill I understand all the risks but when we start talking about risk and we're talking about our young men and women serving in the military there's a little irony there that I think you know makes it makes it a more difficult discussion so I I think that I support the bill but I think it's something we really do need need to look at it's a it's an exception that I think is understandable to make thank you any other members with questions or comments thank you seeing none we have a motion we have a second doctor what would you like to close yeah I just like to address the the issue around military service because it's come up a couple different ways so indeed we can't send a person to Ward 18 and but that in my mind doesn't mean that we we should shouldn't be for trying to protect them in other ways many of my patients who were the heaviest smokers were often veterans and maybe that's because it was so much easier and cheaper to get tobacco products in the military than it is anywhere else I love my country I'd do anything for it I protect it and including going to war myself so that my son wouldn't have to go who's nineteen years old and if I could change the age of military service I'd do that too but I can't do that those eligible for military service cannot legally drink until you're 21 years old you can't rent a car until you're 25 so what does that tell you about how the insurance industry assesses risk I and and a person's judgment and their in their age of maturity so so I I'm you know I don't buy it I think that you know unfortunately the a lot of the veterans that I have seen that been the heaviest smokers have also had the heaviest health impacts and we quite frankly are paying for all of that so why wouldn't we want to help curb that habit why wouldn't we want to protect our children from this deadly product and so I I think the time to act is now let's move this policy forward let's save lives and let's save the needless suffering let's say the state of California a lot of money in the long run so I ask for your aye vote thank you for your attention thank you dr. wood we have a motion we have a second the motion is due pass to finance Madam Secretary please call the roll Bonta aye I mean Cheyne Baker Baker no Bonilla Bonilla aye Campos Campos aye Garcia Levine Levine aye maze maze no Santiago Santiago aye steinorth stein North no Stone stone aye Thurmond Thurmond aye would I would I the bill passes with a vote of 8 to 3 thank you dr. Whitaker we'll go to our final bill of this hearing item number 4 ABX to 9 Thurmond Assemblymember Thurmond tobacco use programs whenever you're ready Assemblymember Thurmond Thank You mr. chair and members and let me start by saying that I accept the amendments suggested on page 5 of the committee analysis it's my honor to present a B 2 X 9 the tobacco free schools measure we spent the afternoon talking about a central team keeping tobacco out of the hands of young people from being used by young people and from having our young people become addicted to tobacco use I can't think of a place more important than our schools to make sure that we drive home that message and this bill would require all of our schools to maintain tobacco-free campuses for students and for those who work on or who visit our campuses we have no statewide prohibition against smoking on k12 school campuses but yet we do have funding that was passed by Prop 99 by the voters in 1988 that provides funding to school districts and local education associations to be able to provide and enforce tobacco-free campus policies sadly less than 50 percent of local education agencies receive grants and are required to be tobacco-free but we've seen that schools that consistently force tobacco-free policies have shown decrease rates of smoking amongst their students by requiring all le A's to become a hundred percent tobacco-free and by including smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes a v2x nine will help ensure that schools protect students and those who work with our students on our campus while reducing tobacco use among our youth thank you and I respectfully request an aye vote we have three witnesses here today to help us with our message and discussion okay three minutes will be two minutes each thank you good afternoon mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Tammy Silveira I'm a program specialist specialist excuse me with the Elk Grove Unified School District and I coordinate our districts tobacco use prevention education program this program has been in place in Elk Grove for well over 15 years the program provides the funding base that allows us to provide students comprehensive tobacco prevention education numerous opportunities for students to take the lead as tobacco free advocates in their schools and in their community and on campus intervention services for students who are struggling with tobacco use according to our California Healthy Kids survey in 2013 the long-standing work of the Elk Grove Unified School District Program has contributed to a very low 2% usage rate for cigarettes in the seventh and ninth grade and a four percent usage rate in the 11th grade tobacco-free campus policies are integral in the success of an overall tobacco prevention program prohibiting the use of any kind of tobacco or nicotine products on school grounds and during any school function demonstrates our commitment to keeping children tobacco-free and providing them a healthy place to learn and grow the benefits of tobacco prevention programming and tobacco-free campus policies also has a ripple effect because the skills that students learn and the messages they receive to combat the pressures of smoking extend to other critical health choices that they need to make as youth and young adults while California's made great strides its tobacco use prevention efforts we cannot ever consider this task complete every new generation of young people needs to receive this level of education and should allowed to learn and grow in a smoke-free environment I strongly encourage your support thank you thank you we have motion in a second for the bail Alesia Sanchez representing the California Medical Association the author and ms Silveira have done a good job of explaining the importance of tobacco's free schools I would just add that when I talk with people about this bill it creates a bit of cognitive dissonance because most people assume that schools are already tobacco 100% tobacco free when in fact we know that they're not and the other thing that I would note is that universally when we talk about tobacco control we hear that there we need to have a strong educational component and the example that schools provide in having 100% tobacco-free campuses is a major component of that education for youth and so we urge your support for this legislation thank you I will be very quick Lindsay Freitas with the Lung Association I believe these two ladies covered everything so I just urge your support thank you Thank You additional

nn61dLsXuJk,CA,04-17-2013,"the rules I believe a couple of announcements senator pavley will not be in attendance today we have two items on our proposed consent calendar file item number one SB three five seven Korea elective and then we've got file item number ten SB eight one six which is a Health Committee bill which is unconsented well also I anticipate we might have a issue or an area or a bill that might have a long hearing or a lot of testimony so what I'm going to ask that everyone be presenting today that we do three individuals on the support spore side three individuals on the opposition side we're gonna do roughly around three minutes for each individual after that that anyone who would like to take a position that they just very briefly state their name and their position and then we're gonna do that for this hearing so we're gonna start off with item number 3 SB 588 Emerson medical records reproduction fees Thank You senator Hernandez Senate bill 558 updates to medical records pricing statutes related to attorneys request for medical records that have been in place since the 1980s to date California has one of the most antiquated and convoluted medical records reproduction and pricing laws in the country with the advance at advent of electronic medical records and the enactment of HIPAA it is even more important that our laws be modernized to reflect these changes due to HIPAA and state privacy laws the release of information is much more complex than simply making copies of medical records in fact there's a 32 step process that must be followed to ensure that privacy and confidentiality is upheld considering this painstaking process this bill tries to bring the fees in more in line with the task at hand ask for your aye vote do you speak further on this measure as Michael Hawkins and counsel and director of government relations Kyle Probst of Health's post mr. chair and members Mike here on behalf of Health Port I will make one brief comment and then turn it over to Kyle pros for more detailed comment one comment I would like to make is that the pricing that was mentioned by the senator goes back almost thirty years but what what is as significant when this legislation was originally enacted there was certainly no medical records that were electronic maybe not even the contemplation of that and so the statute is completely silent on electronic medical records how they are handled how they are copied and how the confidentiality is maintained so with that I will say that on behalf of Health Port here to support the bill and I'll turn it over to Kyle Probst thank you Thank You chairman and committee members for hearing the Senate bill 588 today my name is Kyle Probst and again I am the counsel on director of government relations for health port technologies we are a release of medical information company that is operating nationwide and in California as well and we have concerns because Senate bill 588 does address two sections that are fundamental to our business section 11 58 of the California evidence code in section 15 63 section 11 58 is important to the release of medical information because it deals specifically with attorney requests or their authorized representative requests for patient medical records before the filing of a lawsuit now it's not just the copying of those records there's also an access provision to that and what happens is that typically an attorney could hire a photocopying industry to come in and access those records for them the problem we have is that with the advent of electronic health records and now the mandate from the federal level to have electronic health records that you have difficulty in establishing how you can allow access to a record without actually providing a physical copy so what we tried to do in Senate bill 588 is address those issues and allow a provision where we could allow some form of an acts to a actual printed copy or the provider can allow access to the electronic health record we also keep in place the copying provisions but then we tried to adopt increased fees for those services like you've heard already these fees have not been addressed since 1986 and are grossly outdated currently if you were to ask for copies under that statute it's at 10 cents a page for an attorney request the national average for an attorney request across the country in the 50 states is 93 cents a page for the first page so you're looking at an 83 cent difference just from the average we've also asked for a base fee for the search and retrieval of those records of $30 and out of the 50 states 32 of them have a base fee and that range is anywhere from five to forty five dollars across the country so we felt $30 was well within the range there's some question I think from the attorneys and other industries saying why do you need this fee in the first place why does it need to be increased and it's for that patient privacy and confidentiality to be protected when you have these records and you're granting access to them or you're providing a copy to an individual you have to review those records review the authorization make sure that those records comply with the authorization make sure that you're dealing with the same individual make sure that you're only providing the records that are the scope of the authorization itself because that's what can be released so that involves a lot of work and process and that's actually what the compensation is for and the fees that we're asking for is instead of the 10 cents a page which sounds like a reasonable copy rate to just say well here's a piece of paper there's actually work involved on the hospital's end and on the ROI end to make sure that these records are HIPAA compliant and that the patient's privacy and confidentiality is being protected this is not a service that the attorneys are providing or that the photocopy industry provides it's one that the providers the medical providers have to provide under HIPAA secondarily this amendment would address section 1563 of the evidence code which deals with the subpoena of medical records so again we're dealing with an attorney request via a subpoena currently the statute 1563 has the same rates for any records that are produced even if they're not medical records so all records are treated the same what we would propose under Senate bill 588 is that the process for subpoenaed records remain the same but that the fees from 11:58 when they're adopted would apply to a medical record that's subpoenaed because the work involved in protecting the patient confidentiality and privacy is the same for a subpoenaed record as it is for one that is requested before the filing of a lawsuit so with that I thank you for your time and I request a a yes vote on this Senate bill 588 thank you very much anyone else like to speak in support state your name and position my name is Victor Rivera and I'm president of integrity document solutions so release of information company in California and Nevada in Arizona mainly in California it's speaking and support correct yes thank you right please state your position I'm Donna Payne I'm co-owner of track star release of information services we work in California and I am here to support this bill thank you my name is Richard Eng corner of tracks our co beliefs of information services and I support this bill thank you anyone else in support any opposition to the measure mr. chairmembers Vanessa Hina with the Western center on law and poverty here to have to regretfully oppose SB 588 which would significantly increase cost for low-income consumers attempting to access their medical records currently if a patient or a patient's representative can get copies of their medical records if that request is made in writing hospitals can impose some charges in providing those records but they have to comply within 15 days or legal aid partners who represent low-income clients around the state need access to health care Social Services benefits in the application process in the appeals process they have traditionally been able to get these records for free of charge given the locally-based relationships that they have with the hospitals around their service area the requirement for increased fees associated with this bill would be a major hardship for low-income clients and their representatives when attempting to access records so that clients can have acts adequate records when applying for benefits like medical or Supplemental Security income or appealing adverse decisions with their health plans these records are necessary when clients are appealing medical decisions that affect their health in serious and immediate ways given the number of Appeals from the seniors and persons with disabilities transition as well as the community based adult services transition consideration must be given to a beneficiary's immediate need for services getting those records in a timely manner so that we can keep beneficiaries safe independent and healthy we're also very concerned with the provision of this bill that would require the Department of Health Care Services to examine the need to further augment fees based on the Consumer Price Index and further that the director of DHCS in his or her sole discretion would be allowed to change fees on that calculation DHCS does have an inherent interest in curbing their costs and additional barriers associated with increased fees can be used as a means of attrition Appeals quite frankly our Legal Services advocates can't afford these charges in this provision neither can their clients funding for legal aid offices as tenuous and most offices in the state of either laid off staff cut hours curbed eligibility for beneficiaries or programming in the past years the records they need to prove a client's case can sometimes be in the hundreds of pages for those reasons we have to oppose SB 588 and not spring thank you before we move on to any more opposition or before we open up to any questions any of the members we have establish a quorum at this time I like to ask the secretary call the roll Hernandez here Hernandez here Anderson Anderson here Belle de Leon dis songyang your dis on you here Monning here Monning here Nielsen Pavley Wolk Wolk here the quorum has been established sorry for the eruption is there anyone else in opposition to the measure any questions or comments from any of the members senator Anderson aye has anyone moved the bill I stepped out first so we literally just established a quorum right now so I'd like to move the bill okay I did have a couple questions with regarding comparing the attorney fees to the hospital fees an understanding that we're moving away from paper claims which I understand are obviously much easier to copy to electronic making sure that no one gets inappropriately the wrong record copying those rec producing those records and then copy them is this equal whether it's an attorney that's kind of charged those and is it going to be the same standards and the same fees that they would get as opposed to the hospitals as well well I'm not sure I completely understand the question because the attorneys the way 11:58 works the attorneys are the ones were being charged for the records that they request so the provider the medical provider or in this case the release of information companies the ones who are charging the attorneys the rates that are in section 11 58 for the production of those records that the attorneys are requesting there isn't anything in the statute regarding what an attorney charges well let's say an attorney would file on behalf of a complaint and then they're gonna go to a provider to get those medical records doesn't the attorney have the right to get to charge those facilities the cost for producing that that record does the attorney have the ability to charge the medical provider yes actually senator the the way it works it's either a hospital a Medical Group a health facility that has the records and there's a copying service or a request of information company like health port that will go into the facility and make the copy of the records it's been the attorney that pays for the copying of the record okay so the attorneys themselves will copy the records no no it's it's an independent copy service or or a service such as such as health for all right thank you any other further questions or comments yes Seneca master church so a follow up on that I share the concerns raised by Western Center but but on the issue of correct me if I'm wrong but as I understand this an attorney representing a patient with that patient authorization currently is able to pursue the patient's medical records and make arrangements for the copying or the transfer those records if this bill were to become law would the attorney still have direct access to a records request of the patient yes they would still have the direct access to those records we did not delete the access provision in Senate bill 588 so they would still have the ability to access the records it's just a matter of how do we do this with an electronic record system because typically the electronic records are stored on a server or they're stored in a cloud in some cases and when you have a system depending on the security within that electronic health record system whoever sitting at that computer could access other records and that's where the potential threat of a HIPAA breach comes in so what we've proposed is that when there's an electronic health record system in place which they're becoming ubiquitous now and are actually mandated within the next several years to be at every provider the medical provider if they don't have a system set up where you can sit at a computer and physically look at it as an attorney or as an agent who's been hired by the attorney that they have the option to print that out for you and just give you the relevant records that are in responsive to the authorization mm-hmm so the concern is giving access to the electronic correct means of accessing the document correct and currently the existing law does not address electronic records at all so there's no guidance at all regarding that aspect and that's what's really caused a lot of confusion in this industry and and I appreciate that because I think we need to address this issue I guess my concern is whether it necessarily then makes the patient either on their own or through a representative seek the services of a independent business to get access to electronic no under HIPPA federal law would prohibit any medical provider from prohibiting access to a patient so they would be prohibited under federal law from that but what we're talking about is the means of that access reckon what you just described a minute ago it sounds as though the attorney making that request from your perspective to protect potential access to other patient records would only be able to secure a printout of the patient record not an electronic record no not necessarily we'd be able to provide a disc we'd be able to provide a USB flash drive something of that nature it doesn't actually have to be on paper we would actually I think as an industry I think everyone at the table would agree if we could go to electronic records and hand them a USB or if we could do through an internet like a web portal for example or if we could send a secure email those are actually preferred methods of delivery within our industry and we would prefer that but what the concern is is that the medical providers may not have the security within or may not have the system set up where an attorney where they're authorized representative could go to the computer in the hospital and look at the record themselves because they may have access to other patient records so what we put prefer is that the choice is left to the medical provider if they can provide that security they can allow that access if not then they'll provide the electronic record or a printout thank you that's helpful Thank You mr. chair and if I may can I dress your other comment about the Western Law Center yes I'd like to point everyone's attention to section 123 110 of the California Health and Safety Code which I think paragraph D actually addresses the the issue of the records for medical program Social Security disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security income statement supplement program for the aged blind and disabled benefits and it actually states that there will be no charge for the request of those records for the first time it has come to my attention today that if we were able to put something into Senate bill 58 we may be able to alleviate that concern saying that this would still be applicable I think that would be very helpful from my point of view and I think my I think we're on to something that needs attention and I don't know that I'm ready to support it today I know it's dual referred to judiciary and if that's something that could be incorporated I think particularly for the population that you identified through that health and safety code or provision it would it would be a significant improvement this measure does not amend that section so that section is already currently yes yes what I read to you is because that's current law but it's not it's not it's not address changed by this in with western center at all like to respond to the comment that was made by the proponents Thank You mr. chair once again Vanessa with the Western center on law and poverty the provision to which he is describing is only for the aged blind and disabled program which is only one aspect of the Medicaid program if we're talking about 1931 be if we're talking about families children doing transitions right now this would not apply to them it only also applies to the first time that records are requested occasionally in our appeals and grievances process this people need records multiple times they might need access to multiple records now we understand the larger problem that the bill is attempting to address and we respect that that we've moved on to electronic medical records I think that there might be some fee waivers available that we can discuss in further amendments but at this point we have to oppose the bill in print so tell me about potential fee waivers that you're looking for carve-outs for that segment of the population and is the proponents willing to address that or or accept that or have a conversation fee waivers I believe have been afforded to low-income clients in judicial cases we would have to go back and do more research on it we understand that the bill might have some more time to work on also with it we would be asking probably for low-income beneficiaries as well as legal services representatives and legal services advocates any other yes let me say that one of the issues from Western Center brought up was on the CPI willing to take that out no not a problem we'll have that discussion in judicial feet waivers and so be more than willing to address that issue okay my understanding and we have no amendments there's no mock-up at this time so this bill will be voted on its merits as we speak but there have been some concerns brought up obviously for individuals who don't have the the means if in the event that they need to access their medical records or in the event it's a electronic that that you'll address it in judicious and they go to the CPI the CPI issue but more importantly to address the fee waiver to address to low-income individuals I believe that if I ever your word that you address that I'll feel comfortable voting on it at this time understanding that if it's not then I have the right to pull the bill back but I understand your concern about individuals who don't have that ability to pay for it so with that I'll recommend an aye vote any other questions or comments senator Monning just before this moves to a vote I'm gonna join the chair in supporting the bill today and and we'll wait and see what progress we've made in judiciary which I also sit on so but look forward to working with the various stakeholders on this Thank You mr. O'Casey no other comments we have a motion and it is motion do pass to judiciary by Senator Anderson it's SP 588 Emerson call the roll Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson aye Anderson aye Belle de Lyon do Sonnier Monning aye Monning aye Nielsen aye Nielsen aye Pavley Wolk Wolk aye that currently has five we will put that on call we have some absent members when they return we will lift that call Senate all right thank you very much yeah at this time we can do the consent calendar we have item number one SB 357 item number 10 SB eight one six do I have a motion so moved senator Wolk we can call the members please Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson Anderson aye Bao de Leon Doosan yay Monning Monning aye Nielsen Nielsen aye Pavley Wolk Wolk aye that currently that current vote count is five we will put that bill on call to the absent members return going in order we are now at file item number six Courbet SB 648 electronic cigarettes restriction of use and advertising thank you very much mr. chair this is as you stated Senate bill six four eight Senate bills Senate bill six four eight seeks to add electronic cigarettes to California's existing smoke-free laws we're working with staff to deal with a technical issue noted on page six of the analysis dealing with the Code section and we're committed to continue to work on that as the bill moves through with your staff electronic cigarettes that also known as ISA Guerette sour battery-powered devices that provide inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized propylene glycol and nicotine mixture through the push of an e-cigarette and they're usually manufactured to resemble traditional cigarettes e-cigarettes are not emission free studies have shown the vaporized substances created create an aerosol of particles that are released into the air and the vapor includes elements that are known to be harmful to health in a study published last month just in March the researchers from the University of California examined the aerosol contents of e-cigarettes they found particles of silver iron aluminum silicate tin chromium and nickel the SiC the researchers noted that concentrations of these metal components were higher than or equal to the corresponding concentrations in conventional cigarette smoke so let me just reread this they found that the concentrations were higher than or equal to the corresponding concentrations in conventional cigarette smoke and that many of the elements identified an e-cigarette vapor cause respiratory distress and disease a growing number of state and local governments have moved to prohibit ecig arete use in public places often under existing our new smoke-free laws Amtrak has banned their use on trains the Navy has banned their use below decks and commercial airlines have banned their usage aboard airplanes the US Department of Transportation is also working on a proposed ban because of concerns about health risks from vapors Senate bill 648 will strengthen our existing smoke-free laws and provide consistent regulation with regard to the use of e-cigarettes with me today I have Alicia Sanchez the legislative advocate for California Medical Association and Lydia borne the legislative advocate for the California black health network to testify in support thank you welcome Alysia Sanchez with the California Medical Association there continue to be significant questions about e-cigarettes including the health risks as Senator Corbett noted as well and their impact on smoking cessation that need to be thoroughly studied and addressed from the California Medical Association's perspective one of the major issues for us is it's complicating the enforcement of our existing smoke-free laws which the CMA was actively supportive of and that they have been those laws have been the foundation of the state success in decreasing tobacco use so you can imagine the confusion that it creates to have someone who is smoking one of these cigarettes in a place where other types of smoking are not allowed in fact I just saw somebody doing it in a hotel the other day and it you know it just is it's jarring and I think it also does really complicate enforcement so we would urge your support for this legislation thank you video borne representing the California black health network we're a 501c3 statewide nonprofit working with local state and federal entities to eliminate health disparities in african-american community our concern primarily is with the likely effect on the african-american community I think we are all aware that smoking rates in California have dropped however when you look at the rates in african-american community they still remain high 18 percent for men 15 percent for women and that rate has remained fairly flat for the last five years we also know in spite of the fact that e cigarettes are are relatively new that there has been almost 100% increase in terms of people using these elect electronic cigarettes and to go along with it with Alicia says I'm a tennis player and on the tennis court I've actually seen people with these cigarettes hanging out of their mouths electronic cigarettes hanging out of their mouths when they play tennis which is rather disconcerting when you think about it according to the FDA they have grave concerns about these these new products and just recently they have said they're in the process process of issuing national regulations so we believe that caution is in order and we we agree that there should not be smoking the electronic cigarettes allowed in non-smoking areas so we're in full support and strong support of SB 648 and ask for your aye vote Thank You anyone else in support of the measure is there any opposition to the measure o to respond at all we have okay that's that's for departments and everybody else and then you go [Music] alright the opposition the three that we'll be presenting please state your name and obviously your position good morning or afternoon chairman Hernandez vice chairman Anderson and members of the committee my name is Gregory Connelly and I serve as the volunteer legislative director for the nonprofit organization the consumer advocates for smoke free alternatives Association known as Casa where the leading us advocate that represents consumers of low risk smoke free alternatives to smoking including vapor products commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes I am here today to encourage you to report unfavorably on Senate bill 648 four years ago SB 648 sponsor senator Corbett attempted to ban the sale of smoke free electronic cigarettes while leaving real cigarettes freely available on the market thankfully Senator Corbett's bill failed to become law had it become law most of the individuals that you see in line today would still be inhaling burning smoke on a daily basis Senator Corbett was wrong on the science four years ago and unfortunately she is still wrong today SB 6 for 8 comes despite a complete lack of evidence showing that electronic cigarette vapor poses a threat to public health bald assertions regarding the unknowns of e-cigarettes are bolide by the science on the subject for example they just brought up the study from the University of California regarding metals found in electronic cigarettes but what they failed to note was that that study found extremely trace levels and there are national and international standards for inhalers for example the Nicorette inhaler does expose even though it is FDA approved it does expose users to the same trace trace levels of lead nickel etc as found in electronic cigarette paper in that study additionally last just in the past month the Journal of tobacco control the top tobacco journal in the nation published a study looking at 13 different e-cigarettes that was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health up to 450 times less chemicals or less constituents of chemicals were found in the e-cigarette vapor as compared to real cigarettes I'd also like to point out one fundamental problem with this bill it is almost guaranteed to never be enforced and I will you could just look at me for about five seconds I will demonstrate now did I just use my electronic cigarette or did I simply hold it up to my lips to simulate the act of active smoking electronic cigarette users can decide whether to release vapor they talked about how it's about airlines have banned them I flew 8 hours to be here today and I it's called stealth vaping I stealth taped on the entire plane right here and there were no issues and coming from New Jersey one of the only two states where the state legislature has banned electronic cigarette use indoors I can confidently tell you that 99% of the California population come five years from now will be completely unaware that this law exists and thus a cigarette use will end up continuing in most places some people have also said that the use of e-cigarettes would normalize smoking cessation well that I would say that do you think that the consumption of Diet Coke normalizes the consumption of sugary beverages the only thing that e cigarette use normalizes is smoking cessation just today I had someone come up to me in the hallway and asked how can I get one of those things and thankfully I was able to tell them that there are at least one e-cigarette store in Sacramento helping hundreds or thousands of people quit smoking every year and closing the use of vapor products poses no threat to bystanders has been found in science does not normalize smoking and in fact only normalizes smoking cessation and if enacted will sir almost certainly never be enforced therefore kasaa urges you to report unfavorably on Senate bill six four eight and I thank you for your time thank you anyone else like to speak in opposition state your name in your position do we have to push the button here yeah it needs to be on I think it's lit already no thank you there we go Darcy McGann I'm from the San Fernando Valley Thank You chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee I'm a chief technology officer for a missile company down in San Fernando senator pavley's district but I'm here to represent my own views and the views of my family actually as a user of electronic cigarettes my wife is a cigarette smoker and when she tried puffing on a disposable e-cigarette alarm bells went off and I had two about just what is this thing that she's trying and it was important because she was doing it a lot so from the scientific perspective things are always a benefit versus of risk so I'm not the expert right but I did do my own research before I allowed her to do it and I wanted to share with you what I found benefit wise it was pretty obvious for she was cutting out about two-thirds of the time that she was puffing on what I knew was bad for her cigarettes you know the state's done a very good job of researching and then in regulating and mitigating the risk of cigarette smoke not only for individuals but for people around them for in the environmental tobacco smoke so she there was two thirds of the cigarette puffing that wasn't going on the 56 and own carcinogens that are in that smoke there's no smoke or ash the house didn't smell there's no cigarette butts waste washing their way to the to the beach all obvious benefits of her doing this and in fact when we were in restaurants now and and at sporting events etc my wife no longer gets up to go and smoke a cigarette instead she can Huff it right there in front of me and in fact I felt good about that so what about the risks you know there's been a lot of studies and there's a lot of data out there but very few conclusions about what all that data means I did look into the FDA report that was mentioned and the recent reports and it really does seem to be a matter of well you'll find something in there the question is is that at a level that's gonna harm people and I and I really think that that's up to somebody like the air research the ARB to decide whether it's a toxic air contaminant or not the nitrous savings that are listed in the reports that were in the syllabus for this this bill in fact are at a level ten times lower than the US government says is harmful to our health so it's not the presence of carcinogens it's not even in fact a question I think of whether they're better than cigarettes everybody agrees they're better than cigarettes the question is are they a risk to everybody else and in in trying to mitigate this risk are we losing a benefit to a four million existing smokers in the California and many more across the nation I think we are I and instead of this bill that an approach where we first use what's already there a be 1807 it establishes a process whereby toxic air contaminants are to be identified by the Air Resources Board it involves the public it involves all the constituents it involves a scientific review panel it's the same process that was used for environmental tobacco smoke in 2001 through 2005 why aren't we using that process now because in fact that very process calls for the evaluation of benefit versus risk and recommends risk mitigation strategies let's instead of worrying about the public in fact being confused by this how about educating the public about the possible benefit and the difference between each cigarettes and regular cigarettes my wife smokes one looks like this it glows blue with the tip there's no confusion about whether this is a cigarette or not and in fact universally there's interest in where did you get that and where can I get it and in fact is it working for you - I am in opposition to this bill I'm an absolute agreement with the work you're doing at trying to protect the public and I ask you to consider other alternatives thank you for the time thank you and next state your name in your position I'm father Jack Kearney I represent the California Association for alcohol and drug educators which is a group that accredits addiction studies programs and over 40 colleges and universities throughout the state of California we also certify camp and trained counselors so we represent the highest level of possible of addiction counselor certification and professionalism state of California in treating addiction we have over 7,000 members that are college professors like myself or students or counselors we have taken a public position in favor of using electronic cigarettes we have done so because they work they work they help smokers this bill which is very well intentioned is probably really gonna make the tobacco companies very happy and the pharmaceutical company is very happy because it's gonna keep people smoking instead of getting off of smoking electronic cigarettes we've already seen in treatment centers results up to 50 to 80 percent of the hardest core smokers in the world which are drug addicts quitting and giving up tobacco and cigarettes because of these wonderful little machines which really don't all look like cigarettes in fact here's a the new priest model you can see it's all black with a little bit of white collar so as a college professor who teaches pharmacology I of course have to study these things presented to my students most of the studies that are used in support of this bill I have my first year students tear apart is junk science because that's what most of them are we need a lot more good science to go to study electronic cigarettes but the clear preponderance of evidence says that overwhelmingly these things are 99 times safer than regular tobacco cigarettes not perfect but 99 times safer the only people using them are smokers who - who are trying to quit so this to punish them to punish them with a bill like this and labeling them and forcing them back outside with the smokers and which was going to set them up for relapse and declaring it a public health hazard we should be having bake sales and car washes to raise money to hand these things out not try and take them away from people so I urge this committee which has in the past shown such graciousness towards people who suffer with addiction to continue that by opposing this bill and and trying really to help thank you thank you and I believe we have one more that's gonna be speaking in opposition before we move to the crowd over here to my left Thank You mr. chair I appreciate your consideration my name is Tracey Nicolas body I'm speaking in opposition to SB 648 and on my own I was a California state police officer from the 1980s through the merge with the CHP in 1994 I was injured in the line of duty and therefore my career over I served under three governors and I vowed to take a bullet for all of you or for the governor also for any citizen being unjustly treated and harmed this is one bullet I cannot take for anyone I also was married to the chief lobbyist for the CCPOA so I saw a lot of stuff going on in here yet never once in all those years have I come before the legislature because I never felt this strongly about any bill this is a very important bill I'm the mother of three beautiful sons and what happened is my 25 year old who I adore as I'm sure you adore your children with smoking a pack of Marlboros a day he was newly married and she had tried many times to quit smoking with no success I wanted to help him so I did my research and I researched these cigarettes and vaping after educating myself I came to the conclusion this is a far healthier alternative no secondhand smoke no stink no chemicals no fire and again as a police officer seeing people flick cigarettes out the window falling in their lap a lot of danger goes along with smoking in fact the vapor is so safe that when I took my granddaughter to Disney on Ice recently they were puffing it out it's the exact same use that they do in fog machines it's the same chemicals used that we are using in our vaping and not one person keeled over dead except a wicked witch who basically had it coming anyway frankly I was a social smoker I like nicotine it calms me down fact I'd really like to smoke right now but um it's good for me no not really it's not good for me at all but neither is bacon or caffeine or sugar and I like those two and God help the person who comes between me and chocolate but besides that since my son and I started using these products we haven't touched a cigarette I haven't had a desire to touch a cigarette which is remarkable and and neither has he my husband has switched and also within a three-month period 12 of my friends have switched over to e-cigarettes and actually I just met one in the hall that a fellow I know who also switched over and I didn't even know about it because they see it and they're like wow we weren't you smoking yeah I was smoking and they want that they want to be healthy they want an alternative to cigarettes I feel this bill is being rushed through without being able to receive correct information considering that no one has been harmed from vaping to date we shouldn't be in such a big hurry to pass this bill I ask that we not be too hasty we're potentially in the presence of something quite amazing and remarkable something that will truly help Californians become smoke-free California has led the way for many states and for that matter the world and don't think for a minute that we're not being closely watched on this one we're about to set a precedence by voting on something that could save future generations from having to watch Debbie and her tracheotomy on TV or seeing photos of black lungs on cigarette packages which frankly don't work they're just kind of disgusting we can also save millions from unnecessary illness and death my children and grandchildren and your children and grandchildren I have a constitutional right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness America shows we're innovators and pioneers and we're the land of the free and the home of the brave I am a pioneer and I'm courageous and I'm speaking to you as an American citizen and for the people who follow me so that they may have the opportunity to be freed from the horrors of cigarettes as we have this bill not only denies me such freedom as to vape in my own home but punishes me by forcing me to stand among smokers inhaling secondhand smoke and tempting me back into the bondage I have just broken free from this bill punishes those of us who are doing exactly what this committee is trying to accomplish we are quitting and we're helping others to quit the community of vapours I've come to know are responsible and self-governing every one of us wants safety standardization and many companies are spearheading this already these are creative minds and health conscious citizens building something wonderful don't knock it down before you see the possibilities it's far easier to wait than to go backwards once the bill is passed I ask that this committee be careful to not throw the baby out with the bathwater because this is a pretty awesome baby and I pray that you vote no on this bill thank you thank you as I mentioned I had asked for originally three individuals to speak at three minutes every one of you went above three minutes but I was trying to be respectful because I understand that you're very passionate but more importantly you want to get your message out reason why I went allowed the fourth is because I know you sent in a note and I thought you were going to be one of the original three so with that with respect for time and I think that each one of the individuals have covered all of the issues with regard to safety the the merits of the issue I will need to extend the same courtesy to the support if they have any additional testimony they'd like to present we can do that after the opposition in all fairness but in but I think what I like to ask is everyone from here on out if you can just please state your name and your position on the bill it would be appreciated I believe we have a microphone these sergeant's will give you one and then we can proceed from this point but thank you Thank You mr. chair I actually do have one viewpoint that wasn't covered I represent the retailers I won't take more than 30 seconds my name is Jim root and versus the consumer perspective on this I wanted to bring something to your attention I'm not a smoker and I've never have been my position is actually to support the spirit of the bill but not the way it's currently written the way it's written it's being handled backwards by trying to regulate this product before studies are completed it could have some very unintended consequences you open the door for manufacturers and retailers to create loopholes or just to call the product something else to circumvent the law this would also undermine this would undermine the ultimate goal of the legislation not to mention the possibility of litigation that can arise from a law that is incomplete so sir I think what we'll do is we'll leave it at that I've been more than fair I've been more than generous in the amount of time so if you can just please state your name and then the position thank you Jim root and I opposed thank you miss bill thank you very much my name is Larry Ross from Carmichael I also oppose the position thank you very much sir my name is Todd Lipson Contra Costa County and I oppose SB 648 my name is Bryan Stephan from Rocklin California and I oppose the bill Eric

I oppose this bill Blaine Davis California State University Sacramento student advisor and instructor I oppose this bill Jim batty from here from Orangeville Sacramento County I oppose this bill with the supporters at all would like to say anything because you have some time left or would you like your the author to make it in a closing statement okay any questions or comments from any of the members Center money I thank you mr. chair and I want to thank the author for bringing this forward we've talked some before today's hearing I think some of the concerns voiced by opponents miss one of the points which this doesn't prohibit the product it seeks to regulate the product that said I'm concerned of the regulation potentially having some unintended consequences and so two areas of concern I have as currently drafted somebody who's a renter in an apartment building in the apartment building prohibits smoking of regular tobacco products would they be prohibited under this bill from using an electronic device in their own apartment or potentially face eviction and then the second area of concern relates to a patient in a hospital who has an addiction to smoking tobacco products and to minimize the impacts of not being able to smoke in a hospital setting with this prohibit using an electronic device under some controlled circumstance in a medical setting I mean thank you very much senator Monning and thank you for pointing out the that this bill does not ban the use of e-cigarettes and that I will speak a little bit more on in my closing and we had did have an opportunity to talk this bill would regulate e-cigarettes the same way we regulate cigarettes today so does true there are a list of laws on our books which currently restrict the use of cigarettes and you correctly pointed out that that includes in some cases the prohibition from using smoking cigarettes in apartments in the typical scenario with regard to cigarettes a tenant would know in entering a lease that they would be prohibited so there would have to be some sort of agreement that being said obviously there are smokers who currently live in apartments and we would have to be concerned about that situation for those individuals after having an opportunity to talk to you about that I think it does make sense to take a look at that part of the the bill I'm not interested in repealing the prohibit probation prohibitions of cigarette smoking in apartments but I think it might make sense to look at I don't want to use the word exempting yet but to look at a way to allow for e-cigarettes to be used in spaces where they're not likely going to impact others the primary goal behind this bill is to protect others from the effects of the vapor I cited a study there are concerns nicotine is very addictive the various elements chemicals metals whatever you want to call them that are in the vapor of e-cigarettes can impact the health of others however I would be glad to work with you on this issue of smoking someplace in a non you know public setting and that would include hospitals we'd have to bring in the Hospital Association too because I'm sure they'd some thoughts and concerns well the hospital snare clinics a little trickier because that is a public environment but I I know this is dual referred to judiciary and with your commitment to work on those issues I will be supportive today but withhold a final vote in Judiciary Committee based on the progress we might make on this but I appreciate your attention administer to those issues because again I think that I'm not convinced of the public health impacts at this stage of the vapor but I know you've cited a study I'd like to do a little more research on that but I think if if if these products provide a vehicle to help people get off smoking products there may be a public health benefit of that so I think in terms of regulation we do have to be careful to allow people that transition in particularly in their own home their own apartment that might be owned by somebody else I look forward to working with you on that issue thank you mister I'm glad to work on it any other comments or questions from any of the members I have a couple comments and then a statement and then I'll tell you what my position is and what my recommendation would be to the committee senator Monning brought up some good points and I know you and I spoke that your goal was to make sure that there was no public harm with these put this particular product I definitely believe that individuals who are either rental or doing it within the confines of their home own home there should be some type of mechanism to protect them to allow them to do it because now that Connors your argument with regard to the public being at risk so if you have that commitment obviously we're gonna be voting with no amendments I also would like to ask that you work with Senator Monning and that you keep me informed with regard to how that's and I don't know how you would address the hospital situation but I think that's something that's up for discussion at least you know I was conflicted from the standpoint of what is the best public policy and I have seen the documents but more importantly these studies and I steer questionable so I find them but my position has to kind of always lean towards the side of overall public safety and you know it is a I was kind of torn but I'm willing to support the bill because I understand the importance that it is to you as the author and what I would ask is that you continue to give me additional information more importantly additional information on the efficacy and the study and boil and the the toxicity of the product to the public okay and with that did you have a comment senator Nielsen I would just offer now sorry I missed the most recent testimony but I have studied the bill and I do find merit in the general premise but I feel there's some compelling need for some substantial change and I'm just a little reluctant always to vote in committee there was something I'm not totally comfortable enough with so I wrote no today but I thank the author for her willingness to work on it and may different thing when I get to see it in the floor Thank You senator okay yes senator I just had a quick question when you did you actually take a puff of it or did you not take a puff of air or yes I did the way that it's called stealth vaping because this is vapor if you simply hold your breath for about five seconds nothing is released unlike cigarette smoke where you can hold your breath as long as you can but the second you open your mouth you're gonna have a puff of smoke come out so yes being from New Jersey where each cigarette use is banned I stealth vape everywhere that I go aside from perhaps work because I don't want to open up that can of worms but everywhere else I use my e-cigarette in complete violation of New Jersey law and no one ever notices thank you I like candor I hope it's never used as evidence in courts I was kidding if that's the case this is being broadcast justification and tape all right seeing no other comments or questions from any of the members do we have a motion I would you like to close so you can make the motion first that's fine senator Wolk moves the bill senator would you like to close first of all let me just say thank you to everyone who came today to speak in fact I am you probably think this strange but I'm very happy that you're here it's great that we have a process that people care enough to come to the building and voice their concerns so I appreciate you all being here even though we might not necessarily agree on everything let me just say a few things I want to just speak a little bit more about the study really quick and then and then close so members we do know that nicotine is addictive there are health risks and there are health risks with electronic cigarettes as well as cigarettes there's there's no doubt to that conclusion vapor may be invisible vapor you may not exhale but eventually you do because you continue to breathe so the problem is there is the possibility for health concerns and health risks and that's that's why I'm here I'm sincere in my concerns as well the study itself just to coat it just a little bit more the one that I quoted which is a University study and I think members when you look at studies we do need to take a look and see who Commission's them we need to see whether it's a university study or maybe it's commissioned by an industry that does make a difference sometimes on the results so the University study does say that all of the elements an electronic cigarette aerosol can adversely affect the respiratory system while some also affect reproduction and development and some are carcinogens and just go on to briefly paraphrase the next sentence basically it states that these items are present in the vapor so there is that information I am glad to continue to work on this issue of scenarios where perhaps Public Health will not be affected I do have to say I am continue to be concerned that Public Health can even be affected in an apartment situation but based on the testimony I heard today by all the witnesses and my conversations with Senator Monning I'm glad to work on that because I can understand that there is a concern and a need but I want to make it very clear this is not a bill that bans the use of e-cigarettes and I have never carried a bill that banned the use of e-cigarettes I did carry a bill and it's cited in your analysis that's what's great about analysis it tells the history I did carry a bill a couple of years ago let me just it's on page five at number five that was SB 882 it was chaptered its law and this law made it unlawful to for to sell or furnish electronic cigarettes to persons under 18 so that mirrors you know the the smoking laws because of our concern for addiction for young people which I understand obviously you're concerned about as well so that's the law that I worked on previously so I just want to correct you that's the law that's the history that's what's there so well well it is correct it is correct so with that members might appreciate your aye vote thank you very much we have SB 648 Corbett it is due pass to judiciary call the members Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson no Anderson no Belle de Leon DeSaulnier this on your eye Monning aye Monning aye Nielsen no Nielsen no happily well well I that currently is for tattoo there's some members absent we're gonna put that bill on call and we'll lift that call when they return thank you very much mr. chair and members thank you we have a senator Huff SB 669 item number 8 emergency medical care and epinephrine auto-injectors Thank You mr. chairmembers anaphylaxis is a severe whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that's become an allergen according to recent medical studies anaphylaxis allergic reactions are responsible for 1,500 deaths a year in the United States an epinephrine auto-injector the EpiPen is a medical device used to deliver a measured dose of epinephrine using auto injector technology it's used for treatment of acute allergic reactions to avoid or treat the onset of anaphylaxis Senate bill 669 enables California to join a growing group of states that provide training in the proper use of epi pens by making these auto injectors available by prescriptions to individuals pre-hospital emergency medical care person first responder or lay rescue who successfully completed specified training and certification death from anaphylaxis remains a real and widespread problem and under current law there's no effective treatment to prevent anaphylaxis cardiac arrest unless the victim has an EpiPen and as I've able to self administer the injection before losing consciousness the purpose of SB 669 is to increase the chances that if a person suffers a life-threatening allergic reaction there will be someone close by with an epinephrine auto-injector and without facing civil liability for trying to save a life I do have some witnesses here today and ask for your consideration thank you very much please state your name in your position Larry Doyle on behalf of the conference of California Bar Association's with the sponsors of the bill SB 669 would enable California to grow it join a growing group of states which make training available in the proper use and administration of epinephrine auto-injectors make the auto injectors available by prescription to individuals who have completed this training so it can increase the chances of that a person suffers the life-threatening allergic reaction there will be somebody close by with an auto injector who knows the proper way to use it and will be willing to do so or can assist in the self administration of that it's a good bill it's not a broad bill but it's very helpful potentially and helping to save lives and we ask your support for it Thank You anyone else in support lawyer I'm a scout volunteer I'm a Red Cross volunteer and instructor also at cert I'm certainly in support of this bill we've got Good Samaritan statutes and recognition that professional and even lay responders cannot always be emergency medical system cannot always respond to every emergency you've got the Good Samaritan statutes for to encourage lay and professional responders to provide this cardiopulmonary resuscitation the administration of an automatic electrical defibrillator device you've got now in schools actually across the nation and now in California enabling legislation that allows school nurses and even teachers to have training in the use of an EpiPen which is by the way little children are this is a consumer product little children carry this around for self administration you've got it now California is joined the other states that allows us to allow teachers and nurses to be trained in the use of an EpiPen and administer it you do not have this for anybody else outside of a professional response you may not be able to have a timely response to somebody in anaphylaxis where you could die in a matter of minutes I've been around a child that self administered this he got a bee sting and I started seeing him to freaking out knowing that that EpiPen it he's gonna have to self administer was this is gonna be a safety valve if he doesn't get to send correctly he's gonna die because at that point where we were out there in the wilderness there's no way he would have had any of the response had no training in it I couldn't help him but he I could see the fear that he has the pen which was lucky but if he didn't do it right if he's if he if he didn't properly administer this to himself he would have died I saw that sure shock in his face Thank You anyone else in support the California Association of joint powers authorities also in support of SB 669 we want to note and thank the author for ensuring that there is an important consideration in the bill which is the fact that there is a immunity for public entities who correctly train their people on the use of the fu pens in this time of very deep budget constraints making sure that an immunity consideration is in the bill makes us very appreciative and would ask for your support of the bill Kathleen Russell's got with the California Hospital Association in support Alysia Sanchez with the California Medical Association we don't have a letter in on this legislation but we have a support if amended position we would like to see the references to schools remove so so as to avoid any confusion in the implementation in schools and I understand that the author is amenable to those changes so urge your support today thank you is there any one in opposition to the measure good afternoon mr. chair and members Dolores transverse with the California School Employees Association we have a position of opposed unless amended and I understand that the author was going to take our amendments so if he does that today we can resolve our issue and remove our opposition yeah let me just clarify I know in your opening statement you did not say that you were gonna amend the bill but you did pass out sergeant to pass out amendments they are gonna be addressing on page six of the analysis opposition unless amended and then the pre-hospital emergency personnel may already have that ability in number nine and then also the technical amendment so I'm assuming you're willing to take those amendments is that correct yeah so that addresses the issues have been relished with that we remove on this thank you very much anyone else in opposition any questions or comments from the members seeing none is there a motion I'd be happy to move the bill move the bill by Senator Anderson do pass as amended would you like to close ask for your aye vote this is on due pass is amended to judiciary and I will be recommending an aye vote call the members Hernandez sorry Hernandez aye Anderson Anderson aye Bell Gailey on dis onyang DeSaulnier I money money I Nielson Nielsen aye Pavley Wolk Wolk aye thank you thank you member thank you and we'll put that bill on call we have some members absent and that current vote count is six to zero and I said well as I said we will put that bill on call next in line is Senator Yi don't see him here senator Nielsen would you like to go education okay mr. chairman and members Senate bill 645 it relates to the medical repayment payment excuse me methodology for in pot inpatient hospital services supposed to begin July 1st of 2013 it's an entirely new way of compensating hospitals it's an acuity based method now as opposed to the cost based per diem that they've historically had for 30 years probably has a good purpose but I'm afraid it's a bit of a hasty implementation what we're trying to do here and this legislation has been suggested and is sponsored by the California Hospital Association would require Department of Health Services beginning July 2013 to begin to some collection of data to establish the database from the hospitals which would validate the base payment rates provide better guidance and information it also would require an education and a training program for a hospital medical billing staff now I'm a part of one institution and I understand how complicated and challenged these things are and I would argue based on the the new implementation the federal healthcare right now that's descending on all of our hospitals it's a very confusing time and not a time to be hasty the Hospital Association has been somewhat concerned about the lack of transparency and their lack of opportunity to have input right and this is going to affect them for another 30 years I will argue they've been operating under one system for 30 years and now I expect that this next month is going to be a 30 years before we change it again and we better be very careful about it they've been living with it and they've been successful and now we're going to change the rules I would argue that we ought not do that this would then allow a more valid and sound basis for the establishment of the rate it would allow the hospitals to know the rules of the game and have them not just be betting on the comp and that information and transparency I think is important and the opportunity of that billing staff to be familiarized and most importantly for the hospitals to have some very direct input in the crafting of what will be their destiny I think that lends cause for just for a yes vote on the bill I'd like to ask my witnesses Barbara Glaeser mr. Dahle mr. chairman and members Barbara Glaeser with the California Hospital Association we are the sponsors of the bill as the senator has stated this is a brand-new payment methodology for medical papers service for our hospitals what we're proposing in the bill is that we begin to implement this new process but not fully implemented until we've taken six months to collect new data right now we believe the data that the department has been using to come up with every hospital space rate is flawed everything builds from these base rates and we think that we should take the time get up to date and better clinical data build new base rates the department now has a model they can take this better data put it into their model and I think in the long run we'll have a much better program I have two individuals here with me today who have been looking at this over the last several years working directly with the department and I'd like to have you hear from them as well good afternoon chair and members of the committee I'm here to speak in support of bill SB 645 my name is Matt up sure I currently work as a private consultant with a number of hospitals across the state prior to this role I did work for two years with the California Hospital Association and was deeply involved in some of the discussions that the hospitals had with the department I can't say that there has been some discussion in ultimately frustration with the way that the data set that the department built and ultimately the end result of that I don't want to spend too much time today talking about data analytics and their appropriateness and such but I will say that myself as well as other hospitals across the state have identified some errors based on the method that the department used we believe that these errors will ultimately result if this bill is not enacted in a change in payment structure mid-year where not all hospitals could be treated equally a key point that I want to speak to is ultimately DRGs are going to be applicable for a number of our mothers across the state who are eligible for medical when the Hospital Association discussed the implementation of this obstetric or REITs in medical were set to decrease by about 16% keep in mind that currently about 50% of mother's delivering babies in the state are indeed on medical so a 16% decrease in OB rates to hospitals providing that service would be substantial since that time in no consultation with the hospital community the obstetric will rates have been decreased even further decrease to 21% are a decrease of 21% over the prior rate amount with no consultation or work with the hospitals or any of the groups that would be impacted by this and we find that to be very concerning the process that is outlined in the bill would allow additional time to get the data to say right that the department has built previously and we think could ultimately result in a better more accurate payment system for hospitals across the state I know that the Department has said this could take multiple years but we don't think that that's necessarily the case and I just want to reiterate moving to an acuity based system as a senator as recommended or as discussed you know hospitals generally are in support of but doing it right for a program that's going to be in place for you know up to 30 years is of utmost importance I thank you for your time today Thank You anyone else in support good afternoon chair and members of the committee my name is Eric Lucas I'm the senior director of government programs for dignity health TV health has 333 california-based hospitals from Mount Shasta to Central LA we are proudly the largest private provider of medical services in the state serving more than 500,000 medi-cal inpatient days and over a million outpatient visits for Medicaid enrollees Duty health provides roughly 10% of all medical services services to medical patients in the state given our role of médicale we are very concerned about the overall disruption the conversion to DRGs will create as proposed by the Department of Health Care Services we continue to raise genuine concerns over the lack of preparation for the transition the lack of transparency in the policy decision making the use of data from 2009 that it fails to represent the medical population of today and we believe that this will result in unintended consequences and we'll place core services and access at risk I was a participant a participating member of the stakeholder process from the beginning from my perspective the stakeholder process was less about collaboration and more of a venue for one-way dissemination of information for nearly two years I have participated with no opportunity for a real discussion of the issues we were not allowed to review our data or validate the calculations not to mention there was no process for appeal for corrections in our opinion the flawed approach and lack of time to prepare for implementation will result in real impact patient care and access to services our initial analysis based on our own data shows that as a system we could lose nearly 10 million dollars a year on a process that is supposed to be budget neutral in addition we are very concerned about the overall redistribution of funding between our hospitals with wild swings and funding that we cannot easily explain in two cases dignity can provide examples of hospitals that are critical to the access of medical patients that will suffer a huge blow Mercy Medical Center in Redding is the only Hospital in the north state delivering babies over one thousand of them each year in California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles delivers over four thousand babies a year both hospitals are critical providers to the population in those communities yet both hospitals take massive hits to reimbursement under the suppose 'el dignity health stands ready to work with the department to develop a responsible implementation plan that includes the provisions described in sed 6:45 anyone else in support yes mr. chairman Nathan Mansky representing the private essential access community hospitals and also the Alliance of Catholic health care in support of the bill thank you thank you anyone in opposition to the measure any questions or comments from any of the members and their money Thank You mr. chair I want to thank the author for framing this and certainly take to heart the concerns raised by by the proponents as chair of the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services we have an agenda item on this matter on May the 2nd and I've shared with the author I am going to abstain just because this is part of a larger budget puzzle that were continuing to work on that I've taken to heart the inputs and will be respectfully abstaining on today's vote thank you thank you any other questions comments from any of the members yes when you're when you're ready I'd like to move the bill okay we have a motion to move the bill by Senator Anderson's senator I will be supporting the bill I understand the comments and concerns that you have with respect to the hospitals and how difficult it is for them to you know generate enough revenue to stay afloat and with that would you like to close well mr. chairman with almost a smile I would suggest that this new payment methodology is using something and I have to read it I don't think I could get all these words in my brain the all patient refined diagnosis related groups APR DRG that's the best argument for the bill this can be very confusing and we'd want to get it right this time I would appreciate an aye vote thank you and this is do pass to appropriations SB 645 Nielson column members Hernandez aye Hernandez aye Anderson Anderson aye Belle de Leon dis on yay I just Sonia I money Nielson all right Nelson aye Pavley wolf walk I'm the current vote count is five to zero we will put that bill on call and I think I saw senator Yee SB 7 18 hospitals workplace violence prevention plan thank you very much mr. chair and Senators this is a pretty straightforward fill as you can imagine the times are changing and even in our hospitals there are violence and there are safety concerns and so what this bill tries to do is to address that in a rather simple way that would be to require that hospitals top plans as to how they protect their employees from violent behavior and establish a specific security consideration for development of these particular plans condition would require employee training for how to prevent and respond to violent acts temper to and protect victims of violence by ensuring that they are provided with evaluation and treatment they have the right to seek assistance from law enforcement and with that urge an aye vote I think anyone in support mr. chairmembers Stephanie Roberson on behalf of the California Nurses Association proud sponsors of Senator ease SB 718 as you all very know workplace violence has become an increasing national problem but sadly it's played out all too often our hospitals and health care settings and in our schools often coinciding with cuts to mental health services and other safety net programs this is why we feel this bill is timely and necessary I don't want to go through every provision of the bill I think the senator touched on those points but just want to bring some information to this body just yesterday there was a situation that happened in a Children's Hospital Oakland back in 2010 there was a settlement that resulted just yesterday and what happened in that situation was 2010 incident happened where three gunshot victims arrived at a hospital emergency room including one who was dropped off outside the doors when nurses and other emergency personnel sought to respond the hospital security prevented a gurney from being sent out and locked the doors leaving nurses staff and victims outside following that incident as I just mentioned Cal OSHA launched an investigation and citation hospital officials late last week reached a settlement on the citation under which the hospital agreed to expand prevention drills hold regular trainings an emergency personnel taught by an instructor experienced preventing and responding to workplace violence conduct post incident debriefings with affected employees and develop additional protocols in conjunction with union represented employees I also want to mention there's another incident at the same hospital and Cal OSHA did investigate in 2011 including that one involved in a hostage situation the agency issued citations against that hospital along with a small fine listing serious violations including failure to failure to develop and implement procedures and protocols to protect exposed employees in a timely manner and caused unnecessary delay and potential security exposure to employees so we feel that this bill is timely we feel that there's more to do in this area and given the recent instant I've happened in the Bay Area and it was well-documented across the nation there's more to do in this area so with that I would just point on the speck anywhere else and support mr. chair members Caitlin Vega for the California Labor Federation we do believe that workplace violence is a very important issue and after the extent of incidents that have happened at hospitals where health care workers have faced these kinds of threats we think that it is perfectly rational and perfectly reasonable to expect hospitals to come up with prevention plans that's what we all believe and prevent these kind of incidents rather than be forced to respond after all of these terrible things go on let's think about how to keep workers and patients safer thank you thank you anyone else Beth Capell on behalf the United Nurse Association California asks me in support thank you any one in opposition or anyone else in support opposition Catherine masters got the California Hospital Association I'm going to be briefed to a lot of time for the witness who traveled from the North Bay first and foremost we are opposed to this bill as was pointed out in the analysis the speaker NCHA worked through legislation that was created to require hospitals and now currently require hospitals to do a prevention plan and create training based on that prevention plan that is unique to the hospital situations and as was pointed out in the witnesses testimony Cal OSHA does have authority in the site currently based on those plans so this bill creates a duplicate of process that is inconsistent both in the Health and Safety Code and in the labor code and we believe that in our witness will testify that our hospitals do care about employee safety and patient safety and do have plans that address those issues mr. chair my name is rich Cynthia I'm the security director for North Bay healthcare located in Vacaville and Fairfield at thirty two years of experience in law enforcement and retired police commander than the last two years serving as the security director based on my 32 years of experience in law enforcement and municipal and academic environments in the past two years in hospital security I believe this law is unnecessary and worse will adversely impact already limited resources one thing I've learned in my experience is that California hospitals are committed to providing a safe environment for employees patients and visitors and in fact serve as a role model for other states California hospitals are highly regulated regulated with regard to safety and security security and we are currently required to develop a workplace violence prevention plan in addition to safety and security plans focused on patient and staff safety we're also required to report violent incidences involving staff and/or patients to the police and to do so within 72 hours lastly both California Department of Public Health and the Joint Commission evaluate the hospital's workplace violence plan on a regular basis and provide best case models to use if they so wish as example some of the things North Bay healthcare is implemented under its plan include revision of all security and safety related policies and procedures to ensure we remain focus on best practices and remain cutting-edge we have provided over 100 live presentations to over 1200 staff members during the past 18 months with regards to recognizing pending violence behaviors personal self defense conflict resolution active shooter defense and gang awareness this has resulted in a significant drop in adverse situations and not one clinical employee claim for workers compensation for an incident related to a saw Senate bill 17 718 does duplicate many existing aspects under the law were to go beyond existing law it would impose costly but unfunded mandates for example the requirement for comprehensive training to all direct care workers is not justified each hospital's workplace violence plan requires the hospital to evaluate high-risk areas and to provide training to employees in those areas these evaluations differ significantly between an acute psychiatric hospital and a critical access hospital to require training for all direct care workers for example at North Bay would require the training of additional 600 staff members and that would impose substantial costs as you're aware increased costs on the labor side has the corresponding effect of decreasing funds available for direct patient care for these reasons we are opposed to Senate bill 718 make anyone else in opposition any questions comments from any of the members is there a motion to move the bill we have a motion by Senator songyang senator de I will be supporting the bill would you like to close all right thank you very much mr. chair and I'll just briefly comment I think with all due respect to the opposition the reality is that while that may be occurring in his institution all you have to note is the fact that there was a settlement and that settlement was with Children Hospital for voc 'ln so this bill deals with either all hospitals in the state of California and so with that this bill still is needed and if in fact that hospital and others Hospital doing the right thing than they ought to be supporting this because at least it provides you some codification of how we deal with this issue of violence as we move for it so with that her continue her tonight well thank you thank you we have SP 718 ye do pass to Labor and Industry Relations call the members Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson no Anderson no Bao de Leon dis Sonnier - Sonya aye Monning Nielson Nielson no have Li walk that currently is 2 to 2 we have absent members we will put that on call and lift the call upon return over the rest of the Medicare it makes you sing you I believe it's Roth's and a Roth I don't seem in the audience I will take my two bills up next and then we get to sergeant the calls the senator once I'm getting close to my end of my last two bills and I'll turn it turn it over to the vice chair senator are you gonna be taking up item number 2 SP 534 yes I'm mr. chair members this bill SB 534 it's requires four types of health facilities that are currently licensed by the Department of Public Health to comply with federal certification requirements until the department adopts state regulations these facilities are already required to meet federal requirements in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding this bill just allows the department to enforce these standards until they adopt licensing standards of their own this bill is sponsored by the Department of Public Health and the department is here to testify in support there's no opposition to the bill I respectfully ask for your aye vote if the witness was like your hand proceed good afternoon chairman and committee members my name is Cheryl Gordon on behalf of the Department of Public Health sponsors of the bill currently there are four health care categories chronic dialysis clinics surgical clinics rehabilitation clinics intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled with a nursing component that do not have existing state licensure standards however there are federal standards in place for certification it has been the policy of the department to apply those federal certification standards for purposes of licensure however there is no state authority to do so this bill if passed would indeed give us that authority to apply those certification standards until there's a demonstrated need to draft state licensure standards do we have additional witnesses in favor do yvaine witnesses in opposition members do have any questions would somebody like to make a motion thank you we have a motion and the the motion is due pass to Human Services and the senator would you like to close ask for your aye vote mr. chair and members with that let's go ahead and take the vote please Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson aye Anderson aye Bao de Leon dis Sagnier dis song AI Monning Nielson Nielsen aye Pavley wok we're gonna put the bill on hold and bring it up later again for the people that aren't in the committee right now but let's move to item number four SB 639 I'd like to go ahead and present that again Thank You mr. chair and members pleased to present this bill which will implement into state law the cost-sharing provisions of the Affordable Care Act among the many important consumer protections in the ACA is an annual limit on the out-of-pocket cost of six thousand two hundred fifty dollars for an individual and about twice that for a family for families with health insurance this ends medical bankruptcy no longer will we hear stories about families who lose their houses because of the cost of medical care it also means that some one with a chronic condition like MS or a serious condition like cancer can budget for the cost of care knowing that they will never owe more than six thousand two hundred fifty dollars per year additionally Californians purchasing health care coverage in the individual market faced a vast array of products to choose from with different benefit design and that makes price comparisons very very difficult and that's obviously the reason why we put under the governor's desk can pass the essential health benefits to establish what that floor is this bill would require that individual market products sold outside covered California be standardized to mirror the product Seoul inside so everyone knows that they can compare one product to the other whether it's inside or outside of the exchange this will allow consumers to make and compare apples to apple comparison when selecting a product standardized products make comparison shopping much simpler for consumers it forces carriers to compete on cost and quality rather than that difficult to understand benefit design it limits the ability for health plans to cherry-pick healthy lives and it ensures that all products offered to consumers in the individual market have undergone a level of public scrutiny before being marketed to them now keep in mind that a plan can add to it and make it even more robust but they have to absolutely advised by the absolute minimum requirements the opposition will tell you that this limits choice but consumers will still have plenty of options with five tiers of coverage at least two standard benefits in each tier and a multiple insurers in every geographical region in California consumers will have 50 to 80 different insurance products to choose from within that market we have already accepted substantial amendments to make this bill more palatable to the industry and we're willing to continue working with the opposition on the remaining concerns and with that mr. chair members I respectfully ask for an aye vote witnesses in favor Beth Capell on behalf of Health Access California we're pleased to be here as the sponsor of this measure much of what it does as the chair has said is to implement in California law the requirements of federal law including putting into place the five tiers of coverage that are required in federal law and the maximum out-of-pocket cap that is also required in federal law in addition California has given its exchange the authority to standardize benefits which the California exchange has chosen to do and they chose through a very lengthy public process that many of us participated in and the insurers also participated in to standardize those benefits and to set two different standard products for each tier in the market so there will be literally dozens of choices that consumers will face when they go to shop on the exchange there will be considerable choice but what there will not be under this bill is the opportunity for insurers to design products that are just intended to attract healthier lives and to avoid those people who have serious conditions so this is a further effort to help standardize the insurance market and for that reason we're pleased to be in support that's the impulse for consumers consumers Union the policy and advocacy Division of Consumer Reports we are also in strong support of this bill our research of consumers has found consistently what we all instinctively know which is that shopping for health insurance is among the most dreaded consumer tasks I think today the Wild West of the individual insurance market has led consumers to feel confused by the jargon and suspicious that the fine print contains gotchas and exclusions that they don't fully understand our research has also shown that the more choice people have if it's too much it's overwhelming and an undermines sound consumer decision-making one of the favorite parts of the Affordable Care Act for consumers has been the idea that we would finally at last simplify the individual market and the shopping for for insurance policies and make it simple to make those comparisons and to really understand what's covered what's not and exactly how much it costs this bill goes a long way to doing that by standardizing the products outside the exchange as well as inside so that people can really see what's the best value for their needs and we are thus in strong support of the bill thank you Vanessa hina with the Western center on law and poverty here on behalf of the millions of low to moderate income Californians who are going to need to buy health insurance on the individual market here in support Jay here was though at the California pan-ethnic Health Network also in support good afternoon Angela Blanchard on behalf of the United Way's of California as well as children now in do we have additional members of the public that would like to speak in favor with that I'd like to ask and people would like to speak in in opposition to step forward and take a seat and start your testimony please Stephanie Watkins on behalf of the Association of California life and health insurance companies while we appreciate the author and sponsors intent to create a strong and healthy marketplace or insurers compete on price and quality we fundamentally disagree that SB 639 will achieve that goal on the contrary we believe that this measure will have a very chilling effect on the market as it will specifically limit consumer access to new and innovative quality health care options which might better suit their needs as you know our members have demonstrated a strong commitment towards serving the needs of consumers by offering a multitude of competitive and unique products that cater to the individual consumer we believe SB 639 will serve severely impede and insurers ability to offer these types of unique benefit options to consumers in the individual market make it nearly impossible and for insurers to respond to the changing needs and preferences of consumers and instead grants exchange sole authority over product design the role they have had very little comparative experience with finally it should be noted that a B 1602 address many of the concerns that have been raised by the advocates that an absence of a standardized market consumers would find it difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison of product benefit designs may be 1602 allows insurers to make alternative benefit designs while also making it easy for consumers to compare products by requiring insurers to offer at least one standardized product in each of the four metal tiers regardless of whether or not they are currently participating in the exchange we believe the requirements set forth in a B 1602 struck the perfect balance between protecting consumers and providing flexibility in the market so that individuals may obtain the coverage that best suits their needs we believe it's critical at this juncture to put our resources towards implementing the ACA in a seamless way and in a way that helps all individuals make a very seamless transition into having affordable health care come 2014 and unfortunately we believe that we're fundamentally concerned that this place is additional and unnecessary limitations on insurer's without any commensurate benefit to consumers so for those reasons we are opposed Thank You mr. chair members Nicola wheezes with the California Association of health plans we're also in opposition to the bill for many of the reasons that were stated by a click we do want to say that we're proud of the working relationship that we do have with the chair you know we believe that we've been able to work through a lot of ACA implementation bills that will actually help the with the open enrollment period in the start of the exchange coming later this year we do disagree with this bill again it's it's worth noting that the exchange authorizing legislation and the federal law itself will result in a lot of standardization in the market but taking that extra step in terms of eliminating products outside of the exchange and essentially allowing the Exchange Board to control the outside market is a big public policy question that deserves some debate the other issue we'd like to bring up and this is there's a there's drafting a disagreement between us in the sponsor some of the out-of-pocket maximums that apply to the large group market we don't believe are conforming to the ACA we'd like to continue the discussion with the sponsor in the officer author about those elements to see if we can try to fix that issue thank you thank you thank you mr. chairman senators Julianne Broyles here on behalf of the California Association of health underwriters certainly we agree with the points right at my act look in the California Association of health plans would want to associate ourselves with those points we do disagree on how the deductible language in the bill actually will impact the small point of the plans and then we certainly do not believe that there was ever an intention with the federal law to take away all choice outside of the exchange with plans that only mirror exactly what's inside the exchange we think that is not what is fair to the consumer and it takes away choice and competition and stopped the ability to test innovative new products here in California that might lead to better savings down the line as ACA goes into effect we had to open enrollment in October just a few months away the market should be calming down not be turned up further with legislation such as this we asked for no vote mr. chair members Shane Levine on behalf of the independent insurance agent brokers of California in opposition for the reasons stated Thank You mr. chairman and members Maureen Higgins representing America's health insurance plans in opposition for the reasons stated mr. chair and members Michael Hopkins representing the California Chamber of Commerce in opposition thank you are there any additional witnesses in opposition do any of the members have any questions the bill has been moved I do have a concern with this if we if we limit what the private sector can offer then aren't effectively we make making this single-payer I mean part of the the private sector participating in this is the their ability tool to address risk if they are offering the same product in and out of the exchange wouldn't the cost be identical and therefore why would we need the private products why wouldn't everything just be solely with the exchange with single payer well I mean argument to that is it's not even close or won't even mirror any type of single-payer system if you look at the implementation of the Affordable Care Act there are federal laws in place from number one all states have to have an exchange if the exchange isn't set up by the prospective state then the federal government sets it up the federal government has put a upon each state to determine what those 10 essential health benefits are we voted on those the governor signed it there in law if you look at what's going to be sold within the exchange you have and in exchange and outside of the exchange in the small group and the individual market you have the absolute you have to provide the floor which is the 10 essential health benefits and I keep hearing about chilling effects of the market unique benefit options innovation for new products when in fact it's already in state law and it's required by federal government of the ACA that there's an saluté floor which is a ten essential health benefits in which we want to put into the image of market to compare the two they still have the ability to have other kinds of products above and beyond products that aren't in the ten essential that they can compete to try to bring in those those individuals whether it's you know acupuncture chiropractic services things to a track but their floor has already been settled but here's where I think it's really important the reason why I think a policy like this is important is we have in statute that we're gonna be requiring everyone to purchase health insurance government has set up the floor but yet we're dealing in a world where which I would hope you agree is the market in the exchange right now there are numerous amounts of insurance companies bidding for that new business so it is not one system pain it is the free market system that will be within that system but we need to set that floor and make it a plain even playing ground throughout all structures of it whether it's outside the exchange or inside the exchange perhaps maybe the sponsors can address that as well mr. chair and mr. chair we would concur that this is in fact the what we are trying to do is create competition in the private carriers in the market the competition based on price and quality rather than competition based on designing products in order to avoid the riskier lives so from our perspective what we're trying to do is to incentivize vigorous competition among private insurers more than 30 insurers submitted in letters of intent to bid to the exchange that's a very substantial amount of market competition and a good thing for California that that is the prospect we have before us offering ten tiers I can't do the arithmetic fast enough in my head but if they're more than 30 insurers offering more than offering five tiers of coverage and two standard benefits each that's dozens and dozens of different choices for consumers that consumers will face and so there's there will be competition as Senator Hernandez said the bill has been amended to allow insurers to offer supplemental benefits such as acupuncture and chiropractic and adult dental because that was one of the issues that the industry raised with us that they want to offer this in the individual market to attract consumers we thought that was appropriate and that's been amended into the bill so we have tried to listen to their concerns and balance consumers not being overwhelmed by excessive choice with a but with encouraging vigorous competition on price and quality thank you you brought some excellent points I still have several issues one is although people signed up to be in the bidding process we have yet to receive those bids so to say that we're going to have vids is a little presumptuous we think we'll have bids they signed up to participate in the process because if they didn't then if they chose later to participate they wouldn't have that opportunity so I don't think that that is a strong stand to stand on the second thing is there we don't know what those regions gonna do I mean we could have a region say San Francisco or San Diego or our part of Los Angeles that is robust and has many bids and then we could look at other parts more real more rural aspects of the of the state that may not receive any bids we don't know that yet and the other issue there's two more is by limiting people to virtually mirroring I get I get the focus you know but when I read this bill and by the way I enjoy working with you doctor you you are a terrific chair it's no reflection this is very complicated issue that that there's more than one way to skin the cat so when we're moving forward with it that by limiting choice to consumers I don't think that that was ever meant to be the case but by limiting those choices to consumers were artificially trying to force people into the exchange that may not want to be there at all and if you didn't artificially limit it then people would have more choice at one point at some point if we continue to limit that choice you're going to have everybody in the insurance industry going to the PUC and requesting that they be regulated like the PUC because we've we've no longer turn them into insurance companies we'll turn them into payment plans the the the final point is I find it somewhat insulting that we are saying that our consumers can't make choices for themselves and we want to limit their choices as opposed to give you a broad opportunity and unfortunately for those reasons I won't be able to support this today I want to see the exchange work and I fear that we're making choices on presumptions that we can't guarantee you're going to happen and you know you're from now after this thing has been moving and we have some prediction a year from now when we have sees some of this in how it moves forward then I'd be willing to come back and take a look at this and I'd look at it in a completely different filter but I'm worried that we're waiting down the exchange and we're making judgments when I just want to get it to work I mean we have people in October and in the first year they're gonna be counting on us and I fear that that we're trying to protect too much and I know how hard doc that you've been working on this and I respect all your hard work on this one though I'm gonna have to disagree with you on but voted with you in the past and I'm sure there'll be plenty more votes I will be voting with you in the future thank you do any other member I we've heard from the opposition do any other members have anything that they wish to ask or participate in may we get a motion Thank You doc would you like to close yes I agree that the absolute most important thing is the success of the exchange and the segment of the population that I think this would address I would hope or individuals who absolutely don't have to have the exchange because you can only get subsidies within the exchange so if you have somebody that is qualified for a subsidy that's where you want them to go regardless and the success of the Affordable Care Act is getting as many individuals insured as possible to reduce risk and lower cost but I also believe that if you're gonna have that product and you have a floor over the essential health benefits within you have to offer that exact same product outside and there are still going to be innovative ways for the market to be able to address the additional benefits to draw in the market and to answer your question with regard to the rural communities I think the individual market and the market forces themselves are gonna play itself out if you have fewer health insurances companies that are gonna be doing business there unfortunately seem like prices could go up because there's not as much competition and we want to make sure that it's as stable as possible so with that I respectfully ask for an aye vote ocean is due pass to appropriations and if you take the vote please Hernandez aye Hernandez aye Anderson no Anderson no Belle Belle aye de Lyon just de Leon aye dis song yay this on UI money mining aye Nielsen no Nielsen no probably walk walk aye the vote is 62 the the pills out we're gonna leave it on call to allow senator Pavley they are done thank you oh she's not here today well the Ville is out 62 thank you that moves us to our final issue of the day item number 7 SB 667 Roth healthy eating program senator Roth Thank You mr. chair and members Senate bill 667 expands the focus of the healthy eating promotional program at the Department of Health current law requires the Department of Public Health to establish and implement to the extent funds are available five a day for better health program to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables since the statute was written other programs have been developed by the United States Department of Agriculture's such as choosemyplate.gov which was developed to promote a balanced diet and healthy eating beyond increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables in addition this bill would include as a possible funding source agricultural marketing orders developed under division 21 of the Food and Agricultural code the inclusion of the marketing order strengthens the law makes it clear that the legislators desires for the Department of Public Health and the Department of Agriculture to work together to participate in these programs there is no opposition to this bill however I do have a witness here in support of the measure from the sponsor of California grocers Association mr. Louie Brown mr. chair mr. chairman members of the committee Louie Brown on behalf of the California grocers Association California grocers association appreciates and sees the importance of healthy eating programs this was actually brought to our attention by one of our members that deals with the United States Department of Agriculture and others on these programs to show that the code right now is outdated so that's a simple cleanup to bring it up to date and a and actually just make it more generic so it doesn't need to be updated as new programs are developed in the future but more importantly is the oversight of current statute of not including agriculture marking orders which really is more than half of the programs at the California Department of Food and Agriculture looking to promote and support programs like milk celery peaches plums etc and we believe could be a strong partnership with these programs in the future therefore we ask for an aye vote Thank You anyone else in support any opposition comments question from the members we have a motion with the bill by Senator Wolk I will be supporting the bill senator would you like to close I ask for an aye vote thank you would you call the members this is SB 667 Roth this is do pass to appropriations call the members Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson Anderson no bow-bow aye de Leon de Leon aye this on you this on yeah I Monning Monning aye Nielsen Nelson aye Pavley Walt Wolk aye current vote count is seven one I believe all of the members are here that bill is out Thank You congratulations senator we're gonna go back looks like we have everyone here Pavley senator Pavley is absent we're gonna do the consent calendar consent Keller as item number one and item number two SB 3 5 7 and SB 8 1 6 call the absent members Bell well I see Leon Leon aye based on yo this on yeah I Pavley that carbo count is eight to zero that bill is out or those bills are out we're going to go to item number two SB 5 3 for current vote count is four zero motion do pass to Human Services call the absent members well I de Leon de Leon aye Monning aye Monning aye Pavley walk walk that current vote count is eight to zero that bill is out item number 3 SB 588 Emerson motion do pass to judiciary current vote count is five to zero call the absent members Val Val aye de Leon de Leon aye de songyang this long yeah I Pavley current don't count is eight to zero and that bill is out item number four was already passed and it's out where item number five SB six four five Nielson do past appropriation current vote count is five zero call the absent members Bell Bell aye de Leon aye de Leon aye Monning Pavley current vote count is seven zero that bill is out item number six SB 648 Corbett the current vote count is four to two do pass to judiciary call the absent members bow-bow aye de Leon DeLeon aye Pavley current vote count is six to two that bill is out item number seven it's SB 607 is out yeah we're at item number eight six six nine huff do pass as amended to judiciary current vote count is six zero call the absent members Bell Bell aye de Leon DeLeon aye Pavley vote count is eight two zero that bill is out the next bill is item number 9 SB 7 1 8 Yi do pass to labor in industrial relations current vote count is 2 2 2 call the absent members bow-bow aye de Leon DeLeon aye Monning Monning aye Pavley walk that kirbo count is five to two and that bill is out that concludes the business for the day and we will be adjourned"
jQeD_o-v_Lk,CA,05-21-2014,"good morning everybody this is the May 21 2014 meeting of the assembly Committee on Appropriations we are one shy of a quorum but we are going to start as a subcommittee and first on our presentation list today is mr. Dickinson mr. Dickinson believe you have one bill before us today and then we bill 1500 correct floor is yours Thank You mr. chairman and and members as noted this is a B 1500 and in light of your calendar and the fact that this is the Appropriations Committee I will truncate the remarks simply to to note that this bill will prohibit the direct delivery of electronic cigarettes to minors that's it that's what this bill does and it does that by simply requiring that an adult sign for any electronic cigarettes that are purchased online or by other than face-to-face means it is up to the retailer under the bill under an amendment we took in an agreement in the government Operations Committee it is up to the retailer to get the information regarding age and other appropriate information to deliver the UPS FEDEX whoever it might be has no obligation in that regard and has only the obligation to have an adult signed for the delivery of the C cigarettes at the point of delivery that's it that's it and I want to simply note a couple of other things mr. chairman first of all of course as the analysis indicates these are minor and absorbable cause but beyond that what's interesting is that many a cigarette merchants already require adult signature upon delivery and in fact in March of this year v2 cigs would only ship their so called starter kit with adult signature upon delivery and wine and cigarette merchants already use these procedures in fact the wine Institute has stated that a signature of an adult is a model policy which is quote economically non discriminatory unquote so I think this is a bill that is eminently reasonable I think we all realize that we want to protect our children from receiving whether it's tobacco or alcohol or cigarettes that it makes sense to have this kind of simple protection in place and with that I would request respectfully an aye vote thank you very much we're going to pause for just one second and establish quorum I'm secretary please call the roll Gatto I'm here Bigelow yeah Bocanegra yeah Bradford Calderon Campos Donnelly Eggman Gomez hold in Jones Linder pan quirk here really Thomas Wagner Webber okay a quorum is present let's continue now with your witnesses in support thank you hello chairman Gatto and the rest of the members my name is Kate Wooley I'm a real estate agent here in Sacramento and I'm a community volunteer and most importantly I'm a mother I have two teenagers and a preteen and I completely support this bill this is a very common-sense bill I'm sure all of you parents would agree we need to put up every barrier that we can to protect our children from addiction this is going on right now in our schools children are getting prepaid cards they are making these purchases online they're having them delivered to a friend's house or their own homes and then they take them to school the other children are able to get maybe some THC oil and get high and also of course they use the the nicotine so please this is a very common-sense bill it seems to me no reason why this shouldn't pass I want to thank you very much for considering this and and thank you thank you very much that's going to next witness in support mr. chair and members Betsy Armstrong on behalf of the county health executives Association our folks are the County and three City Health Department directors around the state we believe this is a modest approach to essentially what we see is an alarming rise in the use of teenage use of these e-cigarettes and we urge your support thank you thank you do we have a third witness who wishes to speak now okay let's go to public comments and support then hello my name is Kathy Hall I'm a volunteer with the California state parent Teachers Association and we are strongly in support of this bill good morning chairman Gatto and honorable owners of the committee my name is Bernadette Ariano and I represent the California Children's Hospital Association and from a public health standpoint we think this is a very important step forward to prevent children from getting their hands on tobacco products and the urge your strong support thank you andy Katz representing Breathe California in strong support we're very concerned from a health perspective that nicotine addiction can lead to reversion to traditional cigarette use which we know is very dangerous to the public health thank you for your support hello members Cali hampt on behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association we are in a supportive amended position on this bill to prevent the potential negative public health impacts of e-cigarettes we strongly support laws and regulations that prohibit the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes to youth including e-cigarettes and smoke-free laws and in the definition of tobacco products the definition of e-cigarettes and this smell is inadequate and we feel that it can be better be defined and look forward to continuing to work with the author on this amendment in a future policy committee thank you good morning Tim Gibbs with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we also have a support if amended position for the same reasons we'd like to see a more accurate and broader definition of e cigarettes to be sure that cigarette manufacturers and tobacco companies can't escape proper regulation by seeking to define e cigarettes in the niche markets so for those reasons we are supportive amended hi Lindsay Freitas with the American Lung Association also support if amended for all the reasons that heart and cancer specified Nicole were tlemen on behalf of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in support any other public comment in support i let's other witnesses in opposition step forward to the Dyess or the table rather than whatever it's called good morning my name is Jim root I am with California vapor association we're an industry group representing retailers and ejuice manufacturers first of all I'd like to point out some assumptions in the wording of this bill that'll likely face litigation and litigation challenges and possibly get it repealed completely there are several mentions of e-cigarettes being a public health hazard the wording obviously taken directly from anti-smoking regulations though there have been many studies that show there is no secondhand affect of vaping so to characterize this as a public health hazard is inappropriate whatever effects vaping has on the user do not translate to anyone around them my other concern on this bill is the undue financial pressure it will put on the businesses and the consumers this action will likely send businesses to other states and consumers looking to buy their products from unscrupulous dealers should there be a penalty for selling to minors absolutely should we find a way to hold both online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores accountable yes we support the no sales to minors regulation but we want to see it have a true impact and not just give it lip service in fact we're currently searching for legislators that'll is willing to go one step further and create a separate licensing program under the tobacco statute for vape shops and a juice manufacturers this would allow us to include stiff penalties for selling to children even to the point of closing their business a licensing program would allow the state to monitor these businesses and put it under the umbrella of tobacco enforcement where the local authorities are currently doing a great job investigating unscrupulous retailers to sell tobacco products to kids let's not waste our time on creating laws that have no tangible effect on protecting kids let's do this right the first time thank you Kris Khan representing VMR products were the makers of v2 electronic cigarettes we are opposed we had been working with the author's office on amendments as it came out of Geo committee we thought those amendments were going to focus on the front end of the process we support a verification we think that's done properly at the at the front end at the time of sale the bill includes a back end secondary age verification as well that we feel is unworkable at cost to the product and is an inconvenience to our customer we also think the bill is a little premature given the fact that the FDA is embarking on their regulatory scheme for this industry and we look forward to no vote thank you it's good of public I'm sorry other other my name is Sally ketch I am a nonsmoker I have never smoked a cigarette or anything else I married a smoker who had smoked since his teens he has now quit smoking due to electronic cigarettes I believe that a B 1500 is a solution in search of a problem 20% of teens smoke tobacco cigarettes only 10% of teens have ever tried an e-cigarette if you look at the teens who are non-smokers that drops to about 2 or 3 percent we have no statistics on the number of teens who have actually purchased or even attempted to purchase these cigarettes online I do believe that it is worth verifying the age of purchasers at the time of purchase I don't think anyone should sell e-cigarettes to minors marijuana sales in any form in person online to anyone of any age without a prescription are illegal already and are not relevant to this bill however age verification at the time of delivery while pretty much irrelevant if you are buying a $200 shipment of wine are burdensome when added to a 16 dollar bottle of illiquid I oppose this bill I urge this committee to oppose this bill which will be impossible to enforce will not deter teens from using e-cigarettes and we'll send business out of state causing loss of jobs loss of sales tax revenue increase of products imported from out-of-state or overseas and a possible increase of the number of people who return to smoking from using e-cigarettes thank you thank you I do are there any other witnesses you wish to testify or public comment David Quintana on behalf of njoy incorporated we we are opposed to the bill but first of all I need to say that enjoy is opposed to selling these products to minors and we already implement third party a Jura fication on the front end of these sales we attempted to work work amendments out with this author over and over since the bill has moved out of Geo I think we have offered some very sensible solutions which would well currently the way the bill is written it makes it a de facto prohibition on us selling our products by requiring the the age verification at the door so if we can move back remove that as we have asked over and over I think we can we could move forward but until that happens we have to ask that that you oppose this bill any public comment in opposition seeing none Department of Finance mr. chair and members finance is neutral on the bill and notes that it may prevent access to e-cigarettes through the internet and telephone sales by minors thank you other questions or comments from the panel mr. Bigelow question mr. dick to the author let's start just follow the trail first question federal drug included administration how already is promulgating the rules prohibiting the sale of electronic cigarettes do we really need the bill and thanks for that question mr. mr. Bigelow in fact what what the FDA has done is proposed regulations I think we are we are all aware of two things one it takes a heck of a long time to get federal regulations if we ever get them and two they are very likely subject to change through the process of considering regulations so it is indeed possible that someday the federal government will in fact promulgate regulations which would address this subject but unless on until they do which is far from a certainty it makes sense for us in California to take action to protect our young people and given the fact that these federal rules are supposed to be finalized this summer does that change your mind in any way about your bill because it appears that these are going to be finalized on the federal side if they are finalized I will applaud the federal government for doing that if if that were to happen that this summer it would set a national record for the adoption of regulations I believe them when they say they think they're gonna do that but let me just express my skepticism okay I've got that part next question can you address the concerns that were raised by the last speaker in opposition with respect to making it in well making it so that they can't even sell the product yes I don't understand that that argument frankly what the argument is here as I understand it is that what's acceptable to the opponents is to take information about about age and the like at the time the order is placed when there's when there's no ability to see who's providing that information and yet there's an objection to obtaining a signature of an adult when the product is delivered as is required for tobacco products and for alcohol today now I gather from what I've heard although it wasn't expressed directly here that the on workable part of of this is that somehow the amount of purchase of e-cigarettes is not significant enough in dollars to to make it worthwhile when you have to add on a charge that is is levied by the by the deliver and connection with that I don't know how many of these sales are of a 5 or 10 or $15 nature but that same requirement applies to alcohol and it applies to tobacco so there's no distinction that I see in in this case among the three products we're talking about maybe it would bear some clarification by the maker of that question because it seems a little bit confusing so if you could yeah absolutely first of all we're not tobacco there is no tobacco and e-cigarettes you're not going to take five drags on an e-cigarette and then go drive your car wrong lay down the freeway so please make sure you don't compare each cigarette to alcohol and tobacco they are very different products right now most people when they purchase a cigarette they want to try out the different the different you know the different makers of different manufacturers and so they do go onto the Internet what mr. Dickinson would do is force everybody who wants to implement some sort of harm reduction strategy to their current smoking is to go to the convenience store and face the great wall of tobacco at the convenience store as they try to as I try to you know purchase their e-cigarettes so what what the reason I said it's approach it is a de facto prohibition on us selling is because most of our products are like $5.99 $6.99 most of the people order one or two at a time they don't order like they order wine which are usually two to three hundred dollars ups would charge us five dollars to ship that product thereby you're doubling the cost of our product making us not able to compete mr. chairman your indulgence of course I don't want to extend this debate too long but I want to make two points here first of all v2 cigs already requires an adult signature upon delivery for theirs their so-called starter kit they're doing that already so if we're talking about people who are testing it out that's what they're doing today and secondly as v2 cigs set in a Forbes magazine in October of 2013 sales in 2012 or 80% online for for e-cigarettes but that the person representing the company interviewed said sales would be less than 50% of the business in in the immediate future because online is retracting because retail is growing even faster so walls of cigarettes if people want to get you cigarettes let them get cigarettes they're not going to be deterred by walking into their local brick and mortar retailer where the sales tax stays here as opposed to going online that does assume they have a local brick and mortar retailer I just want the witnesses and you know if you are asked a question you can feel free to pipe in there if they vice chair to address the question about the delivering agent so when an item is ordered take us through the steps of who's responsible for validating that the person is 18 years old you have somebody who says they're 18 somehow they have to approve they're 18 when ordering take me through the steps of the chain of actions so so when you place an order online you would be asked various questions to ascertain age and that is that is the front end verification that the opponents are talking about that is what we have in the bill what we have have added is simply that when the product is delivered when possession is taken by the recipient the person who ordered there has to be an adult that signs for it at that point because that's the only point at which you have face to face verification that you're delivering it to somebody of age is that any different than any other product that is shipped that requires an aged sir person of adult age to sign for it's essentially the same it's the same procedure if you're if you're buying alcohol or you're buying tobacco when you go online that there's supposed to be verification of age at the front end although it is not done very rigorously research shows and then a signature is required of a dolt of an adult at the point of delivery who is responsible is it the entity that delivered it whether it be post office or some other entity that delivers by vehicles to a person's residence or is it the manufacturer or their place of origin of sale it's it's the respond at the point of delivery yes it's the responsibility of the delivery agent to obtain the signature okay that's that's their responsibility thank you okay I believe we have a few more questions members who wish to ask questions going to mr. ridley-thomas followed by mr. quirk and then dr. pan mr. Dickinson seems like a part of this challenge that you're trying to address us to deal with the use of marijuana each cigarettes and vaping what is your position on marijuana and it's non medicinal uses and the like this bill doesn't address marijuana well I think that a part of the usage that we see with younger people has to do with the usage of marijuana I think that's acknowledged it's acknowledged in one of your witnesses letters that was given to us and kind of popular conversation about the product being do you appreciate that maybe if we focused on marijuana the debt would get to some of the concerns about youth usage and the like mr. ridley-thomas this bill addresses e-cigarettes this does not address marijuana whatever the connections others may make between marijuana and ecig retsoor connections they make is this this is confined to e-cigarettes if they use the paraphernalia for other purposes and a cigarette that's something they do all we are all we are addressing here is in the integrity of making sure that is an adult who receives the e-cigarettes and not a minor now this bill is currently silent on components versus fully contained each cigarettes correct this this bill uses the definition that is in existing law that that says electronic cigarette means a device that can provide an inhalable dose of nicotine by delivering a vaporized solution I think that's inclusive of components as well I'm not sure that the the analysis or legal analysis suggests the same and that may be an update on the definition is appropriate we've discussed the FDA forthcoming regulations in the leg it seems to me that this measure is a bit premature toward that effort I understand I think what you're trying to get at you told me about your intent but this seems to be a ahead of where we are and I don't know that it gets to the root because my concern is frankly the use of marijuana by minors I you know those I have a significant concern about it as well but from my observation that's a bigger challenge with respect to e-cigarettes so today I won't be able to support the bill mr. quirk mr. Dickinson I'm going to be supporting the bill you've done a great job answering all the questions in the bills original form I couldn't support it because I felt it would ban internet sales even to adults but in this form I think it's great look I'm a big supporter of medical marijuana anything that would interfere with medical marijuana using these devices I would be opposed to this does not do it someone has a problem being at home during the day they can certainly go to retailers this does not keep these devices out of the hands of adults but it is extremely important to keep them out of the hands of children look teenagers have immature brains they shouldn't be smoking marijuana they shouldn't be smoking they shouldn't be using these as nicotine delivery systems I suspect dr. pan will have more to say on this thank you for this bill thank you very much dr. pan thank you certainly I have exactly I do share those concerns about exposure to nicotine and other substances and in adolescent and child brains that's a big issue so I think that does lead to my question which has to do it actually that the definition of cigarettes in fact I know that may the public health folks and the Cancer Society lung xiety and so forth are concerned about the definition are actually the narrowness of the definition of e-cigarettes and that in fact that that's something that tobacco companies your allies are actually using to try to undermine regulations by the FDA that are skirt those definitions and so I know that they have proposed terms language to broaden the definition to actually to be sure we have an inclusive definition to be sure that we're not actually carrying the water for tobacco companies and their strategy to try to actually avoid regulation the e-cigarettes so are you committed to making those kind of changes to your bill so to be sure that we actually have a bill that's not a Trojan horse for tobacco companies well let's be let's be clear about this we are using the definition that exists in state law today those who sell e-cigarettes have asked for a change in the in the definition in a way which I presume they believe would be beneficial to them though such as heart and cancer have asked for a change in the definition in a way that they believe would be more protective of public health if you were here earlier you would have heard heart and cancer testified that they support this bill if amended and would like to see it continue to move so we can have the discussion about hopefully arriving at a definition if we're going to change it that that will be acceptable and will protect public health I take second place - no one - no one in my time spent protecting children and public health so I more than happy to make a commitment to this committee that that will be a foremost consideration as this legislation moves forward so just to follow up so this is a commitment to to burn your language as suggested by cancer among and so forth the public health and the legislative process will take its course any other questions or comments from the panel mr. ridley-thomas has a follow up followed by mr. Holden mr. Dickinson in light of your comments about public health and the like to the chair of the Health Committee on which I said why wouldn't this bill seen before the Health Committee why we've been hurt by the health why was it not heard by the Health Committee I don't sit on the Rules Committee I don't make me I I can I can just state that the bill was referred to I believe government organization around and then here and that's it and that's a decision made back in December if and and I just to try to answer mr. ridley-thomas question mr. Chairman I was informed that the bills with this subject matter have liyan historically always go into government operations thank you I ask that it be referred to health mr. Holden mr. Dickerson I appreciate what you're you're you're trying to get out and I believe that there's merit to your bill I believe that there's been some clear and in very important issues raised that would continue to present hurdles to the ultimate success of your bill I view quite frankly if this was a policy committee if this were health then I think that many of my concerns I would sort of tag on to with many of those who spoke in terms of some of the other issues that are underlining here it's a fiscal committee I will support your bill out of committee today but that by no means as a guarantee that I will support it based more on the merits obviously of the policy as it's presented on the floor but I do think that the what I've heard is there's a common link here in arguments were even the opponents and you and your proponents are on the same page and relationship to protecting minors and and I think that that is ultimately the goal how it is ultimately wordsmith and defined and framed there's still some work to be done so having at least shared that with you and those who have spoken both in favor and opposed that's where I stand today thank you any other questions or comments miss compass just one and I know that mr. pan had addressed this as well and and I listening to Assemblymember Holden's comments and I know this is a fiscal committee and I listened to the witnesses as they came up in support and one of the things that kept coming up and I understand that you know policy will evolve as the bills evolved through a process here but one of the things even from the opponents and from your supporters the definition kept coming up and I know that after it leaves this committee and it it goes to the floor and depending on what happens there that at some point do you anticipate that that will be an item that you will address I am perfectly happy to try to arrive at a revised definition that works and is protective of public health it's a difficult subject and the as I mentioned the proponents and opponents have different ideas about how the definition should be changed that doesn't that doesn't mean that I will give up in efforts to try to find that common ground that meets the criteria of protecting public health and is and is sufficiently clear it is the reason why we have not addressed the we didn't take up the issue of the definition the definition is in state law as it exists today so if it's going to be changed it should be changed as a result of a dialogue that that comes to an agreement and I'm committed to to that well thank you for for being Frank about your position I appreciate that thank you any other questions or comments seeing them would you like to close actually before you close I'll make my comments people noticed of course that I don't have a recommendation recommendation on this bill and I know that in this committee were often asked to consider a wide range of bills that have gone through the policy process and find themselves on our lap for whatever reason a lot of the discussion of course in this committee has to do with the fiscal and we typically engage in a cost-benefit analysis we we have to look at the wide variety of things in terms of even if a bill doesn't cost much an indirect state costs what the benefit is this bill and from my conversations with a number of members is a little bit vexing to them because I'm you know they're considering everything from the loss of potential sales tax and the loss of potential commerce and the effect on the state to whether or not this this hurts a nascent industry the direct estate costs are that we in our analysis however are minor and you know I personally will be voting aye on this bill I have not given a recommendation to the rest of committee because I know that there's a lot of members with very strong opinions on this and but that's where things stand so I'm you know close mr. chairman thank you I appreciate this wide-ranging policy discussion we've had this morning and the Appropriations Committee and in closing I just want to note that the Centers for Disease Control report each cigarette use has doubled among middle and high school students between 2011 and 2012 that is in one single year this month the Legacy Foundation survey found 14 percent of those 14 to 17 and 39% of those 18 to 21 had tried an e-cigarette this is obviously something that's gaining gaining traction we're trying to take a small step here to protect our young people and we will continue to work to find that happy meeting place on this legislation but give us a chance to do that please I asked respectfully for an aye vote is there a motion on assembly bill 1500 so moved Bill's been moved and seconded madam secretary we have a request from both sides for a full roll so please call them all got him I got her I Bigelow to the author I thank you for the responses to my questions unfortunately you didn't quite get all the answers that I needed so I voted for this in the Geo Committee but today I'm gonna recommend that all the Republicans lay off on this bill sorry about that not 40 Bocanegra Ratbert Calderon Campos Donnelly Eggman gomez Holden Holden aye Jones Linder pan quote I vote aye and look forward to they'll change in language pan aye quirk aye quirk aye really Thomas really Thomas no Wagner Weber aye Weber I write that bill is on call thanks very much yeah so we have next on our agenda is mr. Chesbro all right mr. Chesbro you have you have window before us which is in our suspense file it's Assembly Bill 2035 I assume by your presence here that you wish to present on it the floor is yours Thank You mr. chair I present to you a B 2035 which establishes a state plan Shh to serve commercially and sexually exploited children and alliance current policies to better meet this populations needs currently in the state of California services for this population are lacking and children are often being arrested for crimes that their traffickers forced them to commit in order for them to receive any services or support a B 2035 will help provide better care for all minor victims of human trafficking by providing the victim services through the juvenile dependency system additionally the bill provides for interagency protocols for responding and serving these children through a multidisciplinary approach traffic children need to be recognized as victims and be provided services through a system designed to protect abused abandoned and sexually assaulted children not a system for children who have committed crimes while California has strengthened its efforts to combat human trafficking a statewide comprehensive approach has yet to be enacted to assist and protect abandoned children I have with me Kate Walker staff attorney for the National Center for youth law and Brenda Dabney from the children's Law Center of California this bill has a long list of supporters and no opposition welcome thank you for being here and first witness may just fine thank you good morning my name is Kate Walker I'm an attorney at the National Center for youth law in Oakland we advocate on behalf of low-income children and I specifically focus on commercially sexually exploited children we strongly support AV 2035 to serve CSEC the it stands for commercially sexually exploited children a B 2035 is a critical step towards more effectively and appropriately serving this vulnerable population through the victim centered approach as Assemblymember Chesbro said traditionally these children have been served to the juvenile justice system of punitive system that does not account for their needs and and their complex trauma legislation as a recognition that children bought and sold her sex on a daily basis and exposed to unimaginable trauma are victims of abuse and neglect it also recognizes the need to build capacity now these children are victims of repeated sexual abuse and they should be served through a system designed to support and serve them youth who have endured complex trauma require intensive individualized services and supports this necessitates specially trained social workers mentors and systems to wrap services around them this proposal would address these needs and begin equipping the child welfare system as well as the other child serving systems throughout the state to better serve these children for these reasons we respectfully urge you to support a be 20:35 thank you thank you very much any other witnesses in support yes Brenda Dabney with the children's Law Center of California we all recognize that what an adult uses a child for sex it's child abuse the children's Law Center of California in both Los Angeles County and Sacramento County represents thousands of children who have come in to the child welfare system because of sexual abuse however if an adult pays for the sex it's no longer considered child abuse the child is criminalized and not offered support or services of the child welfare system under current law this bill seeks to correct this by making it clear that these children are victims of sexual abuse this is a child welfare problem in fact studies have estimated that as many as 80% of sex trafficking victims have come from former involvement in the foster care system as a director of the children's Law Center here in our Sacramento office one of my most heartbreaking parts of my day is to sit with some of my staff attorneys after they've come from juvenile hall to talk to me about having spent hours in the hall with a young girl sometimes as young as 13 trying to get her to agree not to plead guilty to some kind of a juvenile offense but having her fight back because she knows staying in juvenile hall is the only way that she can be protected from the violence her and we'll put on her when she gets out into the world this is tragic and we're seeing so many of these girls all the time coming from our group homes in our foster homes being exploited being recruited and this we have to put it into this we have to as a state we have to make sure that we develop systems and we educate the professionals that work with these young people to identify and to provide them with services being a victim of commercial sexual exploitation can have a lifelong devastating impact on a young child studies have shown that without the appropriate services survivors often suffer chronic health problems including STDs their increased risk for poor educational outcomes increased alcohol and drug usage as well as suicide and depression and under other mental health issues throughout their lives these are our children California owes it to these children to protect and to serve them and the children's Law Center urges your support of this bill thank you thank you is there a public comment in support good morning thank you my name is Hannah Healy I am with West Coast Children's Clinic we provide mental health services to over 1,500 youth in the Bay Area the majority of whom are in foster care and we operate a program that provides specialized intensive mental health services first sexually exploited youth we serve 125 or so youth in that program each year and 75% of these youth are in have a Child Welfare history so I just urge your support for a B 2035 it's an important step forward for California in terms of treating sexually exploited youth like victims instead of criminals and I think you for your considers consideration thank you thank you any other public comment in support California Alliance of Child and Family Services also in support Silvia Solis Shaw on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco in the office of Mayor Ed Lee and support Jo Michael for equality California also in support thank you they're witnesses in opposition seeing then let's go to the department finance no file mr. chair questions comes from the panel mr. Bocanegra thank you for Cherica don't comment on suspense items but mr. Chesser I want to come really commend you for taking the lead on this currently this is very timely for me in the Sacramento Valley of my district this is an issue and it's been profiled by the Daily News the LA Daily News for the last two or three months and what we're challenged right now working with the local City Council is redefining that these poor children are victims not criminals but they're victims and I'm working with groups like these children of the night nonprofit and the lady Magdalene project out there in this afternoon values so thank you so much and I hope that the bill does move off the suspense file on Friday and as it moves forward to the other house would really like you to consider adding me as a co-author sir absolutely Thank You mr. quick what I like about this bill as opposed to another bill that's come forward is it it concentrates on the children there's another bill here that simply raises penalties I'm not sure how much that's really going to be determined but this bill focuses on the children and I want to thank you very much thank you seeing other questions or comments from panel you may close if you wish mr. Bocanegra said it very well these children are victims not criminals and as time that the law recognized that and we change our practices I asked for your support and moving this on suspense thank you thank you much thank you all right mr. okay mr. Bonta mr. Bonta you would have sembly bill 22 92 which enjoys a do pass as amended recommendation Thank You mr. chair members today I'm presenting a b22 92 which would provide the City of Oakland with additional tools to revitalize economic development in three specific areas within the city limits specifically the bill allows freight rail projects to be funded for infrastructure financing districts thank you within the city of Oakland and requires the city to form a Safety Commission for the howard terminal location Legislative Council just a quick note on the Appropriations here Legislative Council has noted that the bill will be a state mandated local program because the City of Oakland currently has the option to request state reimbursement for the Safety Commission to avoid this cost to the state the City of Oakland has submitted a letter to your committee confirming that it will not ask for reimbursement for the state for the Safety Commission designed in the bill the letter also states that the City of Oakland will approve and send a resolution to the Department of Finance that states that it will not ask for reimbursement for the purpose of this bill thus is currently written a b22 92 will only create costs for the City of Oakland which the city is happy to absorb with me today is Nicolo DeLuca representing the City of Oakland to testify in support of the bill first witness in support chairperson and members of the committee my name is Nicolo DeLuca on behalf of the City of Oakland we want to thank Assemblymember Bonta for his leadership on this bill currently the city is moving forward on three IFD s2 of a maritime theme we realized straight if not yet an eligible expense so this bill fixes that and we are working with all of our stakeholders the Port of Oakland and their tenants on this bill and we respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you any other witnesses in support witnesses in opposition Department of Finance no position on this mr. chair we note the bill lab knows state general fund impact since this bill does not propose diverting property tax from K through 14 schools all right questions or comments from the panel don't see any all right bill has been properly moved and seconded you might close if you wish thank you for your consideration mr. chair members I respectfully ask for your aye vote all right that bill is out on an L roll call which is a b roll call with Linder aye thank you thank you very much okay mr. Mullin mr. Mullin you have an assembly bill 15:48 which enjoys a do pass recommendation thank you sir I will be waving presentation on my bills that are going to consent or suspense just here to present a B 1548 mr. chair members I introduced a B 1548 to address a specific issue in my district where 641 students had their AP test scores invalidated through no fault of their own as you can imagine there were a lot of upset parents students and school administrators so I wanted to be responsive to those concerns raised in my community representatives of the testing agencies educated me and my office as to how anomalous these types of incidents are so I dramatically scaled back my bill so that it would not be a disproportionate response to an unfortunate but very rare incident a B 1548 simply requires testing agencies in California to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the legislature the number of canceled test scores and the reasons for those cancellations and it's sunsets in 2017 the appropriations analysis has indicated that the costs are negligible I simply ask for your aye vote thank you much let's go to witnesses in support see none are there witnesses in opposition mr. mr. chairman Dominic tomorrow here on behalf of the college board there's a fine for breaking our microphone yes I know sure it's very expensive we are in opposition to this bill we are the Testing Service that administers the AP and the PSAT and the SATs tests I'm sure that you remember fondly and and appreciated but this is so rare as an instance 19,000 tests are administered across the country by the College Board of those 19,000 last year nine had incidences where there were test scores that were invalidated for a variety of reasons one of those incidences were here in California of those nine all nine but one eight incidences were retested within 30 days appropriately handled by the protocols put in place and taken care of and everyone moved forward but one instance where that didn't happen was in California for whatever reason the issue ended up in court there was a lot of finger-pointing going around at the end of the day the court found in favor of the College Board that there was no impropriety on the behalf of the College Board there was no divergence from the protocols associated with it we feel that this is just a frictional cost that's unnecessary and therefore we oppose the bill for the reasons that I've stated and several others all right next witness Thank You chair and member kait well on behalf of Educational Testing Service and the Association of American Medical Colleges who administer the MCAT and we appreciate the direction of the bill moving away from us having to it release invalidated test scores but remain opposed to having to report on such minor and rare instances as mr. de Mario mentioned it was one instance in California last year for the AP exam for the MCAT since 2007 only two instances nationwide and so again we just feel that the benefits do not validate the costs thank you very much thank you any persons here who wish to speak favor opposed seeing none I'm going to finance no file on this mr. chair questions or comments from panel mr. Mallen you may close I'm sorry Ziegler about just mr. vice chair has a commenter yes yeah to the author I appreciate what you're trying to accomplish here and I think I understand but I'm a little concerned that it's going from just a single isolated instant to something that's going to be done throughout the state so would it would this bill really have addressed the problem that these students faced I've got several so I'll just take them one at a time thank you for the question Assemblyman you know our suggestion is if this is as rare as suggested this will be a very minor reporting requirement the reality is we don't really know without the reporting you know how widespread this issue is this the first time I heard today about two nationally we simply don't know what the data suggests so if this is as anomalous I suggested this will be a very short report not serious requirements at all and it will sunset in two years okay well if I understand it was a just specific issue one in the state of California and now we're gonna take and and cause folks to have to go out and and go through a fairly rigorous reporting process this is going to cost somebody a lot of money to accumulate this why would why wouldn't we just have the local school district address this and deal with the repents at that level instead of making it a statewide but the locals deal with it I would just take issue with the characterization that this is going to cost quite a bit of money to comply with this report this is simply how many are affected in terms of canceled tests the bills specifically states that a report submitted pursuant to the section shall not include specific or identifiable information on the test subject is a very narrow reporting requirement again we think this is a very modest requirement for these agencies to comply with for two years to see if this really is an issue beyond what occurred in my district well it as as I read your bill I think it does require something like $500 per student on the retail side is that been removed I'm not aware of the $500 per student figure that's that's new tonight okay okay okay we believe that maybe an old piece of information assemblymen there's there's nothing in the bill that deals with that $500 figure I okay so I'm looking at the just a report that we got and it did have that there was a repents of $500 per student do we have a conflict with information so sir that's a proposal by your consultant I believe is that that is no longer on the table that's no longer on the day that's correct okay thank you for that clarification see if I got the final question okay I got all three of my questions so appreciate it given s it are there any other questions by any members finance you answered the question already um we don't have a file on this you don't know okay mr. mr. vice chair we've just pulled a copy of the bill and at least in the ledge councils digest it talks about not 500 but 750 a test agency that intentionally violates any of these provisions is subject to a $750 I don't think that's the penalty mr. Bigelow was talking about but at least that's in there so that's existing code no no not not according to my copy of the bill is that exist that's existing well okay its existing go ahead mr. Mohan sir okay then there's an error with ledge cats okay we have that amazing longer they've got a tower sighs oh it's our belief that that is existing law that's $750 figure thank you thank you thank you appreciated that are there any other questions for medic any other members if not I believe we have a motion what was that it's a biro this out is out on a few roll call thank you sir alinder abstain it's no it's next I had you as yeah those are next of course mr. quark Silva would you like to miss Cork Silva where are you [Music] you have one bill it's a b-26 68 yes good morning members a b-26 68 I'm here to present this bill which would permit nonminor dependent who are also parents to enter a parenting support plan young parents in the foster care system face both the challenges of being a foster in foster care as well as the challenges of being a young and single parent I know that that compounds the seriousness of them being in foster care and to add to that being a young parent unlike most young parents foster care youth who become parents at an early age typically cannot turn to a family for the support they need for the emotional support and whether it be mentoring whether it being a help for that new young child consequently these young parents are often completely on their own as they struggle to balance work school and parenting responsibilities for these high-risk new young babies a V 2668 would require an additional $200 per month to be paid to a nonminor dependent parent who enters into a parenting support plan and again this parenting support plan would have to be approved through various scenarios to make sure that it isn't just an additional resource without the mentoring that we move the bill this bill received bipartisan support in the assembly Human Service Committee and support and has support from a broad coalition and here with me today to testify in support is Brenda Dabney from the children's Law Center a Sacramento thank you first witness Thank You members Brenda Dabney with the children's Law Center of California again unlike most young parents a foster youth who become parents at an early age typically cannot turn to their own parents for emotional support daily or even occasional assistance most parents receive from their own families consequently these young parents are often completely out on their own as they struggle to balance work school and parenting responsibilities not surprisingly this stress lack of resources and simple lack of experience makes these young people very high risk for poor outcomes this legislation would encourage a historian on minor dependent living in a supervised independent living plan to enter into the parenting support plan that Miss Quicksilver just mentioned with an identified responsible adult such as a mentor or relative the plan would identify ways in which the responsible adult will assist the youth and his or her baby upon completion of that plan the custodial nonminor dependent parents foster care payment would be increased by $200 per month so these nonminor dependent would actually get the increase of a $200 a month as an incentive to continue that adult relationship that will be the person that provides modeling and assistance to them in times of need formalizing a relationship with this responsible adult will provide the young parent and the child with guidance support a shoulder to lean on something as simple as occasional babysitting or picking a child up from daycare can be the difference between Child Protective Services involvement or not it will also help the youth to develop a relationship which can outlive a nonminor dependence time in foster care thereby providing another protective measure against future child welfare involvement we urge your support of this bill thank you much any other witnesses in support or opposition Department of Finance nope no position on this mr. chair would you know social services states that there are 2936 nonminor dependent currently in residential placements of which approximately 250 are nonminor dependent parents if each nonminor dependent parent in a supervised independent living placement participated in parenting support plan and received the 200 dollar monthly a payment the annual cost to comply with this bill would be approximately six hundred thousand four hundred thousand that would be general fund thank you very much questions are coming from the panel mr. Wagner well I just think the direction the bill is going is a good one but when I look at the background check I notice what strikes me is somewhat of a missing category of crimes that one oughta dis you know be a disqualification murder is not in there mayhem is not in there when somebody is arrested I know there's obviously a presumption of innocence in the courts but somebody who's under investigation perhaps has been charged with any one of the crimes even the crimes that are disqualifying there's no you know hold on the application while the court system works its way out and so and that that seems a little loose is there or is there a reason it's that loose or if some of those crimes aren't included so what you're referring to is the non-custodial support that's wrong background that that's that's a good note and we can definitely work with out as far as looking into making sure maybe there's fingerprinting something like that though that could be added as far as you're talking about the support right the support mentor but what was there a conscious decision to include some things and not murder mayhem etc well I it says non-custodial and I think what we're inferring there is that through the support plan that person that would be really designated to the minor nonminor dependent would be somebody worthy of that and that we wouldn't be using as you would say maybe former felons things like that as the mentoring counterpart because am i clear on what you're asking well as i understand the bill on minor foster care youth as i understand the bill it requires an individual who wishes to become the identified responsible adult to a nonminor dependent parent to undergo a criminal background check and if the criminal background check turns up certain things that person is disqualified but some of the things that can it can turn up that are non disqualifying are murder and certain other things that I would think I'd be disqualifying so my question you're looking for a disqualification list Wow you've got a disqualification list I mean it's not sure you that we will look very carefully a tiny tightening of that language because I would definitely not want any whether it be a foster youth or my own child to be mentored by anybody that could jeopardize their safety or in this case also another child safety because of the parenting component alright let's go to mr. Bocanegra to the author just want to say thank you and in light of the comments by mr. Wagner thank you for indicating that you'd be look more than willing to strengthen the language or to meet with more stakeholders regarding that language but I just want to be on record as supporting this I was visited by quite a few folks in my district regarding this bill and they are strongly urged me to support it and thank you so much for taking the lead on it thank you already a bill has been moved and seconded I don't see any other questions or comments you may close just that I urge your aye vote on this important legislation that although the numbers are small we said as was noted just about 200 youths that are in this scenario but can be very impactful for that support that they need thank you how much that bill is out on a roll call in Durham with Linder I thank you I just I urge an aye aye vote yeah I know the bills out oh I'm sorry to hear that I was so struck by mr. Wagner that I was thinking about what he was saying but I declare victory and move on yeah thank you right mr. stone mr. stone mr. stone you have assembly bills 16:13 which enjoys a do pass recommendation thank you which I appreciate so I'll be brief 1613 essentially provides parity between the threshold for collecting CalWORKs overpayments and would already exist in current law for CalFresh overpayments what second thank you so we're just trying to align those two and ensure that more money gets in the hands of the beneficiaries and does not get caught up in burdensome administrative procedures and with that I respectfully request your aye vote if you have a few witnesses here witness Thank You chairman and members of the committee Jessica bartholow with the Western center on law and poverty in additions to in addition to the efficiencies noted in the analysis just a reminder that every time that we fail to destabilise a family to create hardship for very very poor children we also gain efficiencies in the services that were providing them and ensure that the money that we have allocated to them which keep them below 50% of the federal poverty line are used for their basic deeds thank you your aye vote Kevin as they call us to California welfare rights organizations and we support this bill Rajai before thinking any other witnesses in support witnesses in opposition finance no file mr. chair questions are coming from the panel all right Bill's been properly moved and seconded it is out on a b roll call thank you very much okay mr. Ammiano if your witnesses are here mr. Ammiano is presenting Assembly Bill 23 72 which is in our suspense file thank you very much mr. chair and members and assembly bill 23 72 will closed one of the most egregious loopholes plagued in California an unintended consequence of prop 13 this bill will require properties to be reassessed for the purpose of property taxes when 90% or more of ownership changes the bill would also differentiate between corporate stock deal purchasing property and regular trading on the stock market for the purpose of capturing when true change in ownership occurs my joint author is here mr. Bocanegra and he would like to share some words and I would respectfully request your consideration to release the bill from suspense thank you much let's go to the first witness in support good good morning and mr. chair and committee members Jennifer Barrera on behalf of the California Chamber of Commerce and we are in support of a b23 72 we believe that the bill as amended provides certainty and clarity with regards to when there has been a true change of ownership and we do agree that when there has been a true change of ownership it should be properly reassessed in to proposition 13 and for these reasons we are in support thank you Silvia Solis Shaw on behalf of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and strong support we believe that this change will lead to a sensible and fair and stable tax structure for property owners and for local governments thank you next witness Nicolo DeLuca and behalf of the city of Oakland and the city of Palo Alto we support this bill thank you any other let's go to public comment support mr. chair and members Matthew Hargrove at the California business properties Association I'll just associate myself at the comments of the chamber in support of the bill mr. chairman committee member silvio ferrari with the California Building Industry Association in support Thank You mr. chair members misha seaman with the California Labor Federation also in support any witnesses in opposition please step forward from the table I broke it to noon thank you sorry mr. chairmembers Gina Rodriguez with the California tax payers Association Cal tax is opposed to a B 2372 until its policy implications can be fully vetted there was no policy analysis available in the policy committee due to the lateness of the amendments and despite the author's apparent intent to achieve greater clarity with changes in ownership and greater transparency and ownership patterns the impact of the bill may have broad policy implications that need to be explored absolutely property needs to be reassessed when there is a change in ownership and Cal tax does not support bad actors that skirt the system however the devil is in the details and with the limited time Cal tax has had with the bill and the amendments that came through yesterday we have identified several concerns policy concerns there's an adverse impact on smaller family-owned businesses once the surviving spouse passes away number two the egregious nosov the 15% penalty considering it would be imposed upon the passing of a surviving spouse when they're survivors death triggers a change in ownership and the family members were unaware of their filing requirements the penalty would also be imposed on nonprofits who were unaware of their filing requirements including hospitals and low-income housing facilities that have a welfare exemption third the deed recording requirements whenever illegal entity has a change in ownership interest like the sale of one share of stock publicly traded or not this apparently would trigger the imposition of the documentary transfer taxes which are massive in some jurisdictions like San Francisco Santa Clara and Los Angeles and finally new compliance burdens every transfer of any ownership interest no matter how small in an entity that owns California Realty would be required with more filing requirements after the passage of prop 13 in 1978 a task force appointed by the assembly and Taxation Committee was charged with making recommendations for definitions that were not included in the proposition david ardor chair of the task force author of California's tax machine and Cal taxes chief tax consultant off Minh has stated that the most difficult issue for the tax force was determining the definition of change in ownership it took the task force three months three months and many drafts to come to a resolution the task force included representatives from the real estate industry title companies banks corporations and Assessors offices and their collective input was necessary because of the complexity of the issue and then try the complex transactions involved if this legislature is going to make a change to a policy that her served California well for decades a change to one of the most complex areas of the tax law that wouldn't it be appropriate to ensure that the bill is doing what it is intended to do Caltex urges that this bill be placed in the suspense file until all the policy implications are fully vetted thank you okay are there any other witnesses in opposition seeing none are the questions are comes from the panel seemed done you may close Thank You mr. chair well Bocanegra on behalf of well i'm also a joint author in this bill I just want to we've heard the name commend mr. Ammiano for his leadership on this issue I think when you have a broad coalition of supporters from John kapal to California Chamber of Commerce to the Business Roundtable and labor I think we've hit the sweet spot and notwithstanding some of the outstanding concerns and issues outlined by our friends at Cal tax we'll continue to work with them on tightening up the language if we can we think well first let me just say that there's no better stronger defender of prop 13 than myself this had nothing to do with prop 13 this is about a loophole that commercial property owners can take advantage of the hope here is that this will move forward and respectfully request that you consider this to move the suspense file thank you much we will give it all to consideration all right we are looking for authors we can go to committee members mr. Calderon okay okay this is mr. Calderon on behalf of Ms Skinner this is mr. Calderon is presenting on Assembly Bill 1934 miss Skinner which has a do pass recommendation ms Skinner is waving on assembly bill 1554 which is in our suspense file mr. Calvin on the floor is yours may be 1930 Thank You mr. chair and members a B 1930 improves access to CalFresh benefits for eligible needy college students the prolonged economic recession has meant that fewer low-income and working class families have the resources I've had the resources to support their children in securing a college degree move the bill thank you with me today I do have Jessica bartholow with the Western center on law and poverty and I respectfully request your aye vote first witness Thank You mr. chair members of the committee Jessica bartholow with the Western center on law and poverty just as a reminder that this bill does not expand eligibility for for snap for CalFresh benefits it only allows the California Department of Social Services and the County Human Services agencies to better understand the exemptions for students and their in their work role in the program the medicinal reminder these students are very low-income without assistance to prevent hunger they may not succeed in graduating by not succeeding and graduating they have less of an opportunity to leave poverty and to prevent reliance on public benefits assistance later in their lives for these reasons we urge your aye vote thank you any other witnesses in support see none witnesses in opposition Department of Finance no position on this mr. chair members but I'm assuming half of the total EOPS participating students become eligible for CalFresh benefits this bill could result in increase administrative general fund cost of approximately 2.6 million beginning October 1st 2015 and 3.5 million annually thereafter further requiring counties to screen CalFresh applicants that determine whether they are participating in EOPS increases county administrative costs that may be reimbursable under the reimbursable state mandate systems the provisions of the Constitution all right questions comes from the panel mr. Wagner the author seems surprised by those numbers do we dispute them this isn't my bill I'm doing on behalf of madam Skinner so you know I feel free to go give her a call all right well maybe your witness has a response if the in that B there is an increase in administrative costs for the County Human Services Agency it's only because it's drawing down additional federally funded food assistance remember that Snap is a hundred percent federally funded and for every dollar we bring down it generates another dollar point a dollar and seventy two cents in economic activity so we would hope that there'd be increased administrative work as a result of this bill that's what it's for in order to draw down anti-hunger benefits for very poor students who the state of California is already investing in and through grants and and bog waivers at the Community College's so I think that that's an important part of the conversation and we would appreciate if the Department of Finance would include these kinds of things in their analysis thank you all right thank you we I I think there's another witness who wishes to you California rights organizations and we basically represent welfare recipients who are trying to overcome poverty and one of the best ways you could overcome poverty is by getting an education and not a poor people who are not who are single people cannot get food stamps so they could have to go hungry while they're trying to break the cycle of poverty and are we asking is people break the cycle of poverty by allowing them not to study on a hungry stomach and we urge an aye vote thank you thank you any other questions or comments from the panel would you like to close on behalf of Miss Skinner respectfully request your support for this measure all right that bill is out on a b roll call with mr. Linder and Wagner voting aye thanks thank you very much all right we have a mr. jones-sawyer next Thank You mr. chair you have one wild 1734 will wave of 1734 and wave presentation on 2427 okay since 1978 which enjoys a Jew pronounce recommendation thank you a B 1978 imposes what is in essence an empowering suggestion box for social workers engaged in child welfare who the bellend this bill established a process where social worker generated improvements and recommendations are included in the child welfare system reform discussions and counting planning document documents with recent sweeping budget cuts to child welfare foster care and realignment is more important than ever for county workers to be included in discussions to identify and implement operational improvements that will reduce paperwork enhance social worker productivity and job satisfaction the fiscal impacts as listed in analysis are listed as fifty thousand two hundred thousand I respectfully ask for aye vote with me today our witnesses on behalf of sponsors SEIU and the Children's Advocacy Institute house witnesses for thank you I thank you mister chair Tia or on behalf of the Service Employees International Union we represent 10,000 child welfare social workers who administer the child welfare service system on your behalf this bill would allow social workers to be able to speak about operational inefficiencies without fear of retaliation like Assemblymember Joan Sawyer noted there is minimal cost to the state if there's any people that we want to speak out about operational efficiencies it should be those workers on the front lines of your on your behalf providing services we ask for your aye vote thank you much any other witnesses in support witnesses in opposition Department of Finance no file on this mr. chair all right questions comes from the panel Bill's been moved by quirk seconded by compost you may close if you wish I respectfully ask for your aye vote that bill is out on a b roll call with mr. Bigelow and Linder voting aye thank you very much thank you mr. Wieckowski is next good morning mr. chair and everyone this is a b20 747 which is the gist sherry committees on the best civil bill it's not a candidate for suspense and it's not a candidate for a consent so that's why we're here it has a do pass recommendation offer clarifies it makes technical changes to our Civil Code that urge an aye vote move the bill second alright looks like we have a question from mr. vice chair of judiciary well yeah I actually as the vice chair of G dish I do feel I have to jump in here I voted against it in Judaea are we I guess we all laid off injudicious haven't been corrected so I'm going to take the unusual step voting against an omnibus bill typically their cleanup bills and this one by and large is but there are couple of policy issues that I think have been put into this cleanup bill that I think belong in standalone legislation that go through a policy hearing that said they're relatively minor but there are some things in here that that a lot of us have voted no on in policy there's one I voted YES on in policy but I still think it's a policy issue so for that reason I think we laid off in judicial would oppose the bill here thank you any other questions or comments from the panel Department of Finance we're neutral on this bill mr. chairman all right would you like to close I just urge an aye vote that bill is out on a b roll call thank you very much right mr. Hall this mr. Hall makes his way to the Dyess this is Assembly Bill 1576 the I'm told that there's quite a number of witnesses here in support and opposition and just want to let lay down some of the ground rules in case folks might not be too familiar with the committee and how we do stuff we are going to allow people to to speak on this generally I know a lot of people travel a long way to speak just ask you to keep your comments rather concise please don't repeat what other people said we're not going to cut anybody off unless you do start repeating what people said know that there's a number of people both on the pro and con side and we're going to try to accommodate everybody who came so far to speak so that being said mr. Hall the floor is yours Thank You mr. chair and members Abie 1576 is a workplace safety measure that we require employer paid mandatory STD testing of adult film actors at least every 14 days and documentation that a condom or other personal protective equipment was used in all adult films produced in California members last year this committee held a very different hurt a very different bill from the one before you this morning since last year I have listened carefully to members and stakeholders and I have worked closely with the Chairman the speaker emeritus and the speaker to craft a narrowly focused bill that does two things one require employer paid mandatory STD testing of adult film actors at least every 14 days and secondly documentation that a condom or personal protective equipment was used and all adult films produced in California members to policy committees have had extensive public debate on this bill and a B 1576 has received bipartisan support in both committees the language in a b 1576 aligns state law with existing OSHA regulations and as noted in the analysis falls below the fiscal threshold of this committee and let me repeat a B 1576 aligns state law with existing Cal OSHA regulations as noted in the analysis and falls below the fiscal threshold of this committee there is however cost to not prioritizing disease and injury prevention the cost to provide only medication for an individual with HIV is in the excess of $600,000 over the lifetime of an individual and since the majority of adult film actors do not have health insurance the cost to medical and insurance ratepayers to treat these actors for an STD could easily be in the millions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers in California members opposition witnesses today will make outrageous and false claims that they have been thoroughly refuted and that has been thoroughly refuted in policy committee one of the Opposition arguments would be that passing a b 1576 will cause the industry to flee to nevada or another state causing a loss of revenue to the state this cannot be far from the truth the fact is that adult film production is only legal in California and New Hampshire Nevada law is already clear on the regulation of sex work sex work is not legal in Las Vegas and counties that do allow sex work condom use and weekly testing is mandatory period remembers the adult film industry's home is and will be in California the fact is the industry isn't going anywhere and frankly I don't want them to go anywhere but California where they employ thousands of people and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue many California studios require condoms on set today and are still extremely successful and still extremely profitable in fact that's recent as may 9th of this year one adult film director made the switch to condoms and testing after acknowledging that the only reason he didn't require them before is because like many in the industry had put profits over worker safety when it comes down to it adult film actors are employees like any other employee for any other business in the state a minimum level of safety and the workplace should not have to be negotiated while some may not agree with this type of work our job here is not to just the type of legal work people engaged in in California but to ensure that all workers are protected in the workplace whether you work in agriculture manufacturing healthcare food service or any other industry all workers deserve a safe place to make a living every committee that this bill went through the members of that those respective committees agreed with that ideology a B 1576 will ensure that these workers are safe at work and will have negligible impacts to the state's finances I respectfully ask for your aye vote we have witnesses to testify in favor of the bill let's go to your first witness mr. chair and members Rand Martin on behalf the AIDS Healthcare Foundation which is a sponsor of maybe 1576 mr. Hall has very eloquently laid out the arguments for this bill I just want to hit on a few points some of them to reiterate and some some one of them knew the fiscal analysis and this committee underscores the fact that this bill is about implementation of an existing policy cal/osha already requires the use of condoms in adult film has been enforcing that policy for a number of year what this bill does is give cal/osha some additional tools to validate the fact that the employers are complying with that policy it also gives them the tool to validate that they are testing their employees on a regular basis it does not create a new testing scheme there's basically a single testing scheme out their existing clinics use existing law to test for all STDs the system that is in place now will continue to be the system in place under this bill all this bill will require is that the employer document that that test took took place the real fiscal issue as mr. Hall has laid out is the cost savings to the state when the state intervenes to interrupt transmission of the pathways of communicable diseases the state saves money we have been on the HIV front we have been fighting this for 25-30 years and we have been very successful in scaling back the cost to the state it is just as true in STDs other STDs that when you can interrupt that transmission you save that person from from the experience of the disease as well as the costs associated with it the state deserves the state budget deserves not to spend money unnecessarily people deserve not to go to work and get sick and for those reasons we would ask you to support this bill today thank you next witness in support thank you my name is Cameron Adams I performed under the name Cameron Bay the adult industry told me that I had to test every 28 days so I tested every 28 days the adult industry told me that I had performed without condoms if I wanted to keep my job or otherwise I'd be replaced so I perform exactly as I was allowed to perform the adult industry exposed me to blood-borne pathogens onset because they just wanted to finish a scene and now I am hiv-positive I did everything the adult film industry told me to do and now I stand before you today hiv-positive the adult film industry focused on their bottom line because they know they could take advantage of women like me they know there is a high turnover rate on women like me and they know that they're breaking the law when they deny a woman like me the cheapest workplace barrier protection and in existence which is a condom they do all this because they don't have to pay for my HIV medication you and the citizens of California are paying for my HIV medication while producers laugh their way to the bank you're left with the bill which is over half a million dollars on medication alone from my lifetime what about the handful performers who contracted HIV just last year in a matter of 5 months it's over 2.4 million dollars coming out of your taxpayers pockets a b-1 576 ensures women like me are protected from HIV and other infections at work like I said condoms costs only 4 cents HIV meds cost over half a million dollars it's time for the adult film industry to consider health and safety a priority over their profits because otherwise we pay the price thank you Thank You next witness in support thank you my stage name was rod Daley I performed in gay films for eight years up until this past August when I found out I was HIV positive during that eight years I only did condom only scenes but I also maintained regular testing I believed that condoms and testing go together testing so you know your status and then the condoms obviously I believe personally that it helped prevent any STD because during that eight years not only did I not contract syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia anything I didn't contract a single STD because the use of STDs I'm sorry it's because the use of condoms so I strongly support this bill thank you thank you next witness hello my stage name was Jesse Rogers I got in the adult industry the day after my 18th birthday I only did it for about a year and a half one of my last scenes after I already had decided to quit I suffered a severe injury by another female adult performer which led me to bleed for several days and I also contracted herpes so I strongly support this bill thank you Thank You next witness mr. chairman and the Appropriations Committee my name is Adam Cohen I'm not an adult from performer I'm a PhD student at the UCLA fielding School of Public Health I got my masters in public health and my bachelor's in public health my interest is research my interest is data and the data shows publication after publication performers are 64 times more at-risk for gonorrhea and 34 times more at-risk for chlamydia than the general population one in three performers in one study were found to have either skew medea or gonorrhea despite industry testing standards another study found that one in four performers if they had one infection would be reinfected within 12 months I followed the data and the data says that barrier protection based on the CDC the American Public Health Association any medical organization the condoms work and prevent infection thank you any other witnesses in support is there public comment in support stewart on behalf of the California Medical Association in support all right let's go to witnesses in opposition please make room at the table I first witness in opposition please feel free to begin Karin Tainan I'm an attorney representing a number of adult entertainment companies that are here in California and I'd like to start off by discussing the cost of this bill is being drastically under calculated you'll note that this bill requires the California Department of Public Health to create new testing protocols and regulations that cost has not been contemplated these new testing protocols that that the California Department of Public Health would have to come up with would clearly be required to be updated on a yearly basis there are no present California Department of Public Health regulations for the adult industry another point to follow on that is the additional cost that will be required with regard to any state agency including the department of industrial relations to obtain this log that the bill requires I don't believe that cost has been contemplated and it would require state agencies to pursue other and pursue subpoenas and have greater legal cost you've heard that the industry will not leave California we've discussed this at other committee meetings the industry is leaving California and will leave California there's there's been a little bit of mis-education here about whether or not this industry can operate in other states this industry can operate in other states there's been a conflagration of the term sex work with the term adult film performer prostitution statutes do not govern adult film performances in other states comparing sex workers to adult film performers is not appropriate in this context and the support and the arguments based around that are absolutely and unequivocally incorrect as Ben has as has been mentioned in previous committee meetings some of the mid-sized companies have left Southern California typically those companies employ 15 to 20 individuals and have revenues in the range of 20 to 25 million dollars a year those companies are leaving for other states including Nevada Florida and also going more international the last legal point I'd like to make because I think it's important for you to hear from performers is this idea in this bill of forced consent that performers must be forced to consent to their information and records being made available to the state of California the Department of Industrial Relations forced consent is not consent and the force consent language is in violation of other health and safety codes and it flies in the face of our California Constitution protections for privacy so those those are some of the legal arguments that I'd really like for your committee to consider and to take another look at and not be so swayed by what I would call these kind of emotional arguments but take a look as legislators at these real legal arguments and the legal problems that this bill causes thank you Thank You next witness and opposition mr. chairman and members of the committee thank you so much for hearing my testimony my name is Lorelei Lee I am a performer and director and I have worked in the adult industry for 14 years and I am here today to speak on behalf of the hundreds of performers who oppose this bill I have with me a petition signed by over 500 performers in opposition I also have a statement from the adult sorry the adult performer Advocacy Committee in also stating their opposition to the there are a number of reasons that we oppose this bill the first is has to do with our testing system the system that we have in place right now is one that has been developed for over a decade by performers and medical professionals and that has been extremely effective in the tent last 10 years on adult sets there has not been a single transmission of HIV performers who have tested positive in the last decade have done so after an exposure in their private lives and our protocols have prevented those HIV from being transmitted to anyone else in the adult performer community I want to explain to you what our protocols are right now the way it works is that we performers get tested every 14 days and in order to keep our cast test current we actually end up getting tested about every 10 days for a panel of tests which includes HIV chlamydia gonorrhea syphilis trichomoniasis hepatitis B and hepatitis C our HIV tests that we use is one that many people are unfamiliar with the CDC requirements include the iliza test which is what most people get when they go to a doctor's office or clinic and the iliza test is an antibody test for HIV and analyze a test doesn't show a positive result for up to three to six months after an infection because antibodies don't develop for that time the tests that we use is an antigen test it tests for antigens in your in the blood and has a seven to ten day window between infection and showing a positive result it's a much more sensitive test and this is just one of the tests that we have over over time figured out with cutting-edge because we are our testing protocols are developed by performers and are run by a performer group with performer input and medical input we can react very quickly to changes in technology and student will be using the most advanced testing I don't believe that a government agency is able to react as quickly as we are so I fear that the language in this bill would greatly jeopardize the our testing protocols additionally there's been a question of whether performers are able to hold producers accountable in this testing system Diane who's next to me will explain to you how the system works to protect our privacy and how producers have access to it but I want to make it very clear that performers have a lot of power in terms of enforcing this testing protocol we as a group believe in this very strongly we strongly believe in protecting our own health and the health of our co-workers and so if in the instance a producer decided they wanted to somehow try to work around the system that information would spread very quickly among performers and we would refuse to work for them and we have also a coalition in agencies our agents work in our behalf as well so we do have a lot of power in that situation additionally it's been asked why performers might not not want to use a condom some performers do use condoms and we are not opposed to condom use but some performers have experienced a problem onset when they have used condoms condoms are made for use in people's personal lives where personal encounters last on average 10 minutes or so on set this the physical interactions that we have on set in order to produce a scene often go on for up to two hours that's two hours of friction which is increased by using a condom and performers have experienced something that we call condom rash quite blatantly which is small cuts and tears which can then increase our exposure to other STS in our private lives when we're interacting with people who don't use the rigorous tests that we use in the industry it's also been mentioned other sti's besides HIV are of course very important to think about and I just want to mention that there was a study that came out of Johns Hopkins University analyzing some of the data that's been put forth by the supporters of this bill and showing how that data was deeply flawed and showing that our actual STI rates are comparable to similar communities that if you compare us to the community at large you're comparing us to people who never who rarely test for sti's and so don't even know when they have often when they have a positive result the next thing I want to say is that I'm deeply concerned about the privacy issues in this bill this bill would force me to share my medical information with a government agency and I find that terrifying this bill would set us back by 10 years as performers and would take away our power to choose what we do with our own bodies the actual effect that this law would have would not be to increase condom use in porn we can see in LA County after the passage of measure B which was a similar condom mandate that there was a 95 percent reduction in applications for adult film permits that means larger producers who have the resources will move outside of the jurisdiction of the law in order to keep producing and smaller content producers will shoot illegally when producers are shooting illegally that puts performers at an even greater risk and means that our employers have less accountability now I've been in this industry for 14 years and I know what I can expect on set but the people I'm most concerned about the people who will be made most vulnerable if this bill passes into law our new performers who have not had the benefit of working under these protocols that we have in place already and won't know what they can demand on set thank you so much for listening thank you next witness eirick eirick garden I've been a film editor for over 50 years I moved out here about 39 years ago when it was booming out here and there was a lot of businesses out here I'm an award-winning editor I switch back and forth between the adult industry and the studios like paramount you know United Artists and Universal I have three children that are in the business I work for Playboy Plus and I've only had good experiences and probably more respect that I get at any other businesses where I do work and I've worked for most everybody in the motion picture industry I think we're missing a bigger picture here I think if things last week I resolved with two jobs one in Tennessee because there's a lot of movies being done in Tennessee and they have no people to do the work there one in Atlanta for the same reason and the bigger picture is being forced to take a job in a place like that what happens without families what happens without children what happens without grandchildren I mean how do we connect with our families it breaks apart families and I think that's a really important part of what we're talking about here I think it's more than what what meets the eye they're talking about a few people we're talking about thousands and we're talking about an awful lot of money leaving this state when I came here 39 years ago there was an a lot of money coming into the state and it's not coming in anymore it's going the other way and I see it every day because I was involved with the presidents of most of the studios and I enjoy working in the adult because I'm sure he did a lot different than a lot better but that's moving also and what do I do with my children what would you do if your children were moving at a state how would you see York your children or your grandchildren what are the store owners who own the stores in the malls where were placed like playboy Plus supports ninety percent of the business there what do they do what do they do with their families I I think our industry also I think it allows novices to come in on an entry level position and learn a trade and then go use it the way they choose to in any part of the industry they choose to whether it be adult or whether it be mainstream it teaches people in their 30s and 40s they can learn a trade and do it all so that's another thing that's going to be lost I mean to me it just doesn't make any sense I don't understand that one of the people who wanted to write out a speech for me and I said you know you really don't have to because I've been thinking about this for a long time and it affects more it affects more than a couple of people that say they they were sick I families and breaks up families and breaks up communities and hurts employees in other facets of the business with thousands of people controlling multi millions of dollars and can we afford to lose that it just to me it just makes no sense IRA alcoholic thank you man next witness hi I'm Stuart Waldman I am president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association vikas nasur ghen ization in San Fernando Valley this is an industry in the San Fernando Valley that is a six billion dollar industry it employs numerous people directly and indirectly in the San Fernando Valley you have people who work in mainstream film and then move over the next day to an adult industry film it doesn't matter to them they're collecting a paycheck for the caterer for craft services for the gaffer the grip it doesn't matter it is just filming and by passing this law it would have a chilling effect on these films and it would push films out of this state we are concerned about jobs when you look at the dry cleaner the daycare center anything these are jobs that are paid for and and pay for put money into the economy in the San Fernando Valley and we are hopeful that you will not pass this that you will do the right thing and I just not pass it and keep jobs in California thank you hanging there witnesses in opposition yes my name is Diane Duke and I'm the CEO of the Free Speech Coalition with a trade association for the adult entertainment and pleasure products industry and I'm here to speak in opposition of a bee 1576 it's really a bill in search of a problem we haven't had no onset transmission of HIV in the industry nationwide for over ten years to put this in perspective in LA County alone five new cases of HIV are reported daily that's LA County alone and and our program is nationwide there are some performers speaking earlier today about contracting HIV and that is always tragic and and when and performers just like any other industry or any other people will come there are performers who who may contract HIV in their personal lives the great thing about our program is we're able to stop that at the door our rigorous testing protocols have been able to stop that at the door I want to talk a little bit about this bill and what what it will mean to the state of California we have a little test case of this going on right now in LA County we have a whole year of measure B in LA County and it's a similar bill but not as onerous as as this one is measure B currently the industry is is suing LA County over measure B and the constitutionality of it a majority of it has already been found is unconstitutional the enforcement component of that the very narrow portion the the condom portion is in appeal we had oral arguments last month and we're expecting a decision handed down in six to nine months so you know right that right now that the constitutionality of this issue is it in question but what we have the results we have from measure B are that ninety five percent drop in permit fees in LA County I mean permits in LA County that just in permit fees alone is four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in one year permit fees alone for the drop for measure be the result of measure B we've seen I know of one company that moved out of Chatsworth a twenty five million dollar annual revenue company moved out of Chatsworth to Las Vegas and is now currently shooting in Las Vegas and very successful I've also spoken to a number of other owners of other studios who have said that they will in fact leave California if a statewide measure passes and is and the decision is made that it's that it is unconstitutional and those those are Hustler they're vivid they are brazzers reality King some of our biggest producers who now have jobs six billion dollar industry has said it will move out of California we are being wooed by they're States to come there because we could with us for a week we bring living wage jobs and we bring revenues to the state also I want to talk a little bit about the cost of what this bill will be because we Free Speech Coalition oversees the protocols in the system for pass the passed system is the performer availability screening services and it is the system that sets up then and monitors the protocols for the testing so we do this with a medical advisory group of doctors and we also do this with stakeholders we have performers producers agents all involved in determining the medical doctors are the ones who determine what are the best tests for our performers but the performers have input into it as well as as the producers in the agents to talk about what how we can we can make this process and this program work for everyone involved so we have a pass program where the performer will go to a clinic that has been vetted and has been approved as one of our partnering clinics or testing facilities they will test with the list of protocol tests that we have listed which is as as Lorelei mentioned a vigorous list of tests they will the the facility will then enter in either a clear or not clear available or not available to work which is either a green check or a red X so this this actually protects the performers privacy so when a producer goes on to the system to see if a performers available the producer will seen a green check or a red X green check means the performer has taken the appropriate tests that were required the vigorous test that we talked about the performer has done that in the timeframe that is necessary in order to perform and that the performer has tested clear for all these tests so when you see a green check you know that those cases are are in place if you see a red X you don't know any personal medical information about the performer you just know that that performer is not available for a number of reasons that could be had for a number of reasons but you know that that performer is not available to test now there is no downside for producers using this system it doesn't cost them a penny and performers it doesn't cost anybody a penny we put the system in place it costs a lot to put in place we have doctors who are volunteering it on our Advisory Council we have doctors who work with the testing facilities we have producers who are performers coming together so this this is something that cost a great deal in order for the state to set something like that up if it even possible would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars if not into the millions so I think that that is the cost that has not been been aware I also want to mention that there are a number of other societies that that are supporting this bill the Harvey Milk Democratic Society there's Vikas an umber of other Oh the transgender Law Center thanks Laurie and so there's a lot of folks who are supporting us in our opposition of this bill so I urge you for the state of California for the performers involved and for a very vital industry to vote no on this bill all right is there a public comment I see another witness coming forward you please make it extremely extremely brief q my name is Michael Jada I'm an attorney I represent mine geek USA its producer Playboy plus twisties brazzers and a lot of the more well-known companies we are based out of Burbank we have a seven story building there I just want to touch on a couple of the legal issues that haven't been touched on you know this is a bill about performer safety neither the performers nor others in the industry were consulted about how to ensure performer safety and privacy when this bill was crafted and in the three iterations that have been before this body this paternalistic bill while well-intentioned heart harms both performers the industry and the economy a particular concern to me as an attorney is the constitutional infirmity of the bill the huge privacy issues this bill opens up for the performers and the huge liability that potentially imposes on anyone hoping to do business in California among I'll just touch on a few of these infirmities because there are countless but among them the testing provisions are drafted in a manner to virtually ensure a privacy breach my clients have airtight privacy many of the people who will be subject to this bill are mom and pop producers who are going to be holding performers medical records both online and in file cabinets that is a recipe for disaster and a recipe for litigation it was just a we've heard that already that we've heard that testimony already so if you can if you could wrap it up if you have anything new to add that'd be crazy let me just add one point because this has not been before the policy committees forced consent added two days ago I don't know what that means and how that can exist but in what other industry would we accept forced consent of a worker as a concept thank you very much let's go to public comment in opposition just state your name and where you're from and your position on the bill please I have a couple things that might illuminate that have not been addressed so I'll try not to create a new redundancies here but I'd like to have my voice hear it if that's possible your voice can be heard as long as your voice is brief okay thank you my name is my stage name is Amber chase but my real name is Lillian Getchell and it might appear like I engage in sex indiscriminately however as you've heard we have a big protocol that has been developed but what you don't know is it before I got into the industry I took it upon myself to educate myself in ways that the civilian world just they just don't do I educate myself on all STDs I got vaccinated against hepatitis B and there's no vaccination for see I got vaccinated against meningococcal meningitis and I tried to receive the Gardasil shot that would prove detrimental to my health I've been a performer for seven years I've never received an STD based on the protocol that has been insured to protect us I am over educated I have a BA in art history a BS in anthropology both with minors but more importantly for today's meeting I have a master's in public administration with a minor in rural development international law and I know how important it is for you guys to listen to the people that are here to speak the community that you are regulating I also know that you need to figure out where this money comes from how will you ensure that this mandate is funded when post production procedures might very well edit out the evidence of compliance you can't you can't expect the taxpayers to fund something like this the self-regulated above things like domestic violence elderly care other things like that I don't know where this will come from because I know some of the things that are written in this bill like for the studios and producers having to pay for the two hundred dollar tests for performers to be cleared for performance as a tiny tiny producer as well as a performer I can't pay for other people's tests when I shoot I often film couples in reality porn where they don't use condoms in their own personal life but because we're making this production available to the public to enjoy which it's not sex ed if it were sex ed it would be pornography would be put in fifth and sixth grade classes not because it's for adult entertainment and if you want to educate the public about sexual health and stuff maybe do it like cigarette packs were at the beginning of the pornography we all say I was tested maybe you should be too to know your status because this doesn't address blood-borne pathogens I also got to make sure that all the other people who came a long way can for a big long list of reasons I I thank you all right please again just state your name and where you're from I've been told to state my name I am James Patrick Getchell Patrick J Knight this is forced consent I guess that's all I'm allowed to say good morning committee chair admin my name is Wray Ruchi I'm a performer I am NOT a prostitute I will be a law student in August and I may be serving on the San Francisco civil grand jury I have a number of points against this bill basically prohibition doesn't work the Volstead Act was very well intentioned but it created a lot of havoc in the United States and had to be repealed this bill is it purports to be a safety bill but it's really prohibiting a form of the porn industry that that's very popular bareback porn is basically a concept that drives a lot of the industry people seek these vendors they want to see it a safe consensual realistic sex act that's not related to the way they have sex at home this is this bill if it passes is going to create economic havoc devastating the tax base is going to seriously undermine HIV prevention efforts for example if this bill passes the tax base drops imagine if temp you know I don't mean to interrupt but we've heard that point we would appreciate you making it and thank you so much for being a there's a big line of people who want to speak one more point of wanting to make if I'm sorry I'm sorry there's a long a lot of people who need to be heard we want to make sure that their voices are heard as well so let's go to our next next public comment in opposition thank you thank you hello my stage name is pink and I oppose this bill hello my name is Joshua

feasible three of my three my main three clients have told me that if this bill passes I can either move to wherever they go pack up my children pack up their mother pack up everything and make us all

Donnelly good morning I have a couple of questions on this and none of them are purely into nature so but they're serious because what you're talking about is changing the relationship between an employee and employer and also this bill will have an effect I understand that you have revised it to address the concerns of the far-reaching implications of changing independent contractor status and employees but my main concern now we since you've revised it you've you've addressed that to a certain extent my main concern has to do with this idea of force consent which is a violation of someone's privacy and I don't think that's going to hold up in court and so how do you address that because you you you your bill requires the employer or the company to essentially have access to medical records that can only be given if the consent is given mr. chair if I may Randa Martin again on behalf of the ins Healthcare Foundation unfortunately the opposition is miss reading the language in the bill the consent provision in there is actually there to protect the test subjects the performers it only allows cal/osha to get access to information about whether that person has had a test not the status of the test of the results of the test only that they had a test if the performer consents to releasing that information to the state it does not force them the employers currently under the passed system that Miss Duke very eloquently described here is a good system this bill does not change that system it simply says when you have had the test that test has to be documented so that that the test was taken has to be documented by the adult employer not the results not any of the privacy information of the personal information none of the test results none of that is held by the employer now it will not be held under the provisions of this bill we totally agree with you in terms of privacy I mean we are a major provider of care to people with HIV and AIDS we totally agree we would not do anything to interrupt their privacy we want to protect their privacy we want to make sure that they are consenting to the release of that information before the state of California receives it well I still have serious concerns about the entire idea of the government essentially being this deeply involved in people's private business and the idea that you're going to enforce or mandate something that I don't understand unless you're planning to send enforcement agents to every single set I'm sure some people might enjoy that job but the bottom line is this is a serious thing and if you're going to pass a mandate then it has to be enforced and right now you have an industry that is essentially policing itself there was some pretty good testimony there in terms of the testing that's done and and so I just I have real concerns about this bill and the entire makeup of it thank you and how it will change it and have potential ripple effect from here to the independent contractor status and employee and and whether or not you have control over that and I don't think mr. Donnelly first of all we're we're not dealing with independent contractor versus employee in this bill it has already been ruled through through the courts that they are employees and not independent contractors this bill has nothing to do with independent contractors versus employee or changing one from an independent contractor to employee has nothing to do with wait a minute but the way that the industry works and number of the performers if there's a performer out there that wants to come back up and answer this question I'd appreciate it somebody who's on the opposition side to say that the there are sometimes twelve different companies that they're working for they're not employees of each of those companies they're employees of their own company it was my understanding excuse me chair I remember um I under in my thought process of being an independent contractor I pay for my travel I pay for everything the company doesn't pay for me or my lodging or anything of that nature well kink paid for my flights they paid for my wardrobe they paid for everything I did not spend a single penny they paid me and paid for all of my expenses that makes me an employee now not all companies do that but a lot of companies do do that which can make us employees and on top of the Privacy Act or issue by testing my positive test results were emailed to a John Stagliano who is a director in the industry that I've never met from somebody else in the industry before I even had my test results so therefore my privacy was extremely violated by the so-called pass system so it's fraud very flawed and any other questions comments could we hear from one of the people on the other side sure briefly briefly a contractor status please thank you hi I'm so most most performers are independent contractors there are some occasions where performers do work for only one company and then they become employees but the majority of performers work for a different company every single day they provide their own wardrobe provide their own pay for their own travel there they also pay agency fees they we booked our work through agents oftentimes so do you provide your own health care yes so the health care is not provided by your so-called employer but you provided for yourself absolutely so you are an independent contractor I am NOT but many performers are yes well that that that really is my point and that's my concern and that's why I'm going to be registering a vote against your bill today I appreciate that game all right questions or comments for the panel mr. Bigelow mr. Hall help help me to understand on the testing element side what makes this so distinguishable indifferent to a person who's got a class a driver's license under a class a driver's license you're required to submit to the state every two years a medical affidavit that you are healthy a very lengthy testing and you're also required to have random subjected tests regularly to see if you have any substance inside your body and that all goes to the state but it's all kept very private what makes this any different so it already go so my point is this already exists just basically requires a 14-day testing period but make it mandatory to for a 14-day so that's the difference thank you questions or comments mr. quirk Assemblymember Hall thanks very much for seeing me last night and I have gone through all the material I regretfully cannot support the bill at this time I would support something that makes the current industry standard for testing mandatory but I can't support the rest of the bill my concerns are first of all is a financial question because of the large amount of money that's generated by the industry I do believe it would move out and move underground and I honestly think that currently under the current standard and with the industry located here as the opposition stated with the actress and actors being part of the system I think we are just better off in terms of preventing disease to have it here I have looked at the research papers certainly in 2004 there is good evidence there was transmission of HIV onset there is no comparable study to that the study which talked about chlamydia and other diseases was a flawed study as was stated by the actress who first testified it does not actually have a good number for how many people were actually tested it also has an inflated number for the number of people who were infected because the people it the same person could be tested many times that was used as being many different people coming down with the same number so I just don't see the here at this time thank you mr. Bradford Thank You mr. chair and mr. all I appreciate your effort here my question is more so from the standpoint of enforcement and I was an understanding that it's a responsibility of Cal OSHA to monitor this and I would be more inclined to say they could do it but I just had a hearing two weeks ago as it relates to airport safety and the number of deaths and injuries that have happened at LAX in the last two years and cal/osha testified that they only have two inspectors for the entire Southern California region to police our airports how are they going to do the hundreds if not thousands of movie sets here in Southern California or the state of California they said they only had two inspectors for workplace safety in no entire region if I may mr. chair I'm a mr. Bradford I really appreciate the question and and I I think it underscores the the failure to support Cal OSHA to the extent that it needs to be supported understand two things number one number one Cal OSHA is already enforcing this under their blood-borne pathogen standard they decided several years ago that the blood-borne pathogens standard could be used to enforce the use of condoms and other protection in the adult film industry and they are doing that now nothing in this bill changes that in fact what this bill does is make it easier for them to validate whether it's happening or not because as the bills black-and-white language states it's simply a documentation that the protection is being used and that the testing has occurred the other thing that I would point out relative to Cal OSHA and I'm sure you know there's having heard this a couple of weeks ago to Cal OSHA unlike the Labor Commissioner is a complaint driven process they do not independently go out and investigate they only respond when a complaint is filed with Cal OSHA that an employer is non-compliant with the current regulations at that point they will do a paper study and and do an initial evaluation about whether they need to go out more formal investigation and if they see that there's a reason to do so they will go out and investigate further that's how they deal with the issue of not having enough investigators is is to somewhat triage on what they do but we think that triage is better than nothing that's why I agree but I'm still lost on the documentation and how is it being documented if you state there's no one physically on site other than assigning an affidavit that you had a test which I thought they says it's already in place it's already mandatory testing how will this differ well there are laws in place now some of them federal some of them stay relative to the adult film industry the most common one one we're all aware of is that you have to be 18 years of age or above in order to perform that's under federal law federal law requires that you document that in various ways it will be up to cal/osha in the implementing us to determine how they want this documented but but the fact that they will have to document is all that this bill does if Cal OSHA Cal OSHA will map out whatever obligations the employer has to engage in order to document that protection was used and that tests were taken but it does not allow them to do any more than document that these things have occurred and if I may and candidly if I may so are you saying that this is more properly a candidate for suspense because Cal OSHA would have vast new duties they do not have vascular duties as mr. Hall indicated I appreciate the smile mr. Gatto as mr. Hall indicated at the beginning the bill has been very carefully written to align itself with what Cal OSHA has been doing and the regulations that they have been working on for the last two years there's nothing different in this bill or anything that inconsistent what they're doing now unlike the bill from last year that did create some new new obligations that would have required new regulations okay I don't think mr. Bradford was done yeah you should one follow-up question as it relates to the medical records and whose responsibility would it be to store and house those records would it be the movie producers no and we wouldn't want them to have it it was solely the clinic holds the records but but isn't there an additional cost I mean then how do you cross-reference with the produce I thought it said to produce you had a responsibility to have documentation of the producer is only required to document that the person had a test I mean as Miz Duke who sat next to me described there's a very complicated and successful system now that they call pass and that works very well the only thing that the producer receives is whether the person is available or not available to be tested or to be to be used in the film none of the other information about that person including the test results is allowed to leave the clinic and go over to the employer the employer does not have that information today will not have that information under the bill and would be highly inappropriate for them to have it anyway so the only information they would get is that they are either clear to shoot or they're not clear to see absolutely absolutely questions or comments any other questions or comments from the panel I want to thank mr. Hall for bringing this forward and for those of you who came today on both sides of it I look at this committee as a fiscal committee and not a policy committee and for that reason often times are things I support getting out of this committee and onto the floor at which point I consider whether or not it's a policy that I can support for that reason since obviously our fiscal individuals have not identified as the candidate for suspense exceeding the limit of whatever the financial limits are in this group at the time at the beginning I'm going to support the bill because I really think a lot of the conversation that occurred I probably did occur I assume in the policy committee and at the policy committee of the assembly considered the policy sufficient to move forward and that we're looking at it as a fiscal issue and so I try to restrain my comments in my view to that which is fiscal rather that which may be personal moral or whatever might be and look at it as the fiscal candidate and as a result of that I will support this bill as I did the prior bill based on fiscal standard so thank you very much move the bill second and just on that note I mean you know this this this is a fiscal committee but but obviously we we are free to to look at the issues of whether this will engender a new lawsuits whether this will result in the industry leaving the state in the attendant loss of tax revenue and of course the burdens on cal/osha so just to clarify that any other questions or comments in the piano I have some questions for for the representative from AHF last year we saw a version this bill that was a little different and I commend the author for working so hard to get this underneath the fiscal limit but you represented publicly that this was a non-controversial bill that that there's really no real discussion on HF did and they said that and the committee probably acted in vast you know overriding the members there was no different opinion so I'm sure you're talking about this bill are you talking about another bill I'm talking about this issue this bill yes okay and I would like an answer the question so so they're represented from HF you know is this a non-controversial issue I mean I don't think it's not controversial at all okay I mean with we happen to think from a public health standpoint it's very straightforward you know condoms protect people from getting diseases really clearly I don't think that it's that straightforward I think there's a difference of opinion and and I think that clearly we've heard from some people who are very intelligent including members of this committee on both sides of the issue the other question I have for the represented from HF is I'm you know you have a special tax benefit you're a non-profit the legislature also voted for you an additional tax benefit where you pay no sales tax whatsoever at your thrift stores and I guess the question is and you spent quite a lot of money HF did lobbying this bill last year and actually sending communications that look like political mailers is that something that's within the scope of your nonprofit I have no knowledge about what the law requires or allows under that law okay maybe at some point we can get somebody who does have that knowledge okay any other questions or comments from the panel all right seeing on the bill has been moved and seconded we have requests for a roll call vote from from both sides the members will notice that the analysis has no recommendation I know this is a very controversial issue emotional issue for both sides and so we have not issued a recommendation one way or other in deference to the members this committee and Madam Secretary can call the roll oh you can close I'm sorry I respectfully ask for your aye vote okay you can call the roll Gatto aye Gatto aye Bigelow Bocanegra Bocanegra aye Bradford Calderon call Tyrone aye Campos Campos aye darling don't we know Eggman Eggman aye Gomez Gomez aye Holden Jones Linder Linder no pan pan Ike work crook no really Thomas Wagner Webber Webber aye that bills on call thank you very much mr. Alejo mr. Alejo has a bill on limited liability partnerships we look forward to a discussion I've never thought we'd say that mr. chair that's a hard topic to follow but I'll do my best all right mr. chairman today I'm presenting a B 1645 which expands the current which expands the first current exemption on the minimum franchise tax to include pass-through businesses and extends the exemption to the second taxable year for all qualified businesses as we all know California has the highest one of the highest minimum franchise taxes in the nation and although this bill does not provide all relief for businesses from all sort of costs that they face it is a smart and focused policy that will help create a more business-friendly climate in California the California Chamber of Commerce has labeled a B 1645 a job creator as it will put money back into the pockets of entrepreneurs that invest in our state's economy my office has been working with this committee the Cal chamber the Franchise Tax Board to reduce the cost of this bill by limited to corporations doing business in the state targeting those most likely to invest here additionally I'm offering the committee several options to further limit the cost by up to 90 million dollars by as estimated by the FT B and those options are either adding a five-year sunset provision or replacing the second year exemption with the reduction in the minimum franchise tax from $800 to $400 I look forward to working with the chair and your exemplary staff to find an acceptable compromise I respectfully ask for your aye vote and I have some witnesses to speak in support sure first witness thank you good morning mr. chair and committee members Jennifer Barrera behalf the California Chamber of Commerce and we are in support of this measure and have identified it as a job creator this year while we certainly would like a broader exemption to the minimum franchise tax we appreciate the author's attempt to address the fiscal concerns through the proposed amendments and we would ask for your support and considering this when it comes to the suspense file thank you thank you much any other witnesses in support witnesses in opposition Department of Finance mr. chair members finances opposed because results in significant general fund or revenue losses questions or comments from the panel thank you very much mr. chairman thank you very much you mean my exemplary staff will work with you on suspense all right mr. Patterson Thank You mr. chairman and members a b25 19 an axe a 15 percent non-refundable Tax Credit that will help make vocational schooling affordable for California students and families the bill encourages and rewards students who are preparing to earn a living in some of California's most critical professions like nurses physician assistants dental hygienists pharmacy technicians radiology technicians paralegals auto mechanics and others a b25 19 opens the door to prosperity for families by removing the barriers to that affordability and opens the door to launching them into lifelong careers and in good-paying jobs for students across our states the 15% non-refundable tax credit although having some cost to the state and I recognize that this is a suspense candidate I would merely point out that the incentive and the opportunities provided for these individuals to learn a trade and to be licensed and gainfully employed opens the door for them to be not only lifelong individuals employed in the state of California but lifelong taxpayers as well which I believe will be a net benefit to the finances of the state of California I did take the following amendments in the Committee on revenue and Taxation which have significantly reduced the cost of this measure they include first we reduced the credit to 15% and implemented a $2,500 cap as well as a five-year sunset date second we addressed concerns about potential double dipping by making employers who already write-off education expenses ineligible for this particular credit and finally students who already use tax exam funds from a Golden State scholarship account to fund their vocational schooling will not be eligible for this credit as well which should further reduce the overall costs should a b25 19 be approved and finally I appreciate all of the work on this by the committee as well as the valuable input and the technical amendments we've received from the Franchise Tax Board throughout this process and I ask for your support in moving this bill forward at Friday's suspense hearing mr. chairman and members thank you for the opportunity to present the bill of course are there any witnesses in support or opposition I don't see any Department of Finance mr. chair and members finance is opposed to this bill on the bill results in significant general fund revenue losses FTB is estimated around 100 million dollars annually we also note there are various workforce development programs in place to address the need i'm stated in this bill including those funded by the state's employment training panel which provides funding to employers to assist in upgrading the skills of their workers through training that leads to good-paying long-term jobs thank you question comes from the panel all right we will work with you during the suspense process thank you much okay next we have mr. Nazarian mr. Nazarian you have three bills before us you have 15 10 20 299 and 2700 all our candidates for suspense are you waiting on any yes on 15 10 and 20 299 I'm only presenting on 2700 the floors yours Thank You mr. chair and members just as a quick background in February of 2009 the California film and television tax credit program was enacted to promote production spending jobs and tax revenues in California however the current California film tax credit focuses on actual shooting days of the qualified film and there's no current minimum requirement on post-production cost to be spent or done in California consequently there is no incentive for visual effects and post-production studios to stay and do business in the Golden State in response this bill will create a 15 million dollar per year incentive program as proposed to be amended that specifically targets post-production spending competition for the post-production industry is fierce New York England Canada have established a thriving program to boost post production and have developed local clusters of employment in digital and visual effects California visual effects companies face rising costs increased under bidding for services and pressure from non California incentives on their bottom line recent media reports and data compiled by the post New York Alliance shows a major increase in business growth in New York nearly 100 new post production applicants and 10 new post production companies have established new operations at the same time the Milken Institute notes of 43 percent decrease in post production jobs from 15,000 252 in 1996 to 8700 34 in 2003 since then and in 2010 California had closed 10,000 post production jobs had close to 10,000 post production jobs additionally we have seen post production companies either flee the state for other incentives or have gone bankrupt such companies including rhythm Hieu Studios most famous for its work on the life of Pi and Digital Domain this poll encompasses an important sector of the entertainment industry that currently does not directly benefit from the California film tax credit program it is imperative that we incentivize post-production work and preserve the viability of post-production industry in California with that I thank you for your time and ask for your consideration and support do you have any witnesses in support I do not I don't believe so no any witnesses in opposition Department of Finance no file on this mr. chair any questions from the members this bill is a candidate for suspense at this time Thank You mr. Nazarian mr. guru L you you have a B 23:23 the floor is yours Thank You mr. chair members of the committee good morning good afternoon I'm not sure where we are good morning I'm pleased to present a B 23:23 which will provide a modest tax break to California's Olympic and Paralympic athletes move the bill this bill exempt income tax for the value of any awards won by Olympians at the Olympic Games or any cash awards provided by the US Olympic Committee this exemption does not include sponsorship deals or endorsements of any kind or any other income outside of this award of a medal most countries compensate their Olympic athletes but athletes be representing the United States do so without compensation until or unless they win a medal where after they are awarded a modest honorarium upon being welcomed home American athletes who win a medal wearing the red white and blue of our nation's Olympic uniform are then subject to federal and state taxes on these achievements and these are achievements that are made on behalf of you me and the United States of America in addition to the physical metals earned by Olympic athletes finishing 1st 2nd or 3rd in their respective events the Olympic US US Olympic Committee which receives no government funding provides honoraria to the meddling athletes this honor area and the value of these medals are assessed tax by the state of California while some of our athletes enjoy financial success as a result of their participation in the Olympic Games this is by no means universally true many make considerable financial sacrifices to train and to participate in the games some some of them live very modest lives indeed we had some testimony before the last committee by Stephanie trapped in she is a gold medalist and and participates in the discus event she spends hundreds of hours after now competing in the Olympics she spends hundreds of hours mentoring young people talking to schools volunteering twice a week every week at Sac State to help support their program athletic program there she does that all as a volunteer and as a representative of the US government and as a gold medalist for the Olympics conforming legislation is currently pending at the federal level in both the House and the Senate a bipartisan delegation of US senators introduced various bills and these exemptions at the federal level are also being considered California is in a unique position to take a leadership to take leadership in this effort as home to the nation's highest concentration of Olympic and Paralympic athletes California is one of the sites of many Olympic Committee's three olympic training centers one in being in Chula Chula Vista these athletes have dedicated their lives and their craft to representing our state and our nation our athletes were received no government backing unlike those in other countries and the least we can do as a state as a nation to honor their sacrifice to these athletes is a small tax break on the achievement they earn and the enormous sacrifice they make earn them a B 23:23 was amended in the assembly committee on rev and tax on may 13th to include a sunset date of December 31st 2021 this bill is supported by the US Olympic Committee and many u.s. athletes who have competed in the in the Olympic Games I respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you I think you very much do it witnesses in support witnesses in opposition Department of Finance no file on this mr. chairman questions or comments from the panel seeing none I was out of the room has a bill has been properly moved and seconded and it is out on an a roll call thank you much thank you mr. Morici good morning you have Assembly Bill 2188 which enjoys a do pass recommendation yes thank you a b2 to 188 is designed to streamline the permitting and inspection process for small residential rooftop solar systems that meet certain building and safety standards move the bill this bill is good for jobs good for business and good for the environment as the committee analysis states there will be negligible negligible fiscal impact of the state and cities and counties can recoup their costs through fees we are continuing to work with stakeholders to address their concerns I respectfully ask for your aye vote let's go to witnesses in support mr. chairman my name is Bernadette Dell Kira on the executive director of the California Solar Energy Industries Association we are here in strong support of this bill I will keep my comments brief given the late hour but just in in in summary thanks to the actions of this legislature the industry for solar the number of homeowners in particular going solar in California is skyrocketing it's increasing dramatically thanks to that industry growth the the industry is been able to really reduce our costs on hardware and we've reduced our prices and also and really make basically these systems quite cookie-cutter and simple to install what this bill would do is it would have the permitting system for those systems basically catch up with the technology would make it streamlined would help us reduce our costs while also saving cities money and reducing the amount of time that cities have to spend with solar permits with the experience of the cities that have adopted expedited permitting is that they actually can provide a better service to their other permitted trades as well as to solar and with that we ask that you pass this bill thank you thank you very much next witness as hi my name is William Stewart I'm president of solar craft we a company in the North Bay we've been in business for 30 years the majority of solar permits we pull are are extremely simple they are flush mounted on a roof they all go within the CalFire guidelines so we're looking for a streamlined process for those permits which probably represent about 3/4 of the ones we pull we don't expect this to apply to those that fall outside of that that may need a variance of some type that are ground mounted that are mounted up off of the roof but again the majority are very simple permits and almost all the jurisdictions we work in have a very simple process and it is fairly quick but there are several that are very difficult and we feel like it could be standardized and streamlines to everyone's benefit all right let's go to public comment and support Kate Bell on behalf of Solar City and also see our trade association in support Thank You mr. chair and members mark Fenster maker here on behalf of SunRun in support thank you chairman members Rachael O'Brien a behalf of the California center for sustainable energy were in strong support other witnesses in opposition please come forward good morning mr. chair members Jason lying League California cities however either the analysis does suggest there are no direct state costs we and serving our membership strongly believe that there are significant City costs to this measure County cost to this measure that will be passed on to the consumer I think the goal of the industry is to you know lower the costs unfortunately I think the unintended consequences of this bill will be significantly higher permit fees if you look at the measure there are a number of new requirements some 15 17 new requirements they're going to be costly and for those jurisdictions that do not want to subsidize that activity they're going to have to pass it on to the consumer and I think the very jurisdictions that the supporters are looking to convince to expedite this process will be the jurisdictions that will increase their fees the most so unfortunately at this time we must oppose this measure Thank You next witness good want to cure Ross on behalf of the cities of Sacramento Riverside Santa Rosa and the Marin County Council of mayors and council members we would echo the concerns of the league we're very concerned especially in our communities that have done a lot to make solar be very low cost to their community that this will actually create new costs and unintended impacts thank you thank you let's go to I'm sorry next witness Thank You mr. chairman Gil topd with the California municipal utilities Association also opposed some who seemingly members play a role in the overall process for permit approval but the bills not only about permit expiration it's about creating a checklist it's about an application process that's commensurate with the checklists these are other items that for large County small counties this is this is one single product the solar panel product of many products that have to go through a permit process singing out one product seems a little bit on a practice for localities that might have various ways of processes to issue permits and it none of them deny solar power panels they just take time specific to the needs of each locality to issue those permits thank you thank you let's go to public comment in opposition behalf of the California fire chiefs to let you know the fire service is not opposed to solar we know that it's there we're working around it we're building training programs to deal with these rooftop systems as well as the ground mounted systems the issue that we have with this bill is the permitting process in and of itself as mentioned earlier many of these systems are built in compliance with the guidelines that were originally presented by the State Fire Marshal's Office originally developed by Los Angeles City Fire Department many of those requirements have been brought forth into the California fire code through a consensus process this bill eliminates the fire authorities ability to review this permit it only allows at this point for review by the building official that also limits the amount of inspections that occur doesn't allow for the fire service to go out and inspect those systems as needed in some cases that's fine you know if you have a good working relationship with your building officials I for one have that relationship however there's many special districts in this state that don't Orange County Fire Authority is one an example that has I think some you know 10 or 15 city building departments that they have to work with so there's there's a lot of things that need to be done and we're asking for a no vote give us the ability to work with these systems to provide for that firefighter safety as well as Public Safety thank you thank you any other public comment in opposition please just state your name and Kelly Jeffery with the California Building officials we were opposed to this bill for financial and policy reasons thank you are there questions well let's go to Department of Finance first no position on this bill mr. chair from PUC indicates no fiscal impact we do note any local governments do not have sufficient authority to cover all the costs imposed by the bill that could result in a reimbursable state mandate thank you questions comes from the panel mr. Portman Assemblymember Marissa a thank you for bringing this bill forward do you wish to address the comment by the people concerned about coordination with fire yes so clearly well number one let me emphasize that there are cities and counties that are already implementing this you know what we're trying to accomplish with this bill they've streamlined the permitting and inspection process they've the city of Los Angeles the County of San Diego in particular are seen as model programs in terms of significantly kind of cutting down on permit wait times inspection wait times while maintaining these important public health and safety standards in terms of there's nothing in the bill that that prevents or prohibits fire inspections from occurring obviously we don't want to do enact anything that's going to threat threaten or undermine public health and safety standards the the bill allows for the the five-day inspection to take place the inspection can be conducted either with building officials and/or files of fire safety safety inspection officials but again I want to emphasize that there's nothing in this bill that prevents or should undermine or inhibit the participation of adequate fire inspection so there is one part of the fire inspection actually it's a requirement and that is that the firefighters be able to chop through your roof and they want to make sure that there is places in the roof where they can when fighting a fire gets through the roof does your bill contain the ability for the fire departments to require that can that be part of the streamlined process yes so this bill calls upon cities to come up with their own checklists and in in their own checklists they can ensure that their there are checkboxes for things like the three-foot setback for fire the firefighters to be able to access rooftops there the cities can put on their checklist the requirement for metal conduits for for the wiring to protect firefighters when they have to fight fires and go on rooftops so again you know that this bill addresses is is is trying to work with cities and counties it raises the issue of local control but I want to emphasize that the cities and counties you know retain the ability to be able to define what goes into the checklists including ensuring that adequate fire and building safety standards are included on the checklist okay finally then I happen to put in solar shingles it took the city of Hayward about two months to do to get through that because they hadn't seen a solar shingle before only solar panels were you bill encompass show solar shingles this is a thin film technology you end up with a single that looks much like a like you end up with basically shaped something that looks like a shingle very much but is actually a solar device firefighters can get through that so there's no reason to have the the three-foot margins that took us a while to get that done if it's not in the bill yet I just urge you to look at that we look at streamlining giving a model bill to streamline that process as well thank you thank you okay so just to clarify this bill does not address solar shingles all right well perhaps in a later version and again thank you very much you've done a lot I think to to take care of some of the problems city had such as the three-day approval you've also allowed cities if they can't do the five-day inspection to say so for those reasons for the great work you've done I'll certainly be supporting your bill Thank You mr. Bocanegra to the author I just wanted to you and I talked a little bit about this bill I am prepared to support it today because its fiscal committee however I just want to be on record that there are some concerns on behalf of the building and safety department from the city that I'm from as well as the DWP which are still looking at this issue I've got 80 applications for solar projects in my district not all of them are rooftops I really have a concern about on ground projects because a few of them don't fit with the existing character of the neighborhood and I'm so I'm contemplating not supporting those projects back home in my district but for now I'm supportive continue to work with you and I hope that if I have any substantive matters of policy that from from my city I can come to you and work with you on this bill thank you and if I may just real quickly this bill passed on a 7 o vote out of the policy committee we've addressed many of the the building and safety concerns and we will continue to do so all right if I may take that as your closed unless there's anything else I respectfully ask for aye thank you very much Bill's been properly moved and seconded is out on an a roll call with compos Linder and Wagner not voting thank you very much thank you all right miss Weber would you like to present on your suspense item yeah sure yeah mr.

Linder voting aye thank you mr. Jones mr. Jones has Assembly Bill 1863 which enjoys a do pass recommendation mr. chairmembers thank you please please state what the bill does I will certainly do that a B 1863 passed with bipartisan support of the Human Services Committee where the Simeon members Calderon Cooley and Hall asking to come on as co-authors it is an important consumer protection bill which will ensure that caregivers providing an in-home services in those agencies referring these workers meet appropriate standards across the industry this bill is an extension of a B 1217 Assemblymember Lowenthal's bill from last year which licensed and regulated home care organizations and created standards for workers they employ to provide home care a B 1863 will license and regulate homecare referral agencies in a way that not only protects consumers who need a home care worker but also works for their business model in not running afoul of the IRS and EDD laws through the bill if that applies and of independent contractors and agencies that refer to these workers thank you for the third and the fourth I appreciate it alright let's go to your first witness and support Kathryn Reese representing the network of domestic referral agencies given the motions in seconds I shan't testify thank you there is opposition to the bill I should let you know that we we have looked at some of their issues and feel there's room to

thinks Tony Williams with inspired senior living options we are a home care referral agency located in Marin and San Francisco and we support this bill Matt McQueen llaman owner of 1+1 senior care in Santa Clara County domestic referral agency I support this bill I'm Judy Horvath owner and director of Tenderheart home care out of San Ramon California covering Alameda and Contra Costa County and I strongly support this bill okay let's go to witnesses in opposition good morning I'm Jennifer Cavazos with the California Association for Health Services at home we represent hospice home health and home care agencies we represent the home care agencies that act as the employer that were licensed under a be 12:17 last year the state is currently struggling with implementation of a B 1217 in they've actually introduced trailer bill language to delay implementation for one year this bill seeks to expand the licensing statue and add a new category of essentially homecare brokers that are currently governed under the Civil Code to the licensing statute that will be governed by the Department of Social Services that bill set up a framework for licensing at the employer model and developed a registry of home care aides that requires a background check to be completed and for the department to maintain a list of aides that have gone through that process that includes a department of social services managed background check and a TB test for them to be employed we question the necessity of the bill to license agencies that are already covered under the Civil Code there's nothing in a B 1217 that bars a domestic referral agency from developing a business plan to only refer refer aged two families or broker them out to families based on that existing list we do have an oppose unless amended position or amendments seek to add consumer protections regarding liabilities that can't exist when they utilize an aid from a referral agency civil code currently acquires that domestic referral agency state that the family may have employer obligations and it's our amendment seek to strengthen the disclosure requirements to families by requiring a statement be issued that stipulates how but monies have been received and how they've been disbursed from the trust account on a monthly basis to families when you think about it you do have the opportunity to receive consumer warnings and protections and different ways and we think that when a family is bringing somebody into their home to provide care to a loved one with Alzheimer's disease that needs assistance with activities of daily living and IDL's that the most highest level of protection should be included including that any potential financial risk that they may have because when a family uses an aid there are employer requirements that they could fall under and if they aren't aware of those disclosures if that is not fully disclosed to them then the families can be looking at wage claims and workers comp claims against them and their their limited financial resources and so we strongly we will continue to work and negotiate with the author on on the consumer protections that were seeking we also have concerns with the bill as it was amended in Human Services because it limits the ability of a registered aide to work both directly for a family and through an employment agency at the same time and we think that they should have the choice to work for whomever they want when they'd like to thank you next witness good afternoon Angela Blanchard here on behalf of res care one of the nation's largest providers of services to seniors and persons with disabilities we want to echo the comments of our colleague and look forward to working with the author on our outstanding concerns thank you thank you any public comments in opposition Department of Finance I know position on this we do note the bill may result in additional workload for Social Services to do
