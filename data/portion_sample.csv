because we're hoping we get that information before the end of the day thank you um with that we will open up thank you the um uh the hearing and a possible work session on 40 73 and 41 15. so do you want to give us the measure yes members of the committee hospital 4073 and house bill 4114 touch on the same subject matter house bill 4073 expands the applicability of laws governing miners access to possession and use of tobacco products to include vapor products hospital 4115 expands the applicability of laws governing miners access to possession and use of tobacco products to include vapor products it also extends the applicability of laws governing adult use of tobacco products in public places to include vapor products meaning uh oregon clean indoor air act public meetings places of employment hospitals expands to prohibition against smoking and motor vehicles with a child present to include vaping declares an emergency and is effective on passage great thank you very much uh representative olsen and is representative barnhart here yes yes oh grace thank you representative will you come up and talk about your bill welcome to our committee representative uh thank you madam chair my name is phil barnhart i'm the state representative from house district 11. and i thought we were going to have uh ledge council come and explain some of the differences and he's right there why don't we have and it would be wonderful if you could do that before i give my test sure that would be great [Music] uh charitome representative uh olsen uh vice chair gomberg excuse me if my voice is a little uh cracking i got a little bit of a sore throat today so thank you um so i was asked to come down and briefly describe the drafting process for the bills as well as the distinct differences between the two because they are very similar and because of certain issues that have arise since the drafting state your name for the record please uh excuse me the name for the record is mark mayer from alleged counsel thank you so both bills do two things with respect to vapor products as well as statutes that currently prohibit the use and consumption of tobacco products by minors they both define vapor product the definitions are very similar i'll go over that in just a minute and they both update statutes related to the consumption and exposure of tobacco products by miners so that those statutes equally apply to vapor products house bill 4115 also as the summary was just read updates those statutes related to the use of tobacco products in public places so they also equally apply to vapor products and that would be the major distinction between the two it was mentioned that i should just or it was requested that i should mention that in preparing the bills i did look at every statute that contains the terms tobacco product tobacco cigarette and smoking in order to ensure that we would update all the appropriate statutes statutes that were not added to the bill and not amended into the bill were either unrelated to the subject matter and in some cases they were they involved programs that involved the uh that involved federal monies and we didn't want to amend those statutes for obvious reasons didn't want to jeopardize any kind of funding mechanism [Music] and finally it was requested that i mentioned that none of the statutes are amended in any way except for the fact that they add vapor products so that the statute equally applies there are no other substantive changes in these bills as you can see if you just read through it and then finally it was requested that i go through the definition for vapor product i think as most people here know if the court needs to discern legislative intent it's going to use the pge and state versus gains rubric in order to look at legislative intent under that methodology the court is going to look at the plain meaning of the text and the context of the statute first and then it will look at the legislative record [Music] plain meaning will be discerned by looking to the dictionary in order to discern what the legislature meant when it incorporated certain words into the text of a statute so the first in both bills vapor product has two meaning meanings first vapor product is an electronic device designed to heat nicotine solutions and other solutions for the purpose of producing a vapor to be inhaled by the user of the device second a vapor product is a nicotine solution in any form designed to be used with such a device there's an important caveat there involving a dash one amendment which i'll discuss at the very end of my testimony so if you look at the dictionary you look at the components of the definition design means to have as a purpose or to or to devise for a specific function or end solution means a homogeneous mixture not necessarily liquid vapor means diffused matter and so if you kind of string these different definitions together you could come up with vapor product is an electronic device that has as its purpose the heating of homogeneous mixtures including homogeneous nicotine mixtures for the purpose of producing diffused matter to be inhaled thank you representative olsen and then for the second piece of the definition for both bills a vapor product is also the nicotine solution itself that you use with the device now the dash one amendments to house bill 4115 they remove the nicotine components of that definition so it would a vapor product would then be any solution that you use with the device that was an important distinction that representative barnhart wanted me to make about the dash ones [Music] is there anything else chair tell me any questions of ledge counsel thank you so much for coming would you stay in the audience please in case other questions you come up can you do that yeah i appreciate that thank you very much is that exactly yes thank you madam chair and i appreciate the uh the distinction because i think it's important for the committee to understand uh this distinction between the two bills and i will say that we have been working hard trying to write a bill that is simple in its effect even though it gets fairly complex in the drafting because of the way in which our tobacco laws are scattered uh throughout through the statutes and so really what this bill does is it catches up to the technology that's already uh in place in our society it doesn't break any new ground it simply applies the rules we already have to smoking to these new products that other people have told me are not covered by our existing statute even though the many of the effects are the same now the key difference i think between these these two bills is that while both bills restrict the sale to miners actually prohibit the sale to miners the the 40 uh 4115 also prohibits the use of these devices and the solutions that you that you heat in them in places where smoking is not permitted now so it's easy to apply uh public health officials have told us that one of the biggest benefits of this bill is uh the addition to the clean air act because it would reduce the behavior of modeling to young adults very young and and children when we i think everyone in this room agrees that we should not encourage or provide for smoking or the use of these products by adolescents and the young adults to the extent that we possibly can manage that because of the addictive nature of the substances because we're dealing with growing brains because we're dealing with growing bodies and they these uh young people are particularly susceptible to the uh to the uh addiction process that takes place the other things that we know about the addictive addictive process is that it isn't simply the a prohibition that works what works are a whole constellation of things one of which is the the lack of an of a normative uh situation that allows people to see the use of these products in normal situations uh and and which therefore would encourage them to think this is cool this is wonderful this is something i'll get involved in the reality is that anyone who wants cigarettes can find them even despite the fact that it's illegal for young people to get them or use them anyone young people if they want them can find e-cigarettes the task for the legislature and the task for our society as a whole is to prevent the addictive process by doing a whole bunch of other things one of which is covered particularly by this bill 4115 data analyzed by the center for disease control and prevention show that the number of adult americans who have used e-cigarettes has quadrupled from 2009 to 2010 it also showed that from the national youth tobacco survey that e-cigarette use doubled among middle and high school students in two thousand eleven two thousand twelve uh nicotine harm reduction should also be questioned as these e-cigarettes perpetuate the use of nicotine by allowing users and tobacco smokers to get from one cigarette to the next when tobacco users might otherwise quit you use cigarettes in the morning at work you use e-cigarettes at the restaurant you use e-cigarettes that they hold at the waiting room at the airport you use e-cigarettes and then you can get back to your regular smoke once you get home at night and so we're perpetuating uh the use of these these devices additionally false claims of safety have enticed those who have already quit to start again i had a conversation just last week with somebody who told me that they used to smoke cigarettes that they had stopped and had not used nicotine at all for a time and then began using it again uh believing that e-cigarettes were safe the health impacts of these devices represent i just want to clarify you're saying that that person started using e-cigarettes and yes after having stopped using regular cigarettes for a period of time um and so these these are beguiling uh devices that uh that we do not want to encourage as a matter of public policy uh and i think the other the other obvious end point has to do with the health impact not just on the person who's using them but also on everybody else in the area the reason why we have the oregon indoor clean air act is to protect uh third parties people are second parties i guess people who are not using uh these materials from being exposed to them directly people at work people in classrooms who are there to study people in the airport waiting room waiting to get on an airplane and have to be there because that's where they have to be in order to get on the airplane and on and on and on these devices have chemicals that can negatively affect our quality for non-users imagine yourself in one of these places that i mentioned people believe that e-cigarettes are safe alternative to smoking partly because the advertising that's been done by uh tobacco companies and others although the food and drug administration has warned that e-cigarettes contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze close quote the nicotine effects i think are pretty obvious and i could go into those in in detail but i'll simply say that the december 19 2013 just a couple of months ago a study from roswell park one of the one of the uh respected cancer one of the most respected cancer institutes in the world talks about the nicotine effects on blood pressure heart rate vasoconstriction of blood vessel damage stress adverse effects on the brain and lung development in children the effect on pregnant women with the increased risk of babies born with birth defects and on and on and on some of these at least can be mitigated for people who do not use these products directly by restricting them by restricting the use to areas other than the ones that we regularly post as non-smoking you're going to hear some things about how you'll probably hear some things today about how these products can be used in tobacco harm reduction i urge very clear caution as you look listen to this testimony and as you look at it no e-cigarette has been approved by the fda for therapeutic use if companies wanted to submit them for evaluation for therapeutic use they could but today not one e-cigarette company has chosen to go through the steps to be regulated as a tobacco cessation product in 2009 the oregon attorney general successfully sued two companies sotera and smoking everywhere notice the name because they were marketing their products as safe in general and safer than conventional cigarettes but neither of these businesses was able to show was able to substantiate their claims in fact there was no indication that these were not harmful that they did not have harmful carcinogenic agreements they were free of tar and other chemical substances that are produced in traditional cigarettes lab testing by the fda found that tobacco-specific nitrosamines which are known carcinogens in humans were found they also tested for ethylene glycol ingredient used in antifreeze as i mentioned earlier known to be highly toxic to humans and they found these substances the stipulated judgment that the attorney general uh was able to obtain announcement remember stipulated judgment means that the company agreed to it with smoking everywhere included in express admission by the company that they'd violated oregon's unlawful trade practices act and they paid ninety five thousand dollars to the department my suspicion is to pay for the departmental costs and prosecuting them um uh smoking everywhere and sotera were permanently borrowed from doing business in the in the state as a result of these claims i would also note that there's very strong support around the state benton county classic county deschutes county hood river county and umatilla county have already passed smoke-free policies that explicitly include e-cigarettes from the standpoint of of uniformity it's important to also ban the use of these devices for other substances in the first place we know that it's very easy to mix any number of flavorings one of the companies we interviewed that indicate they have 300 different products which contain all kinds of different scents or flavorings and any of them can be mixed with nicotine to to whatever level that you would like so the only way you can actually control uh these devices in non-smoking areas is not only to ban the nicotine substance but also any other substance so in effect what you're doing is banning the use of the device in a non-smoking area also do for the same reason the sale to miners need to include the the devices and all of the different things that are designed to be used to burn in those products some of them are in cartridges some of them come in a little bottle with a with a stopper and a uh and an eyedropper to place on the on the burning element in the in the device there they come in a variety of different ways i suggest that the definition we have chosen here is designed not only to apply to the the e-cigarettes that are available today but also the ones that are likely to be developed in the future as tobacco companies and others engage us in an arms race to get around our rules it's very important to understand that their business model demands they won't say this but it's clear their business model demands that they are able to addict a certain percentage to victimize a certain percentage of our young people every year in order to stay in business long term people who don't start using these products until their age 22 or 23 never become addicts or almost almost never become addicts it's important for them to work on the younger people if we allow the use of these devices in non-smoking areas not only do we expose everyone else as a victim to these devices but we also make it normative for kids to do that now i want to say one of the things this bill does not do i've heard around the room the building and so have you about people who have been smoking all their lives and all of a sudden they've discovered these devices and then now they're starting to use them instead and anecdotally they'll tell you that they feel better and they don't cough as much and those kinds of things i'll point out that the studies that have been done in this area are purely anecdotal at this point we don't have any good studies that demonstrate this actually actually leads to health improvement and of course they're still addicted to nicotine but this bill does not restrict them from using e-cigarettes it doesn't restrict the sale of e-cigarettes or the chemical or the material that goes in them to adults adults can still do that if you are a chain smoker and you want to reduce your smoke your the the uh the other materials that go into your lungs and you want to try using e-cigarettes to do that you can do that i will point out to those who are sitting behind me who may be tempted to do that there's no evidence that we know now that suggest this actually helps people to stop using nicotine but if you wanted to do it this bill doesn't prevent you from doing that all it does is that the people who cannot smoke now in no smoking areas would also not be allowed to use these devices in those smoking areas madam chair members of the committee i urge you to adopt this this bill and sent and send it on to the floor and then to the senate this bill has an emergency clause the numbers of of uh shops that sell these materials there were there were six shops in before 2009 and now there are 87 [Music] that sell that sell primarily these kinds of of devices and the substance making mixing the substances that go in them seven shops were registered with the secretary of state last month in january it is important to get this done now to get it done quickly every month we wait adds to the number of young addicts young victims of of these substances every month we wait so it's important to get it done now thank you madam charlotte thank you thank you i'm ready to answer any questions any quick questions we need to move on because we have a lot of people who signed up to testify any quick questions okay we may i think we won't be passing any legislation today baby but if we need to we'll be calling you back representatives thank you i appreciate that very much [Music] can people stay after we're supposed to go until 4 45 can you stay until five i think no i really don't want you everybody but representatives um but if you could that would be great because a lot of people have traveled a long ways to be here and we haven't heard anything more about the manufactured home madam chair members of the committee hospital 4038 is still no okay but okay uh house bill 4028 in the meantime has received an indeterminate fiscal so it's ready anytime for a worker okay great thank you thank you madam chair and committee members my name is andy olsen and i'm state representative from the albany area i do want to talk to you about house bill 4073 which is electronic cigarettes to minors bill um i'm going to kind of just briefly go through the testimony i have that you have in front of you here but many of you know that last year the state of washington along with 12 other states passed the legislation that dealt with electronic cigarettes being known as e-cigarettes to miners and what this bill here 4073 does and would join 28 other states basically would just prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes to miners that's that's how simple this is i do i have some uh individuals who are behind me that are i would love to have share with you a little bit some examples of what the machine itself is justin newman i think and some others might be coming up but also there are some others too since uh represent barnhart he alluded to the issue about no evidence for what the impact of changing from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes creates for health there are some members that are here that will tell you personal life stories what it has done for them now what what are e-cigarettes e-cigarettes are a battery battery operated product designed to deliver nicotine to user by heating liquid nicotine derived from tobacco plants along with flavors and other chemicals into a vapor that the user inhales as reported by the u.s surgeon general and u.s department of health and human services the nicotine found in e-cigarettes is highly addictive has immediate biochemical effects on the brain and body at any dosage and is toxic to the high doses so i mean if you kind of get why it's kind of important to move forward to want to prohibit this you should also know that of the individuals that are retailers around the state that i have had conversation with regarding this celsius they have already created a personal policy of their own not to sell to minors so you know and i really appreciate that effort from them and and their consideration for that they'll be coming here and they'll be supporting what this bill is all about so yeah you can read the rest of what i have there i think my bill 4073 is fairly simple and it's one of those things that we need to move on quickly with it does create a violation i mean it moves it into the portion of the statute which is on this third page that deals with violations and for endangering the welfare of a minor it makes a classy violation all right thank you questions yes represented thank you madam chair uh representative olson thank you for your testimony today and i apologize for not getting you this question in advance but i think you have a unique perspective on this one particular subject area we recently passed legislation that prohibits people from smoking in cars with children present and with your police background i'm wondering if you might be able to comment on how an officer might be able to tell the difference between currently illegal smoking in vehicles versus currently legal smoking of electronic cigarettes that appear the same that's really that's a great question ma'am chair and representative gomberg great question uh for one thing the folks that are going to be coming up and testifying for me and the example the there are no studies about the impact of what the vapor or just that small moment of what that creates versus that of secondary hand smoke you know it does uh and which you can easily detect inside a motor vehicle in that compressed compartment um i mean i i've had the opportunity to witness and experience the vapor itself it doesn't stay long so i'm a crucial piece is you're going to have to determine whether or not in fact you know that did occur and then here's the other thing you're going to have to consider was there any nicotine in the the substance itself because a lot of people are not using nicotine as they purchase them you're going to hear that excuse me man of chair sheriff i can just restate my question because i just want to make sure they represent understand a police officer from a reasonable distance can they tell the difference when they're observing a vehicle go by no no that's that's really difficult see you're going to have to be you know basically in a situation like that you're going to almost have to be side by side traveling down a multiple lane road to see that thank you any other questions thank you representative olson we have a lot of people and um who are signed up to testify um [Music] several people are supportive of representative olson's bill i don't think anybody has testified or is interested in testifying against it we have several people who are more than 100 miles away and i would remind you that that would be maybe roseburg i mean eugene would only be 50 miles south and so we're talking probably about roseburg somebody can help me and so our state of policy is to invite people to come up who are 100 miles or more away because we'll hear as many people as we can and i will stay here and probably representative olsen as long as it takes to have make sure everybody who is here to sign up will have a chance to testify venture if if i may uh one of the first people i think uh folks justin north newman would be a really good one to have a first he's from eugene even though i realize that's not within 100 miles but he can really give you a great perspective and i think a lot of the others that are supportive of this would you know be able to tag in on that okay so we i'd be glad to have justin come up here and so i want to make sure there's sarah hartsteit artstein and sarah where are you where are you from corvallis i don't think corvallis is 100 miles away is it representative no okay um let's see tim churchill medford certainly you come on up tim um dalton varstad yesterday and where are you from that's not a hundred miles sorry taylor jones that's not 100 okay all right so we'll put you in line with other people we have justin newman um travis mcdonald what where washington state doesn't count no you're able to be in line with other people sorry okay so there was somebody who lived 100 medford medford [Music] louisiana yes okay we will come on up their features okay all right so i'm going to ask you to make your testimony short we have about 25 minutes or less so if you can make your testimony short that would be great go ahead my name is justin newman i'm the vice president of sales and distribution for a eugene and springfield-based company called emerald vapors we sell vaporizer type products and solutions with and without nicotine i'm here today to support house bill 4073 on andy olson's side okay we're sorry representative olsen side to ban themselves liquids and vaporizers to to children to those under the age of 18. okay all right uh we believe the other bills go too far there's just not enough evidence to support their implementation and uh believe that more time is needed for that research so [Music] we've also taken a proactive i wanted to point this out we've taken a proactive approach to the underage vaping [Music] by posting exterior signs as well as interior signs implementing uh card verification in our stores and um and educating public so we do believe it should be an adult decision and not available for children [Music] and if you have written materials you're welcome to give it to staff and and we'll make sure it gets to everybody it looks like you have some written materials you know i do it's uh it has quite a few notes well i'm gonna i don't know if you can read my people here if you could just briefly summarize what your your salient points are that would be great okay basically we're here to to help implement a policy that that we've already proactively implemented ourselves and we think that representative olson's bill does a good job of that [Music] but the other bills go too far and i don't think i can say it any better than that so that's great thank you for doing that thank you go ahead madam chair and we need your name please okay madam chair and members of the committee um thank you for listening to us today um i would like to give you your name sorry my name is tim churchill i'm from medford and i'd like to applaud mr olsen or chair member olsen on the 40-73 to keep that away from miners i work for ec blend company who is a manufacturer of the e-liquids and we have over we employ over 120 people there in medford [Music] this is a very fast growing industry and it you guys have a lot of work ahead of you i'm sure on deciding the right path to take we support your focus on the welfare of the general public and for minors however we oppose the the major 4115 because it does restrict a lot of the retail stores from from offering the product the customer has to be able to try this product it's an item specific stores most of the vape shops it's not if you want to go and learn about vaping or try the products you really need to test them and this would have a negative economic effect on sales as at least 75 percent of those sales would come from the trials of the product um we would like to be defined as an exemption in this legislation if at all possible and we feel that there would be no excess exposure to the general public from vaping in the stores you you want to do you understand what he's saying about an exception i do not could you from this from the standalone stores in in the bill 4115 they were talking about um not restricting vaping in the stores okay unless it was a standalone store okay that that seems to be the current law regarding cigarettes so yeah tobacco great okay thank you very much madam chair committee thank you for the opportunity to testify for the record i am dr joel nitzken i am a public health physician from new orleans louisiana i've been active in tobacco control since the 1980s and since 2007 very active in the arena of tobacco harm reduction after that e-cigarettes most of the work i have done in this area i've done on behalf of the american association of public health physicians but lacking the financial resources to travel to try to address these issues i've had to seek additional outside support to make such testimony possible and for that purpose i've established a relationship with the r street institute and what is that the r street institute is a washington dc libertarian think tank that is dedicated to free market solutions to problems they are moderate in their views they fully respect the role of government in regulating industry to protect health and protect the environment but they're very concerned about cases and instances where the governmental agencies go well beyond the regulations needed to protect the the health of the public and in their mind the e-cigarette issue appears to be one of those issues and for that reason they're supporting the work that i do and others in the public health community that share these views very briefly uh i've prepared two handouts which should already have been distributed to the committee one with my testimony today and the second in our street paper making the case for tobacco harm reduction very briefly we fully support bill 4073 restricting sales to miners because nicotine per se can be harmful to the adolescent brain and should be restricted not only do we encourage support of that bill we would urge the legislature to up the age cut off from 18 to 21 because this tendency to propensity to addiction probably lasts until age 25 or 26 and we can get a much bigger portion of it and get this out of the high schools by upping the age to age 21. with regard to the prohibition of e-cigarettes and no smoking areas we think that that would be a damaging step to take from a public health perspective and let me under explain why first of all the studies have been completed e-cigarette vapor as expailed by the user [Music] does not contain any toxic chemical substances that are detectable above background levels in indoor environments no they are not it's not pure water vapor there aren't trace quantities of carcinogens there but the quantities are exceedingly low the reason for the sum up i'm going to ask you to sum up your testimony i know we have printed materials and we will look through that but we have a lot of people here who are wanting to testify let me tell you why i'm here and why i've dedicated my energy to this the government the federal agencies talk about 480 000 deaths a year due to tobacco products in the united states all of those deaths are due to a single product the combustible cigarette there are not enough deaths from all other tobacco products combined for the federal agencies to track since 2004 the numbers of smokers in the united states and the numbers of deaths by the best cdc estimates have been stable tobacco harm reduction which means simply informing smokers that they could reduce their risk a potentially fatal cancer heart and lung disease by 98 or better is the only feasible policy option we have for reducing the number of smokers in the united states and reducing those deaths 4115 is basically intended to communicate the idea that the e-cigarettes are as harmful as cigarettes because in the tobacco control world the mantra has always been a tobacco-free society dr nixon i'm going to give you 30 seconds okay if they would simply change that mantra to a smoke-free society they would be in line with the best of science i would welcome the opportunity to meet with those who are supportive of 4115 urge them to review the material and my handouts thank you dr thank you thank you very much we're suspending this just for a minute because we're doing a work session on hospital uh 434038 not on a chair members of the committee house bill 438 which was carried over from monday we have received a uh no fiscal impact statement so there's no uh revenue impact no fiscal impact on the dashboard amendment and the committee would be able to uh send it to move forward thank you great that's correct thank you madam chair okay okay yes i moved adopt the dash three amendments to house bill 4038 representative olson moves to doc adopt the dash three amendments dated 2 4 14 to the house bill 4038 in a discussion any objection if not the amendment is adopted representative manager removed house bill 4038 is amended to the floor with the new pass recommendation representative olson move as house bill

also ready for selling climb that measure was waiting for a revenue statement one has come in as indeterminate on the dash one and so it doesn't need to go towards the means right that's correct we have permission not to send it there i'm going to open up the work session and hospital 4028 representative okay ma'am sure i move to adopt the dash 1 amendments to house bill 4028 representative olson moves to adopt the dash 1 amendment stated 2 4 14 any discussion any objection so yeah i'm sure i move house bill 4028 as amended to the floor with the do pass recommendation and that as a subsequent referral to the committee on ways and means be defended to be rescinded representative olson moves house bill 4028 as amendment as amended to the floor um with the due pass recommendation and that the subsequent referral to the committee on ways and means be rescinded any discussion any objection uh oh no we've got to call that rule representative aye representative gelter aye [Music] excused vice chair gomberg hi this bill passes thank you so much committee can we rebuild it great good all right now we'll we open up the hearing on house bills 4073 and 4015. oh representative uh kenmore and i will carry that bill together thank you okay so now we're going back um actually i'm gonna call called everybody who lived more than 100 miles away right so i'm going to call up bill cross and um oh he's left but he will be back i think no um bill cross has a statement we'll we'll call him at a later time so um we're going to hear from karen gerard karen you guys are excused thank you so much yes oh i see okay so we have timothy schultz travis brisbane sean bowers and uh next we'll have those three people here please next we will have sam is that right yes ma'am okay um in the hot city [Music] very quickly so everybody will have a chance to speak i'd appreciate it and state your name please thank you madam chair my name is timothy schultz um i'm here as a couple of hats first off i'm i'm a user of tobacco electronic cigarettes i was a smoker for 25 years for the last five or ten of that pack and a half to two packs a day um over a year ago i quit smoking due to using vaping products i have noticed my health improved significantly as a result of that did so i know some of the science is up for question um but i know what it's done for me [Music] i don't hack i don't wheeze i smell better i taste better and all it totally enriched my life and i would i know i'd have family members that have died as a result of tobacco that would be alive today if these products were available back then um i'm also here as a hat as a shop manager i manage a shop in portland that sells these products i can tell you that i think the emergency measure is a little extreme every shop that i know of in this state already restricts the sales of these products to anyone who's an adult i know in my shop and every shop in portland we card on entry we absolutely will not sell to any miners we don't encourage that at all um i also feel that some of the the wording in 4115 um if it were to be enacted i i'm against it but i also feel some of the wording on restricting shops or sampling in shops except ones that are tobacco certified right now there aren't any shops that would even qualify under that certification mainly because of their standalone building um and to enact that and then save at the tobacco shops or allow the sample where somebody is going to then be forced to be in that tobacco environment when they're trying to save themselves from being around tobacco is totally unfair okay thank you very much for coming to testify i appreciate that [Music] my name is sean bowers thank you madam chair and committee i am a i'm a vaping product user i've used uh i've used e-cigarettes over the last couple of years but i found a great deal of uh difficulty in successfully switching to to the e-cigarette and away from the cigarette until i was able to until i realized that there were such things as stores that offered sampling and a in an environment that was welcoming to to the use of e-cigarettes and vaporizers um i was stuck using those little e-cigarettes that you found at 7-eleven which i just i never liked but then i found that there were flavors and there was a community of people in support of each other quitting smoking in support of the hobby that's found here and there were places in which we could go that we could test flavors in which we could build build community and and and and support each other in uh and try to get away from cigarettes i know in the last two months that i've been completely cigarette free uh i've already begun to taste them i've already been been able to breathe i can breathe a lot better i can taste i can smell um i can exert myself without gasping uh without go without fainting um i'm actually able to work for long periods of time to whereas before i could not do any exerted uh physical activity thank you so much for coming thank you hi my name is travis brisbane and uh i just want to say that i i'm proof that these work i was a smoker for 16 years i started when i was 12 and uh recently quit about uh been smoke free for about a year and i fully support uh vice chair olsens uh four zero seven three i do not believe that that miners should have access to these products however the 4115 uh restricting the use in the shops and at our vape meets where we get together and talk about these products and new things restricting that will be in my opinion detrimental to a lot of the success that comes with using electronic cigarettes you were talking earlier about giving gambling addiction and having programs for people to quit well these vape shops and our meetings with each other that's our program to stay off of tobacco oh that's cigarettes and if you take that away i just i don't know uh the health issues will will definitely take a blow thank you so much for coming to testify appreciate it thank you thank you manager so i called up several other people [Music] thank you i just had surgery sorry it seems that much to me to be here thank you that would trump 100 miles i i just had spinal cord surgery for the third time due to an injury not smoking related um my name is tommy deveraux earl i am also a registered nurse um and have been for more than a decade i worked in er and trauma and firsthand repeatedly have seen the effects of smoking i've held family members when they grieved through the loss of someone dying of copd who in the waiting room you know was wanting to smoke a cigarette or the patient that begs you to come down to smoke a cigarette and in that i was also smoking i thought i was a closet smoker now i know there's not such thing let me tell you i've vaped for five years longer than than than most here i searched and searched and searched for something and finally found something and it worked i remember you know having a code respiratory code and then i'd be on break and i'd go out to my car and try to suck down five cigarettes even though i just watched someone die [Music] i couldn't get through that finally i found this and and then through social media which i do i have over 400 twitter followers and 5 000 facebook followers and i did a lot to organize the group that's here today because we have a fellowship and that fellowship is through vaping if you limit how we are able to get together you i i will tell you i i have a vape meet in hillsborough we meet at coyotes once a month in the banquet room and last meeting i had 75 vapors that is 75 people not smoking and more come people come in people come out i can explain it to you i mean yeah the research is is that we do have research actually the burst in papers i don't know if anybody has mentioned those um let me pull it up sorry could you send that to us please i will send it that would be great because we have so many people here to testify um i will send that bit that would be weird let me just let me just say this is a grassroots movement this is not big tobacco this is not big farm we have a movement that started with the people and we designed a way to get off of cigarettes ourselves this is my personal nicotine device i made it cute i'm a girl and i like it way it's not appealing to a teenager i also make my own liquid and i have written an ebook on how to make it and i have for years helped people learn how to make their own we know what is in it there is the burst in papers igor burstin the drexel university school of public health did a study based on over 9 000 observations of e-liquid and vapor and found no apparent concern for bystanders exposed to e-cig vapor even under the worst conditions and i appreciate it if you would send that to it i i appreciate that this is my device okay there is a battery and a coil that i make and and wick which could be a cotton [Music] we we i disseminated through the group that that we would like to be respectful and not vape so i will not vape here for you but a one second demonstration i will just show you that it is just vapor i've seen that we did also that you've got to talk about with the state troopers out front while we were vaping and they were actually very interested and and nice to us and wanted to see what we were doing all it takes is an explanation thank you so much for coming especially your condition we really appreciate it thank you i would like um to be available if you ever have any further questions or work from a citizen in the committee please thank you thank you [Music] thank you madam chairman of committee my name is sam tom i work at fat boy vapors in gresham and i have a webcast internet show called a full frontal nerdy where we talk about vaping culture i'm also quite terrified to be here i've never been in a situation like this so please you're doing great 4073 i fully support this is not something i want to sell to kids i don't think that vaping should be geared towards children and i don't think it is currently people say because of the flavors that are produced that it's meant for children but i like cake as i recall there's a kind of smirnoff which is a vodka brand that is cake and liquor doesn't get talked about advertising to children as much as e-cigarettes have currently sampling the product is how i get people to stop smoking my mother is dying she's dying of cancer and pardon me she won't switch and i know for a fact i've talked to the doctors around her that she would feel better and breathe easier if she would but her addiction has been so ongoing that it will not be something she can get away from i couldn't get her started on this and if you restrict the ability of other people to get their family and their friends to stop smoking cigarettes which are proven to kill you and to start vaping which is proven to not kill you [Music] the health detriment is going to be incredible we're dealing major blows to tobacco just by doing this and i want to keep dealing those i want tobacco gone i want tobacco out of my system and i want to know everyone else's system as well thank you piping guy thank you so much and thank you thank you madam chairman say one more thing really fast nicotine is not only derived from tobacco it is derived we use it a pharmaceutical grade nicotine that is derived from many sources and if you could send that to it that would be real including tomatoes bell peppers that all of those contain nicotine as well thank you so much thank you adele adams i think obviously adele here and sarah okay you can be next [Music] okay and if you could just state your name and just start right on talking my committee is being great to stay here i appreciate it chair to my members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today and support a bill for 115. my name is adele adams and i'm here representing multnomah county working in the tobacco prevention education program with multnomah county health department i want to express the county's deep concern about the vapor products which are currently in use in our communities these products are being packaged and advertised and marketed particularly to youth yet these products are not regulated there's little research on the long-term effects of health for that reason multnomah county supports house bill 4115 to help protect the youth from accessing these products we appreciate legislators determination to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors and so we strongly support house house bill 4115 because it requires e-cigarettes to be included in the indoor clean air act and we believe that that's a critical piece without that inclusion we're creating an environment where vaping is considered an acceptable behavior and could become a normative youth uh culture for you here's what we do know and i won't repeat quite a bit of this because it's been talked about quite a bit today as far as the different studies that have been very quickly carcinogenic toxins that are in it so i won't go into that as much um but current smoking rates are down um in oregon from 57 among our 11th graders and 74 among our eighth graders since 1996. yet the use of e-cigarettes by teens and adults is on the rise and potentially creating addictions to nicotine among our youth deepening the addiction for current smokers and renewing the addiction for former smokers again talking about how these rates have doubled in the year of 2011 to 2012 in our young in our youth e-cigarettes are advertised in child-friendly flavors such as strawberry chocolate cotton candy and mint and in packaging that are smaller in size and appeal to young people we deeply are concerned about this product as being a genie in a bottle uh the bill will help protect our youth including e-cigarettes and the indoor cleaner act will help create an environment that discourages their youth thank you very much thank you for your time and if you have written material should people yes i want to be thank you for being here i want to be sure i understand are you talking on behalf of multnomah county through some action by the commissioners correct correct okay go ahead good afternoon noon chair to may vice chairs olson and gomberg and members of the committee my name is sarah hartstein and i am from the benton county health department i'm here to testify on behalf of the coalition of local health officials the association of oregon counties and the association of oregon community mental health programs in support of house bill 4115 with the dash five amendments electronic smoking devices or e-cigarettes are understudied and unregulated as you've heard smokeless at this point time does not necessarily mean that they are harmless the actual nicotine and chemical content of e-cigarettes does not always match the label as you've heard today the fda analyzed samples of e-cigarettes and found that they contained nicotine even though they were labeled as nicotine-free and that goes for different levels of nicotine as well some that were marked as high we're actually low in content some that were marked as low were actually higher the fda also found that samples of e-cigarettes contain chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects in the vapor i want to also add that e-cigarettes have also been used as a device for other drugs for example hash oil is now commercially available for use in cigarettes in washington and colorado it's no surprise that the use of e-cigarettes by youth is on the rise e-cigarettes are advertised in candy and fruit flavors that you've heard about today and they lack the legal age requirement that we're trying to address adele mentioned that youth rates have doubled and i will also mention that one in five youth that are e-cigarette users are not conventional tobacco users so that means that there's a possibility that they are creating a new addiction and if you remember ninety percent of smokers began their nicotine addiction before leaving their teens so the issue is really about nicotine initiation if you could sum it up give us written material would be fine yes house bill 4115 as amended would prohibit the sale of electronic smoking devices to miners and solution with any content not just nicotine content and prohibit use of electronic smoking devices indoors no matter what the content the coalition of local health officials the association of oregon counties and the association of oregon community mental health program urge you to support this important bill thank you very much thank you both come on and we is caleb hayes still here and um david glenn brennan venturi yeah if you wait just a minute after this group thank you go ahead hi um i'm travis mcdonald thank you madam chair and the representatives um i am a resident of hawaii um i'm representing hawaiian vapers the reason i'm here is i actually called some of these guys to come talking about wholesaling and they told me about this i got my car and i drove here um because it is like hawaii what's that from hawaii no from washington because i i live there yeah it's great it's back to the future and everything vapor approved but uh you know by hearing her story it is a tight community you know i smoked cigarettes from the time i was 11 to 3 and i'm 34. i quit six months ago because my sister came to me and said try this you quit smoking i laughed at her and i haven't smoked since now the question of if you're driving and does it look like a cigarette well does that look like a cigarette to you you know i mean hey i'm smoking a syrup no but at the same time i could say like the ones from the gas station yeah they might look like a cigarette and then it would be harder for a cop or what have you you know the whole point of me being here is you know to sell the miners no i mean that doesn't make any sense but the reason that they say oh strawberry this flavor that flavor because kids grow to be adults everybody loves those flavors you know i mean how can you say oh well kids are going to like it well you were a kid once of course you still like strawberry why does that dictate the difference between you know if you can vape it smoking cigarettes has four thousand carcinogens tar i'm not going to go in any those numbers you have all that information i'm just giving you a testimony of that this saved my life both my dad's my stepdad and my dad died from cancer you know they would be alive today and this was just three and a half years ago but i didn't know about it and guess what i did after they died i smoked a cigarette so i put myself in that same situation and now every single day when i give someone this whether they're 21 or 18 you know because they've got to be 18 right so 18 or they're 70 years old i feel that i'm helping those people every single time and when their kids bring their their mothers and their fathers in you know i'm helping those people every single time i've sold advertising all these things that maybe helps businesses do that but now i help people every single day and if you take that away from these people what do you think they're going to do go back to smoke with cigarettes you know and it's it's not bitter fun so thank you for letting me keep coming thank you for coming caleb tome members of the committee my name is caleb hayes i'm here on behalf of nasw the national association of social workers and our 1800 members right here in oregon here to testify in support of both bills at hand with the preference for 4115 i think it's been made clear by almost everyone in the room that we should ban the sale of these items to miners obviously we agree with that additionally we'd like to see these concepts go a little bit further and you know at the risk of going a little bit into the weeds you know we would love to see attacks on these and uh with that being said uh you know we support uh center um excuse me representative barnhart's concept mainly because you know i think it's clear to everyone now that we took too long to ban smoking cigarettes inside that i think there's a lot of science behind that why take that risk again uh with these products why don't we make sure that it's actually safe before we go ahead and let that happen thank you go ahead sir [Music] i'm not with this guy i gathered that um my name is david glenn i uh i am i'm the owner of fat boy vapers in gresham oregon um i was a smoker for 20 years um i would my whole naval career was uh one cigarette break after another i think and that kind of summed up my whole career sometimes um i was nearly two packs a day for the last 10 years that i smoked my brother bought me this little cigarette looking thing um it didn't work for me no he said it was vapor at the time it didn't work so he took me to a vapor shop up in lakewood washington uh called the vaporium where i got to sample and try flavors there were people there could show me what how it worked i didn't buy a pack of cigarettes after that i never bought one 20 years of smoking i've tried every device to try to quit smoking i've tried to patch i've tried chantix it put me in the hospital while i was on active duty it messed me up this worked as for how well my lungs are now they're still healing a lot of damage was done from smoking um but but i i can breathe better um than i used to i really believe in what it's doing when i got out of the navy i started going to college i couldn't smoke on the campus so there was a whole parade of people that would go off campus to get their cigarette so i joined them uh and started talking about vapor with them because it worked for me and i converted a lot of those guys to vapors and they don't smoke now and i was going to school for business so i started a business and i truly believe i'm saving lives it saved my life it saved some of my family members lives and the restriction that 114115 can put on retail stores being able to provide that service and helping people understand what it can do for them it does require the sampling to get that sensation of what this really could work um the underage thing we card people yeah uh representative olson his his bill prevents that i think that's great before one one five it goes way too far and it it there's so much more research that's needed and that's really all i got to say thank you great thank you thank you all to come to for coming to testify so who have i forgotten here sean is it bowers have i called you yet oh i called you sir come on up uh robert ward is he here um brennan venturi is that you yes okay you probably signed on both i did dalton larstad [Music] okay great i'm gonna allow someone else to do that okay go ahead is there anybody who signed oh i've got michael allen jones taylor jones pardon taylor jones taylor jones yeah go come on um michael allen jones so i have a michael allen jones is there anybody who's signed up that i haven't called you it's confusing okay um all right two more one two three okay all right all right go ahead hi um my name is brennan venturi i'm the owner of an electronic cigarette lounge in portland oregon also one down in springfield oregon and i'm here today to be in favor of 4073 i think that we already have uh signs posted on our door say 18 plus only we don't allow anyone under the age of 18 in on the premises um we don't believe what would be helpful is if you've already heard this testimony i agree with that we don't need to hear it again because it sounds like that there will be a lot of people who own the shops and you're you're carting people uh under 18 right so that would be great but if you've got something else new that you'd like us to know appreciate that yeah i do um i'd like to speak on the part of the clean air act um and that would be 41-15 right correct 41-15 um i am citing a study on behalf of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco published by oxford university um i'm just going to give you the conclusions i won't that would be great and you can send that to us and we'll put it on our files and look at it that would be great uh the conclusion is using an electronic cigarette an indoor environments has 10 percent less harm less nicotine content in it than conventional cigarettes also if you've ever been around it obviously there's a massive difference in in the odor and just the effect that's pretty much all i have on on four one one five okay thank you so much appreciate it thank you my name is dalton parsad a vape game co-owner and springfield store operator much like other stores you know we already carried everyone that looks under the age of 25 only sell to 18 years or older but on the top the topic of hp 115 i have to disagree because it feels preemptive it's not following all the evidence that's been gathered and will put undue restrictions on our trade customers shipping modes and industry as a whole i have a problem saying that electronic cigarettes or personalized personal vaporizers should be deemed the same as cigarettes especially since there have been several things positive from these and only the unconfirmed negatives have been focused on in the short term there are more relevant studies about the published about to be published that would help us and we need a chance to create a better organized and appropriate regulation not to mention the damage it would do to risking pay cuts and job losses for um i have 12 employees at my shop portland and eugene included you know uh the other stores you know other stores staff around around me or the outlying industries that support us and as well as the billion dollar subsection of our economy that this has become so thank you thank you for coming to us i appreciate that go ahead my name is taylor jones uh i'm i have two points to make and i'll make them as brief as i can uh i'm a molecular biologist trained at the university of oregon i have years a couple years of labs experience in research setting so i've i'm vetted in reading scientific literature i've read a lot of the studies the studies that listed the even the fda study the lists we've space where they say that we've tested cigalikes we've tested the cigarettes the e-cigarettes that look like cigarettes that's what they tested and they tested an older style of um e-liquid manufactured and old under old premises had diethylene glycol and it had impure nicotine that had the nitrosamines the whole tobacco alkaloid still in it that's no longer acceptable industry practices american eloquent manufacturing standards association uh has set up a framework for what is acceptable and what's not acceptable an e-liquid manufacturer none of the diacetyl diacetyl the diethylene glycol the and the and the purity of nicotine has to be so pure that it doesn't have the nitrosamines in it so that these things have been set up so that the secondhand vapor and the vapor is not as dangerous as even if the light amount of dangerousness that was found in some some of these older studies now the second point i want to make is that 4115 house bill 4115 restricts shops in such a way that it would force the consumer that wants to stay off of cigarettes and wants to continue using uh cigarettes to purchase the e-liquid first of all from other other states at the best case scenario where our organ money would go to out of state and second of all more and more likely is that they would be producing inferior products that would be made in china with inferior levels of inferior quality propylene glycol inferior quality vegetable glycerin inferior quality nicotine which would be a dire detriment to the vaping society as a whole and the health of oregonians as a whole so i you know i'm a father i don't want my kids to get a hold of this stuff until they're in until it's a face-to-face adult decision that they can make you know i don't want that i'm totally in support of olson's representative olson's bill but the house bill 4115 has has gone way too far and and and the impacts haven't been outlined by the writer and if you have scientific information that you're deciding i'll send you i will send you a list of links thank you just a quick question man i'm sure thank you is this product regulated at all by fda's or anyone that knows what's going in actually not yet but there are a bunch of manufacturers including me i'm the lab manager at vape game mm-hmm i'm the lab manager at vape game i have a vape game it's the same company it's in springfield oregon's the same company that these gentlemen own we go by ames the standard so there are lots of manufacturers that and and when you follow amesa standards you have to list which fluids that you might may or may not carry that do and do not follow ames standards the aims of certification process is a lengthy process we're in the midst of it but we meet these requirements and is anyone checking to make sure that yes aims to be a member of ames uh they can do like spot checking they do random spot checking and how do you spell that a e m s a dot org it's american e-liquid manufacturers standards association and you will send that to us yes i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry okay thank you all very much thank you and so there were some people who signed up and who haven't had a chance to speak yet come on up sir and tell me your name my name is paul bates paul bates and you did sign up i've got oh there you are and sean mcdonald come on up [Music] and robert wood ward robert ward what is your name sir back there steve jones he called me about come on up michael johns [Music] john's or jones jones jones got it michael okay go ahead my name is paul bates that actually sounds right um here today to both support four zero seven three and oppose four one one five there's been a lot of evidence given here in various levels of um elegance and eloquence um i'd like to say that i am current owner of division vapor in portland oregon i had been a smoker for 25 years seriously trying to quit for the last 10 and e-cigarettes are the only method i have found in all those years of trying to quitting that actually work gonna go beyond that a little bit right now you've heard the evidence we are hearing from tons of people thinking that vaping saved their life maybe saved your life right saved your life okay could you also put up your hands people who own businesses the businesses that sell these great thank you very much okay [Music] i'd like to say that [Music] 4115 misses the point in attempting to lump electronic cigarettes in with smoking completely misses the point of what it does it is a different process so completely different that you need proper background studies and everything else to build your own law rather than tacking it on to something that was a smoking law smoking is burning plant material you light it on fire it produces smoke which is absolutely a different process than vaporization you know smoke will set off your smoke alarm in your kitchen you start burning something on a pan smoke you boil water you do not set off your smoke alarms it is a different completely different substance paul i'm going to ask you to wrap it up everybody stay here very i'd just like to make that that point should be entirely clear to almost anybody who studies this subject and they're trying to listen to one pager and give it to staff then we'll make sure everybody gets it all right thank you paul thank you go ahead good afternoon my name is sean mcdonald and i began smoking college and only after a year of smoking it had terrible effects on my body and i knew i needed to quit so i set a goal to quit before i graduated from college and i was successful it took a long time and i kept kind of procrastinating on quitting i tried cold turkey from the patch and i figured you know what i had a buddy who had an electronic cigarette and i tried it and that was what worked now 11 months smoke free and recently i had my fiancee try it and she wasn't too pleased it wasn't until she was able to go into a store and find the light right liquid for her at the right nicotine strength that really did i took a smoker before this yeah i yeah i smoked for about a year she's my fiance about 10 years now okay at about 30 cigarettes a day which is now dropped to one or two i'm hoping soon that number is going to be zero we wish her good luck thank you thank you hi guys michael jones rock and vape i'm in albany and uh i just want to share a little story with you guys this reminds me a lot of of why we started this business um i have first-time customers that crumble their packs of cigarettes into the trash you know i have seen first-time customers tell me their very own testimony just like we have here some tell me this was their last chance you know some tell me they have tried chantix and still have nightmares from the fda you know i i still have you know customers that have actually just cried right on the spot after you get it and i understand if you if you're not a smoker and you've never been addicted to this you're not going to get it and i get that you know i get that but if you have and you've tried everything because i guarantee you most of the businesses that have gone into this this is passion this is straight passion and that's nothing more nothing less of it but we love what this product did for us and how we get to go and quit tobacco we are not tobacco there is no we are not tobacco am i right guys and i think if we want to take something away from this we're not big tobacco we don't support it and the little guys the little e-cigs that you see in the shops you know were the residuals from that not them they didn't create this we did and i think when we when we look back you know we want to we want it to be known that it wasn't them that got us here it was us this is about us saving us you know and all we want is a better life for ourselves so you know i thank you guys for staying late with us and uh i'm definitely in support of 4073. so much okay um jeff i there's some people i still haven't called just did i call justin newman okay so he's off edward is that you sir okay come on up sure oh and jane clark is that you okay so if i call uh sean bowers did i call him already and robert wood okay thank you again committee for saying oh and and oh tommy you were tommy right yeah terrific okay okay me all right because people signed up for both bills and so i'm just trying to here so go ahead hey my name is uh for the record my name is edward wiggins uh thank you madam chair and uh everybody else um i'm a new owner of newberg vapers in newberg oregon here uh i came across jacob over here he turned me on to electronic cigarettes and i quit smoking cigar i i quit smoking cigarettes i went to cigars and then now i'm done i pulled money out of my retirement that's how passionate i am on this my wife's quit smoking everything my main point is is i went from 20 milligrams of nicotine i'm now down to eight in in one month's time and my goal as a business owner is to pass that on to everybody else so they don't have to have either one it's about getting everybody off the tobacco onto the pen and then throw it away that's what i want i want to lose customers that it can go through a good question so i'm just going to ask briefly has anybody done that who went from cigarettes to vaping and then all yeah yes four customers that have done it okay good actually more than four customers have multiple customers that can come and testify that they quit totally good enough okay go ahead that was my whole point thank you i think most of these people back here that's where the different nicotine levels come in and it get people often done and so i support 40 78 but we need to be able to have our shops where we can gather okay thank you go ahead my name is jacob and i'm the owner of elite smoke station what's the owner of what what the earlier small station a smoke station elite thank you okay thank you i have been selling electronic cigarettes for over six months now in salem oregon and i got to meet a lot of people that were smokers with smoking switched to vaporizers and some of them are not even vaporizing anymore so i think that's a great point that they started with something switched to something else and then now they're doing nothing if you limit their ability to vaporize outside which there isn't enough research about the product that it says anything bad about it for people who are around vaporizers [Music] i think you're just gonna steal the opportunity from them to become those people that quit everything okay so thank you for coming to testify i appreciate that i support the bill by the way that super simple [Music] i'm going to make this really quick my name is jane clark and i've never done this in my life and i'm shaking in my boots you're doing great yeah so i called and talked to my staff yeah okay so i'm i'm 53 years old i smoked for almost 33 years i have five grand kids and and and three children my own i do not smoke cigarettes anymore thanks

amity okay i know yes i work uh am i allowed to say where i work if i shouldn't die i work for nordstrom good i've been there five and a half years and the last thing i'd like to say is thank you for allowing me to try these in public i'm down to 16 or 14 milligrams and i mean i never dreamt that i'd ever quit smoking i smoked a lot for a long time and the fda does not require on the things that i sell skincare wise uh to be tested either just saying i and i didn't know that this was going to be here today i heard about it and i asked if i could leave work early and they let me good that's all i'd like to say thank you thank you jane thank you for coming anybody who's not had a chance to testify who would like to come on up very quickly anybody else this is our last person [Music] so what is your name sir give me the opportunity my name is daddy smarty i'm actually the former fed again thaddeus marnie i love that name thank you oh my gosh you tell us late in the day um right i'm actually the former board member of an organization called the consumer advocates for smoke-free alternatives association that we absolutely uh promote the um uh education on tobacco harm reduction uh very familiar with joel niskanen glad to see him here today and i strongly encourage you to pay very close attention to what he had to share today um i wanted to um everybody here did such a great job i don't want to recap too much but i wanted to bring up a couple of things that haven't been brought up um specifically with 4115 because of excuse me i'm fighting up a little bit of cold myself but and i'm new to the whole process of politics and getting nervous but um because 4115 does not specify nicotine products in its inclusion of smoking products it would actually also include the use of e-cigarettes for cannabis under the oregon medical marijuana act as well as the likelihood of upcoming legalization and it's important to note that we have a lot millions of uh deathly ill medical marijuana patients in this state that need to have an access to their medicine without having to smoke it and if 4115 was passed they would not only they would actually have to basically return to smoking in many cases or not be able to use these smoke-free alternatives in places where they're not able to or to smoke because of the wide variety of places where smoking is prohibited by the oregon clean air act so i think it's very important to keep and keep that very much in mind that this not only affects those of us who are trying to get away from the harms of tobacco smoking but also uh cannabis patients who are trying to get away from the harms of smoking anything the the real bottom line and i really want to echo what uh previous statement said is the difference between fire flaming burning and smoking that's when you light something on fire that's what creates the ash that's what creates the carbon monoxide that's what creates the tar that's what creates the smoke and that's also what creates the fire hazards that's another issue you don't you're brought up very often you're not going to light e-cigarettes prevent forest fires i love it okay thaddeus thank you thank you very much one question thank you no i just wondered does that mean that currently um medical marijuana users can either smoke or vape marijuana in restaurants put all of the buildings that prohibit it it's possible you can use a vaporizer anywhere um it's not included in the oregon smoking cleaner act um but using vaporized products uh allows them to uh use them without an effect on um bystanders uh recent studies and i can refer them to the committee showing that uh vaporizing drastically reduces uh any uh toxins definitely to the user but but to bystanders to millions of levels times below what could possibly have any effect on bystanders yeah i'm just wondering about secondhand smoke oh and vaping marijuana and second-hand smoke is like okay he just raised another drastically it drastically reduces it drastically reduces that because it's vaporized when you burn some when you light something on fire you're actually producing particulate matter that's actually floating in the air and so it's spreading around when you're vaporizing it it's just a tiny tiny amount a heavy user uses less than a teaspoon a day of liquid thank you um thank you and there's just not much to be spread you're welcome to send something in writing thank you great thank you so much um representative gumberg thank you madam sharon and and thank you for extending this this hearing for nearly an hour i mean i've been in this room since one o'clock this afternoon but i learned a lot in the last two hours and i appreciate that very much i also wanted to say i'm really gratified to hear stories from people who testified today that that this new device has helped them get away from tobacco that that's very positive news as well i i have a question that i want to share with the group and i encourage them to answer my question in writing and i'll put that that material into our public record as well and and the question is this um we've heard from a lot of people that are recovering smokers tobacco smokers and they were certainly familiar with the current restrictions on tobacco smoking and they're essentially arguing that those restrictions should not apply to e-cigarettes as they do to tobacco cigarettes and some people address that rather directly but most people just simply said the bill goes too far i'd like to understand better the difference between tobacco smoking in public and e-cigarette smoking in public and part of the context for that is we had a very brief demonstration of vaping here very brief and i'll just say for the record that from here 10 feet away that we could discern the vanilla flavor the flavoring and it was very very brief but i think from 10 feet away my colleagues would agree we could smell it from here and i'd just like to understand better the context of public cigarette smoking and public e-cigarette smoking so write to me send me an email i will put it into the committee record thank you representative and i know i'm sorry man uh representative barnard is he still here get new glasses okay thank you madam chair again phil barnhart state representative house district 11. i've sat through this hearing i have learned some things today that i did not know i want the committee to understand that i prepared four different amendments having to do with demonstrations of products the one that i presented to you earlier the dash one amendment simply doesn't allow the demonstration of products i have heard today from people who are vehement about getting off of tobacco and they see this as a mean they see vaping as a means of accomplishing that and they point out and i think fairly persuasively that in order to get people who are chronic tobacco users to try something that may may help they claim it does i have no evidence one way or the other that they would like to be able to demonstrate the use of these products to the people who come into their vape shops i have prepared a dash three amendment which i think i shared with the chair i'm not certain it's on the it's on the list it's on the list i prepared a dash three amendment the dash three amendment does all the things the dash one amendment does except in line 18 and 19 pedestrian amendment says vaping is permitted in a shop that exclusively sells vapor products now when i first prepared this i thought this was very impractical because i thought obviously erroneously that people uh who were interested in demonstrations would want to demonstrate tobacco and and cigars and cigarettes and a buy a variety of other things and vapor products in the same place what we've heard today from the uh from the uh people who said that my bill goes too far is that they're not interested in tobacco products they want to get off of tobacco products and they see being able to demonstrate the use of their vape vapor products in their shops as a positive thing to help other people do that given that we given the situation that we're in i am perfectly willing for the committee to experiment with this issue to take them at their word to adopt the dash three amendment instead of the dash one that i earlier proposed because i'm convinced that at least the people who came to testify here who own vape shops are sincere in wanting to help people get off of of tobacco now i think it's really important for the committee to recognize that nobody in the testimony you've heard has suggested that it's okay for kids to use these products nobody has suggested that that was okay that suggests to me that despite all the other protestations that people have that there's a danger perceived at least in the use of vapor products otherwise why would we care if kids use them that leads me to the firm belief that we need to restrict the use of vapor products in public in the same way that we restrict the use of cigarettes in public the issue that has been raised over and over again today isn't really about that issue it's about the issue of converting people who are already addicted to tobacco products to something that is less harmful to them i'm willing to go there and that's why i propose that the committee consider the dash three amendment uh and let's take them at their word and let's see if they can actually make that work in in a way but i don't want to i don't want to expose the general public to additional nicotine products other products of that sort in the air that we breathe in the normal no smoking areas that's why i proposed a bill in the first place and i urge the committee to uh to uh to pass the uh the basic bill that i've already proposed but this one wrinkle might be useful for those people who are zealous about helping other people get off of the use of of tobacco cigarettes one other comment if i may it is already unlawful to use uh marijuana in any form uh uh in in a way that would put something into the air in a public place marijuana is more restricted than the use of tobacco so the the last witness before me who was talking about that i think is incorrect i'm sorry that mark mayer left because he would be the person who could give you a definitive statement about what the rule about marijuana is but is my understanding that it is not legal now to to use marijuana in a way that puts it out into the air and my my able staff just handed me a statue that that includes the dangerous weapons on the bottom and limitations on immunity at the top for marijuana and and i'm it is i'll just give you the statute number because i can't read it in a minute it's rs-475.316 i suggest looking at that and also checking with with mark mayer about that issue but it is my understanding at least that it would be unlawful for a person to put hashish or some other thc type product in a in a vape product even if they're even if they are using it for medical reasons and use it in a public place now that this bill doesn't have any effect at all on that issue thank you representative any quick questions welcome to the human services and housing committee she's brand new to the legislature this is her third day so we're so happy to have her did i ask you yes so the um actually my mind was kind of going in the same direction as yours and i appreciate you um lighting up your your e-cigarette because i actually haven't seen it and i've heard from a lot of people that they've been next to someone in an airport who's done it and that it actually really bothered them and i didn't know what it was about but i got a very strong whiff too and so that does raise concerns for me about being in a restaurant or next to someone in a train station or those kind of places and so i like the direction that it's going and i wonder if out of the people all the people who own the vaping stores here are there if the earth says the vaping is permitted in a shop that exclusively sells vapor products does that include everyone here all of your shops exclusively sell vaping products yeah yes or is there any other sodas [Music] so i just wonder i'm sorry you cannot speak from the audience okay so i just wanted to be clear because some of you maybe haven't seen the amendment if you have any suggestions about that language we are in a very tight timetable i encourage you to um to contact representative barnhart absolutely any last comments representative olson you've been very patient anything okay anything else i you know i don't i'm sorry no um i asked the committee not you um so i don't usually allow applause even though we did have some plots earlier on but usually we don't but i want you to applaud yourselves you were very patient you stayed here a very long time to listen to a lot of testimony about bills about which you had no interest and you were very patient to stay and you were very polite here and we really appreciate it so i'm going to give you a nice yay with that we're going to close the public hearing and the work session on house bills 41 15 and 40 75 and we will carry both of these bills over again thank you very much thank you committee you
TlbHVqXTsGo,4-10-2017,3780,OR,three different statutes that actually impose taxes on cigarettes so it's a good thing to keep in mind in some cases when you see uh legislation that is increasing the tax it may only touch one of these statutes and that's important because these statutes do have different allocations for those dollars that come in so it's specific to one of these three statutes then controls the distribution so the chart i have down here it's a little small there uh it shows these are the overall collections and how they get distributed both on the cents per pack or by percentage terms so you can see the oregon health plan is getting about 65 percent of if you're looking on that dollar dollar 32 per pack of cigarettes that's the tax that's imposed on the oregon level uh the oregon health plan is getting about 65 percent of that dollar 32 or 86 cents per pack and working working backwards it would be the general funds getting 22 cents per pack about 17 percent and then mental health 14 cents and then you have uh tobacco use and reduction getting three cents and the cities counties and department of transportation's elderly transportation fund each get two cents per pack and again i set it up where you can follow through a little bit from each of the statutes where that distribution is and you can see one of the the more recent uh increase i think this is trying to remember the years a few years back when there was an additional 13 cents per pack placed on cigarettes that was an ors 323 0 30 sub 4 and that puts it 100 percent of that distribution is going to oregon health authority in their mental health program and so again that's just something to keep in mind when you're seeing the different bills that may make changes or adjusting the tax rate on cigarettes is sometimes it can it can look more complicated in some cases just because it may be holding the existing distribution constant and then adding a new one on there or it may just send it through with the exact same distribution so there may be an additional program that's getting funded but it can look a little odd because you can see there's that split of 30th 29.37 30th and so forth and then the last document i have up on olas um is coming from the distribution i actually don't see it up there okay there it is um is just the distribution of the receipts and this comes from the or the office economic analysis in their quarterly forecast there's a page in there that has the distribution to each of the funds and this has for both the otp and the cigarette tax distribution so if you want to see the actual dollars that are coming in on an annual or biennial basis you can reference that document as well okay and that's what i have prepared as a little background i'm happy to take any questions yes johnson please sure kyle um the oha money i see that i think the one um distribution in the middle here that's related to mental health i think was the byproduct of the 2013 grand bargain correct yes that goes to mental health do we know whether the other portion that they get via the other parts of the cigarette tax have a specific purpose within oha just general fund oha type usage do we know whether there's any health related benefits perhaps at least in theory or is there anything we quantify yes chair barn representative johnson it usually directs it to it's fairly broad so it is something specific to the oregon health plan so it could be funding any i guess any relation to the oregon health plan there's not maybe a specific program to yeah smoking suppression or something like that all right thoughts you know just it'd be nice to know i guess since it's the largest beneficiary of the cigarette tax and know what what consumers are getting for that investment that makes sense can we find out can definitely yeah get information to follow the dollars through the program yeah that would be good any other questions has has anybody recently tried to simplify this distribution symptom a system maybe even without sorry slip of the time maybe even without um uh changing the actual distribution because it looks pretty complicated yeah mr chair i think part of the pro is even in the rounding it can change the dollar allocations is more low so you do sometimes when the bill changes yeah but even when you just round it to a tenth or something without effect someone someone's gaining some and some someone is losing a little all right well we have a number of bills colleagues that that will affect the amounts of these taxes and maybe even the distribution so i thought you probably better have a look at this first and you can see there are a lot of different interests represented in in the in this in this distribution anything else uh yes uh representative smith chair and i apologize if this was brought up already but the um the did we talk about the elderly transportation and how that got in there originally i have not i can research that i don't know okay i just wondered if you like or perhaps one of my colleagues might be i do remember that but i'm gonna i want to make sure it's 100 accurate so i'm going to refrain but i do remember that i keep thinking of how valuable it is to have a ways and means member on this committee as well thank you appreciate the presentation today given our our schedule this afternoon and the and the timing for the when people can attend we're going to close the information meeting and open a work session on house bill 2676 we have a little bit of an unusual process today representative vance and then i'll discuss what we're doing mr chairman movie reconsider the vote by which house bill 2676 was sent to the floor with the due pass as amended recommendation thank you representative vance moves to reconsider the vote by which house bill 2676 was sent to the floor with a due pass as amended recommendation let me just start by by saying this is an unusual procedure but once in a while we get new information that suggests that we need to have additional discussion maybe even additional hearing perhaps about a bill so i thought in the best the most prudent thing we could do since we're not anywhere near the end of session was to pull this thing back so we can consider it further and i think i've talked with most of the members about it so that we could proceed other discussion joining objection to the motion hearing none it is so ordered um now do i need to do something else i think we need now to do the reconsideration don't we or did we do the whole thing all in one just the whole thing oh do i need to do any any additional just brought it back to them we brought it back to the committee but uh but now we need to move to rescind the vote by which we send it to the floor isn't that correct okay uh representative knows would you make that motion are you prepared to um i'm prepared to do it but i could use a little help on how to actually word it i think what you say is yeah i moved here to send them the vote uh motion by which the vote by which we sent the bill to the floor with the do-pass recommendation i'm going to say we johnson thank you for all your help um mr chair i would like to rescind the motion that i made sending house bill 2676 to the floor with a do pass recommendation thank you representative nos moves that the committee rescind the uh vote reconsider the vote and rescind it by which we sent house bill 2676 to the floor with a due pass recommendation i think that gets us to the place where we had it in the work session before uh and able to able to keep it in the committee so that we can do further consideration any further discussion can i just give it please represent now so mr chair members of the committee um we're going to have a meeting myself uh i believe let's say council let's let's the revenue staff are going to be there uh the advocate for the bill folks in the department of revenue and try to figure out what the concern is i don't remember the members of the committee house bill 3296 would add a tax on certain types of nicotine products that don't contain tobacco they would be nicotine products that could be ingested however there's no actual tobacco in it they are awaiting an amendment for this measure it's not in yet but it would uh make it so that this uh this measure did not apply to certain food products it turns out that there are some vegetables in the nightshade family that naturally contains some nicotine and without an amendment this measure would add a tax on those um so that's that's um being awaited i wonder why i liked eggplant so much well nightshade of course includes potatoes eggplants tomatoes and probably two or three other things that we many of us like to eat please go ahead is that it okay all right ah let's see we've got a lot of people signed up here today why don't we hear from the state departments first katrina head head is it hedberg indiana mack then also perhaps in the league wendy johnson so it looks to me like the three of you have some information to add that might be helpful so why don't we start with you mine will be very brief thank you um chair barnhart membership committee my name is wendy johnson here on behalf of the league of oregon city uh of oregon cities it's sort of a transition from the the presentation that that kyle just gave on tobacco and how that tax is distributed cities do receive a portion of the tax revenue from cigarettes it's very small it's that two cents we do not receive any tax revenue from the other tobacco so i and you've had plenty of vaping bills already in this committee and now this ingestible piece so my testimony is simply that we would like to see a revenue share from these other tobacco products the cities are responsible for policing this issue now that for example vaping it can't be done by miners the cleaning the oregon clean indoor act that passed recently added vaping to the list so we have that cost as well and so as you think about just the distribution method of any new taxes we would ask that you consider the cities and counties in that distribution it's as you noted it's a very complicated um formula for the cigarette tax we would not suggest anything that complicated but especially if there's a preemption what's particularly offensive to the cities is that when this the cigarette tax was initially imposed there was a preemption but cities received 25 percent of the cigarette tax and now you know it's two percent in addition 50 percent went to property tax um assistance so essentially 75 of the cigarette tax originally helped out the local governments and now we get two percent um and so some of you have received the league's brochure on what our state shared revenues look like it's now less than a dollar 20 a person of what we're getting in cigarette revenues um it doesn't pay for the the costs and we're preempted from imposing that tax locally so that's all my testimony is just to consider how you should distribute any new taxes on these new products that have now really replaced cigarettes which we think is is helpful perhaps better than some of the other products out there but um the tax situation has not changed so thank you very good thank you okay mr chair members of the committee for the record deanna mac department of revenue and the bill um as drafted we just have some technical changes that we would like to request right now it deals with tobacco substitutes that do not include vape products containing tobacco or products prescribed by health professional for smoking cessation yet many of them are fda approved and they're over the counter like nicorette gum so we'd want to make sure that it was clear that those are also included in this definition so the tax would not be imposed on that as well as some other minor technical changes relating to the terms tobacco and tobacco substitute and we're happy to work with lro to make sure that those if the bill continues to move that it has uh the correct language in it for us to administer okay thank you and do you have an amendment or i have i do have language when you provide okay yeah thank you because we're obviously going to need your help to get that part done happy to do it thanks chair barnard members of the committee i'm dr katrina hedberg i'm the state health officer with the public health division of the oregon health authority and i'm here to testify or provide information about the importance of making sure that tobacco substitute products are treated the same as other nicotine containing tobacco products so again i appreciate what you said about small amounts of nicotine in fruits and vegetables we want people to eat fruits or vegetables we're talking about products that specifically people are using because of the nicotine concentration in those products so part of the issues around nicotine nicotine in and of itself and high levels can cause some toxicity it can cause rapid heart rate kids for example who have a nicotine toxicity it's a stimulant so anxiety hypertension nausea vomiting in fact there have been cases of actually nicotine poisoning deaths when children contain so nicotine in and of itself in high concentrations is dangerous we're of course concerned about the other component of nicotine which is that it is highly addictive and we know from use for e-cigarettes for example that are nicotine containing that there are many people who use this who use tobacco products crossover they use sort of both e-cigarettes as well as other tobacco products tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of both morbidity and mortality so illness and death in the state of oregon we've also seen when new products come online for example e-cigarettes we saw a sudden bump up in the increase of e-cigarettes among youth so these types of products particularly appeal to young to youth and young adults and then many of them become addicted to nicotine and then have a lifetime habit related to tobacco addiction we also know that taxing tobacco products and including tobacco substitute is an evidence-based practice for decreasing use overall and this is something that at the centers for disease control when we're looking at how we limit the negative consequences of tobacco use increasing the price of products is one is one way that we do that um so i'd be happy to answer any um additional questions thank you thank you very much questions for this panel represent johnson i think mr chairman the question could be for you or for our doctor here but help me understand what we're talking about here again what exactly are we referring to it's not tobacco it's not vaping it's not it's not for that sort of thing what is this tobacco substitute page three alliance statute lines four through nine or ten is the definition of tobacco substitute but again that doesn't give me a product name oh yeah okay so chair barnard and representative johnson i myself so i had some questions so what we find obviously cigarettes cigars pipes we're all aware of what tobacco is then of course there's also the snuff and the tobacco which is is fine then there are things like orbs which include nicotine but they're more like a little candy they look like tic tac but again the nicotine in those is derived from tobacco but i think what we're talking about here is nicotine that's not derived from tobacco so it doesn't fall under that taxation but is a synthetic a tibetan or derived perhaps from some of the other vegetables that you mentioned members of the deadly nightshade family in oregon or in the united states now we understand that there's something called zinn nt which is sold by a swedish tobacco company which is similar to some of these other products and oregon is a test market for this so i think it's not in wide distribution but we are aware of these products and they have the potential of coming online again when you look at other products that are regulated other tobacco derived nicotine products and this is a way to say oh they don't fall under that but for all intents and purposes they are the same as some of these other ingestible if you will forms of tobacco please so if i wanted to purchase some of these products where would i go who sells this stuff so dear barnard represented johnson i personally don't know right before i came up here i texted it again oregon's a test market i think you're you can actually get some of them online which is in and of itself a problem but um there are potentially sites of distribution once they see whether this test market whether it flies in oregon what we found when e-cigarettes started so this was an example after they got on the mark and were here for a while we started to see them popping up in malls for example and being sold we do not see that yet so i think in some ways this is a little bit preemptive that it hasn't happened wide scale yet um but that we have concerns that it may be going in that direction right thank you i think you answered this question but i'm not sure is nicotine something that can be artificially manufactured or does it have to be derived from from some kind of a plant process or do we know so chair barnard i don't know but i can get you that information because of course you know it's i mean nicotine is a is a chemical and so many substances both are naturally derived from plants that's where they start and then there is a synthetic you know they're manufactured in you know chemical laboratories etc i don't know the answer for nicotine but i can find that out for you thank you and what i understand this bill does is that it simply says that they have to they have to pay the tax that you would pay if it were nicotine if it were a tobacco product even though it it contains nicotine but it is not a tobacco product correct that's my understanding of what this bill would do and of course it it falls the foul of the nightshade issue simply because the other nightshade something i didn't know until 10 minutes ago contain apparently contains some nicotine that may explain why i like tomatoes so much who knows so chair barnard i also think that it's a probably a matter of degree my guess is that the tomato that you enjoy or the eggplant doesn't have a very large amount of nicotine in it and of course these products that we're talking about have much larger because the purpose is that again they're a mild so they're a stimulant we know that nicotine is a stimulant and also highly addictive and it's that that's what people are looking for which again i'm not sure people are eating tomatoes for the stimulation effects thank you the wiley tomato growers i didn't i had no idea anything else for this panel thank you very much thank you very much very much appreciate your testimony thank you uh kenny uh matthewson there was there was a simpsons cartoon about combining tobacco and i don't know if you have someone else for your panel or not no how about tomatoes and tobacco tomato simpson's episode about this all right so maybe that's where they got it thank you for sending those yes uh cher barnhart members of the committee katie tyson with the oregon nurses association i will keep my comments really brief here um just wanted to testify in support of the bill today because although we know that combustible tobacco products are the most dangerous there's certainly a lot of evidence that ona nurses are aware of that nicotine is equally bad and can cause a number of diseases from heart disease to lung disease so we just want to support taxing all nicotine products at their broadest capacity and that taco tobacco substitute products be regulated the same and that we know increasing the price of these products is the best way to curb youth access in particular so with that i'll be happy to answer any questions but just wanted to testify in support of the bill what do we know about the if anything at this stage about the nature of uh first use and and continued utilization of these products we've we've heard in other bills for example we've heard testimony how vaping may in fact for younger people lead to the use of of regular tobacco products um the nicotine is highly addicting i think at this by this by this point everyone should know that um what do we know about this the kind of product that we're trying to deal with here in that in in those areas epidemiologically i guess and probably i should have asked the epidemiologist this question yeah i i don't have a specific answer to you but um you know as nurses our members really believe that opening the door to any uh nicotine or tobacco product is a bad idea because of that sort of further down the line effect so i'd be happy to try and find that answer for you and get back to you because i think it is a really interesting idea chamber thank you dr hedberg did you have additional information on that point because if you do i'd love i think the committee would like to hear it yeah so chair barnard members of the committee we do know that the majority of people who are tobacco users or lifetime users started before the age of 18. so and at least before the age of 21 in other words nobody wakes up my age in their late 50s and says i think i'll try a cigarette it just doesn't happen people also don't start by not smoking today and then tomorrow becoming a pack a day smoker so we do know that the pattern of use is initially trying and that eventually there are some people who will try a few and stop but the majority of folks will try and then especially if it's it's part of the um the broader social or cultural group that they're in become addicted and pretty soon they are not able to quit all right and i i think your assumption it might very well be that products like zin nt will follow a similar pattern um so yes chair barnard so it's not clear to me um which product again we know that if you start with e-cigarettes uh the the kids i call them that youth who start often go over to other tobacco products that they don't necessarily say stay the same so my guess is that and we also know that products such as hookah which are tobacco but are flavored tobacco that that appeals to the youth because it's sort of easier to inhale and the same with e-cigarettes they often have candy flavors etc that appeal to youth and then they become addicted so i would say it is a fair assumption although again we don't have obviously data yet since oregon is just a test market about whether zen and t would end up the same way but my guess is that when you're using an oral product that's relatively easy to consume if you will it's not quite as harsh as a camel unfiltered cigarette is to start but it still contains nicotine that it's an addictive substance and that then that person may or has the potential for the lifetime of addiction thank you other questions thank you very much uh i'm sorry representative smith thank you mr not necessarily for the panel i just want to make sure i'm understanding this correctly so what we're talking about is a 65 percent of the whole sales sales price on all tobacco substitutes that's yes how did we how did we choose 65 is it just as out of convenience because that's the same rate for other tobacco products or was there another rationale there's nothing wrong if it's that convenience because it's the same as others i just i'm assuming that's the reason yeah mr chairman representative smith it is the same um couldn't speak to the reasons necessarily behind that except for some uniformity okay consideration that's always trying to get out thank you thank you mr chair thank you and i you know again we probably would need additional testimony on this topic but it occurs to me that you don't want to give advantage in the marketplace to one kind of ingestion system or or type then a different one and setting the tax in a similar level would would help with that uh process now that seems logical to me mr chairman i was just trying to make sure that was the reason thank you uh thank you very much thank you for your testimony uh joseph gilpatric and charles wyatt pleaser does not apply to nicaragua is there anyone else who wants to be heard today on this bill gentlemen thank you representative my name is joseph gilpatric um i was a 22 year smoker i i started smoking cigarettes at the age of about 15 years old um and my mother was a two pack a day smoker at the time when i when i'd be kind of smoking um well um prices of cigarettes increased through several decades um my mother still addicted to pack a day smoker um i just wanted to share um you know moments of when my mom decided if i should get my lunch money or a pack of cigarettes and you know an addicted person as as many people will testify you know tobacco is just as addictive as sometimes heroin or cocaine i and i urge you to you know maybe go down to the jail and talk to a heroin or cocaine dealer and ask them if they raise the price of their drugs how many people stop purchasing their products it doesn't seem to work that way so the more we raise these products on people that are already financially burdened you know these people that are addicted to tobacco um are in the lower class range you know 20 000 a year or less and so you know we we raise the price on these products that we know that they're going to purchase and pay for because they're addicted with the justification of saying that they're not going to purchase them anymore well well this is a 50-year smoker 45-year smoker now now these products in this bill particularly um you know as that zen enqueue that is a chewing gum that is designed exactly like nicoderm cq it's the um just a non-fda approved exact replica of that from a different company now as we know nicotine is not cancerous it is a stimulant like caffeine and it has a lot of health issues as far as people with heart problems but it is a much much healthier much safer alternative than smoking and for us to put it on an equal plane for a chewing gum a nicotine supplement and a cigar or some chew it just doesn't really make sense to me and for for you know um for for us to make a tax on something just because we know these people are going to pay for it shouldn't make it right and i i believe you guys know that true thank you very much thank you yes sir hello representative barn barnhart and members of the committee my name's charles wyatt and i just kind of want to start off by saying i think taxation against these products that have already been shown to be healthier not the best but to be healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes i think there should be no no taxation if somebody chooses to make a healthier option to work towards a healthier future then they shouldn't be financially burdened like joe said uh most of uh cigarette consumers are of the lower you know lower class don't make as much money and i want to make somebody that's making those healthier choices you know give them less of a financial burden like when we look at a look at new york who taxes our cigarettes at a it you know a staggering rate of 4.35 cents a pack um we notice when we look at the numbers that 58 percent of users get their cigarettes from black markets from out of state or just end up buying cheaper cigarettes to begin with and 58 that's almost 6 out of 10 people that buy cigarettes in new york state because of the taxation goes to other other revenues and if you think that that uh the person sneaking cigarettes across state lines is gonna id that person buying cigarettes then then you know that's gotta be a pretty honest person um pennsylvania and i understand vaping is not this hasn't anything to do with vaping um but seeing as other you know their other options of quitting smoking that that are um that are healthier than smoking you know pennsylvania passed a 40 tax on on vapor products and six months shut down 33 percent of establishments on you know selling those products and that's a lot of people losing their jobs alex clark from casa said it sounds like a bad joke but it's all too real pennsylvania vapers could go to prison for buying vapor products online and not paying a 40 tax on them the penalties for evading the tax includes up to a five thousand dollar fine or prison time not to exceed five years and the reality of that situation is that these taxes are allowing the government to go to somebody's house to somebody's house with a swat team and hold a gun to their head and force them into prison for tobacco or alternative products you know if i want if if these taxes were to pass on the way that i choose to consume nicotine i would be considered a criminal because i can afford those types of taxes and if it's between paying those taxes or putting a roof over my pregnant wife's head it's going to be putting a roof over my pregnant wife's head and and i am i am addicted to nicotine thank god i found a healthier alternative but all that being aside i just i don't see any philosophical consistency um with this and things like sugar when i was one year old one years old and drinking massive amounts of kool-aid and such sugar is a stimulant sugar is just as addictive as heroin and cocaine and you know they're they're the obesity crisis here's here's tobacco and here's obesity but i don't i don't see anybody you know i don't see any anybody saying anything about sugar and the the negative implications that sugar has on children and there's just no consistency and and for that reason i'm i just want to see people get healthy and i want to see people burning as little as they possibly can if they're making those those steps forward to become healthy thank you so much thank you very much for your testimony questions for this panel gentlemen thank you we appreciate your testimony thanks again with that we'll close the public hearing on house bill 3296 and reopen the public hearing on house bill 2363 and we'll see if any of the people who wanted to testify last time and didn't get to are back colleagues recall we we were hearing this uh thursday afternoon um and i my recollection is that there were three people who wanted best five we're down to run or maybe maybe the department's ready as well oh okay please are there those who are standing please come up plus wendy johnson please no no that's fine chair bernhard i didn't really want to testify but you gave me a little homework last week so i did yeah i did give you some homework why don't you state your name and then and then respond to the homework question um chair barnhart members of the committee mark arts with the department of revenue property tax division so last week if you recall you had a question at the end of the hearing for the department and you just basically asked if there were any safeguard or and you can certainly reset your question if you'd like but you basically asked if there were any safeguards in the bill that would protect the money that the county was already spending on a t and so you said your concern as i understand it was that because the county would have this new source of money in the two percent fee that they could charge the districts that they would just turn around and reduce their own contribution and so i think the short answer is that uh the bill as drafted or with the dash one amendment does not have a lot of that assurance in it but i want to let you know that i worked with representative brock smith and with representative marsh also was there and and we did a little bit of working on this to try and fine-tune what what an amendment that would take care of that might look like and so a couple of ideas that are out there and again the amendment's not drafted at this time and ultimately it'll be up to the to the sponsors of the bill as to what it looks like the department's neutral on whatever the policy would be but i think that we might be looking like some at something that might have a provision that basically says that while a county may have to reduce their budget because they simply don't have them the money that they would not be able to reduce their budget for a t for assessment taxation to any more degree than the overall budget reduction that the county goes through in any
yLXAxM-Kvqo,02-22-2016,3367,NJ,age for purchase and sales tobacco products and electronic smoking devices from 19 to 21. this bill uh has been heard in this committee not too long ago and passed with a very strong support and also passed both houses of the legislature uh and so i don't i think the issues on this piece of legislation are pretty clear um and so while i appreciate uh all those who wish to come up i hope that respective time you'll keep your comments and support um uh brief and uh we'll move forward and get this bill out and make it get it on its way and see if we can't do a better job of of getting it through the passage um mr david henry new jersey association of county city health officials in favor daniel is that kings or kenny a king oh that's a g is all right just two minutes good morning mr chairman and committee members my name is dave henry i'm the legislative chair for the new jersey association of county and city health officials um we've been on record before that we enthusiastically support um this legislation and we hope it passes again um currently there's 14 municipalities that have adopted local ordinances to raise the age of smoking to 21 and that has gone very well but we feel that state legislation would be more consistent across the state actually and again in order to keep my comments brief um we again support this uh very wholeheartedly and uh ask for uh uh um ask that it be passed thank you good morning my name is danielle king i'm an undergrad and graduate student at rutgers university i'm majoring in public health has health education and behavioral science um i am also a veteran and i served in the marine corps and deployed to afghanistan in 2009 through 2010. what encouraged me to speak today was the previous concern brought up in the senate committee two weeks ago which was the concern that military members should be allowed to smoke considering they were able to sign up for war we have an extreme duty to protect military members just like we raised the drinking age to 21 it is also equally important to raise the smoking age to 21. currently in the marine corps 30 percent of marine smoke in the army 26 smoke the institute of medicine conducted a study and found that um smoking reduces physical performance capacity lowered visual acuity and also resulted in poor night vision than non-smokers even the slightest effect on a person in combat can make the difference of life or death a recent tricare study shows that the rate of lung cancer in veterans may be as high as twice the rate of lung cancer in civilians costing the va and a low estimate of 1 billion a year even though smoking in the general population has decreased it has been steady in the military which has prompted military officials to try and figure out ways to reduce smoking this bill of raising the age of 21 could prevent 223 000 premature deaths to americans among among the born between the age of 2000 and 2019 according to the institute of medicine among those who could be saved from premature deaths will be those who served it is our duty to to protect veterans and make sure that the that the life they have after serving isn't in a hospital bed fighting lung cancer here today we have the opportunity to prevent people from smoking at a young age and prevent addiction thank you for your time well thank you ms king for bringing this this testimony before the panel it is an issue that has been raised and um i think you very eloquently spoke to it uh having served the military myself and you know everybody who serves uh what do we say we're the property of the federal government and we we follow orders some better than others and uh and so uh you know those who are in the service will um if you're not if you're not supposed to drink then you then you will not drink if you're not supposed to smoke then you're not gonna smoke so uh in the past of course we had we didn't know how dangerous smoking was and and smoking was used to deliver uh you know nicotine to help with appetite to help with study nerves focus the mind there are positive benefits actually to nicotine which um which ought to be said i guess but uh the the the detriments the um the negative side effects are so great and so overwhelming and we know that once that hook gets placed uh into a person at a young age that far too many will go on to smoke their entire lives and will die prematurely from uh from smoking so um perhaps it's more important than ever to make sure these rules are applied across our services to protect the many uh men and women who serve who serve there we want them around for a good time to come and preventing and getting them a little older to prevent them from smoking we'll um we'll go a long way to ensuring that that's so thank you uh next we're going to bring up um oh any questions i'm sorry mr green first of all i want to congratulate you on your testimony and also i do support what we're trying to accomplish but i would like to you gave us percentages of basically uh what's going on with the different branches of government i guess my concern is that have there been any pushback in terms of individuals saying i'm old enough to go to war but now you're telling me that i'm too young to be able to smoke what's the feeling among the people in the service when it comes down to the feeling their rights are violated i live in a world where i see so much no matter when you're helping a person you're doing the right thing for a person you're going to get that negative impact and i would just like to want to be in a position so that when i mention what percentage do smoke don't smoke and how do they feel in general about this particular issue is it being accepted because we're trying to do the best thing we can to help them with their health or is it being challenged there definitely is a challenge a lot of smokers feel very strongly about being able to smoke but at the same time there's proof that a lot of military members are trying to quit i think it's around 52 percent of those who do smoke have tried to stop quitting so i think if we can stop them from smoking at 21 before 21 that it would be in their best interest so in my opinion it doesn't really matter that they feel like oh i should smoke oh i should smoke it's more about what is good for their health and i feel like we have the opportunity to to help a person before they become addicted saying or how you feel about the issue in general so i think once we pass the law is it a way that once we start to educate them that we can win them over or they feel like their rights are being violated because you have some that's just against wars let's go back 50 years now against anything that we feel is the right thing to do but so many people nowadays feel that rights are being violated there's a person who's going to support this i like to be able to respond in a positive way other than we're telling you what's good for your body oh something i would just mention that you know we're trying to do something in the interest of public health and to promote long-term quality of health and prevent bad outcomes down the road i think what happens is in collaboration with a number of different parties and organizations i think it'll become more normal as time goes on that that we've raised or potentially raised the age of of uh tobacco purchasing but you know it's not only enforcement but it's health education it's health promotion you know in in so that people become normalized to this um i don't want to belabor too much time but i remember going to um bowling alleys where they used to be smoke-filled and then the smoke the smoke-free air act came around and now you know the bowling alleys were concerned that they would be affected economically but now i see parties on saturdays sundays it's a whole big family affair so i think what happens is you know it's not like we're trying to be big government we're just trying to uh provide an alternative to have people live healthier lives for a longer period of time thank you we're going to bring up i appreciate your testimony karen blumenfeld new jersey gasp uh maureen weber uh have a point of care is that that bell oh that's two t's a habit point of care amy barclay campaign for tobacco-free kids okay says 23.20 on here well come up for that bill it's got the right i guess rom um got the wrong bill number on there then ms bloom and fell two minutes it's good yes it's good i always get mislead when it's red which means no my mind as opposed to green um good morning everyone my name is karen blumenfeld i'm the executive director of the nonprofit global advisors on smoke free policy and i want to thank you chairman chairman um as well as the committee members that are here today that were supportive of the bill last term and again thank you again for being supportive of it um in this legislative session um our expertise is pretty wide when it comes to tobacco 21. one of the things that we do is we provide educational resources to the communities around the state of new jersey that want to do 21 on their own and just to share with you 16 towns in the state have done tobacco 21 and many more are in the process of doing it so there's definitely that grassroots local momentum to have this happen and as i go to town council meetings and board of health meetings on this i just want to share with you that i've really witnessed firsthand an enthusiasm and a commitment by local policy makers uh to try and help their town's young people not to start smoking and help people quit um and because of this many of them have passed their own local ordinances um hoping that it would be the impetus for the state to move forward on a statewide level um now sometimes have decided to wait um and so we're very thankful again that you all are looking at this initiative early on the legislative session and that it's already passed on the senate health committee side as well just a couple of things i want to share policies that reduce teen and young adults access to tobacco have been shown to lower smoking initiation rates and it's obvious that less tobacco use will translate into lowered smoking-related healthcare costs it's obvious that um in new jersey we spend three billion dollars a year in smoking related health care costs so an initiative like this which is uh has virtually no cost whatsoever except for most likely putting up signs is something that can definitely help last year a federal study showed that 250 000 lies would be saved if tobacco were raised for sale to age 21 and older and that's why the new jersey chapter of the american college of physicians as well as their national organization and the american medical association also support this a note on e-cigarettes it's not a footnote i can't say anymore because this last year's study showed that a triple increase in young people using electronic smoking devices we're glad to see that it's continuing to be in this particular bill because as i noted the increased use in youth using these products plus there's no marketing or advertising restrictions uh on e-cigarettes new jersey was the first first date to ban the use of electronic smoking devices back in 2010 so we're proud of that and we're also proud of new jersey for last year um our last session um passing the the law that requires child resistant packaging um thank you to um assault women pink and for that and others that were involved there's also peer-reviewed studies that conclude electronic smoking devices not only hazardous to the people that use them but hazardous to innocent bystanders that breathe in the air so the bottom line is that tobacco 21 initiatives they do reduce smoking they do improve health outcomes and they will save taxpayer dollars and i just have one quick question uh about the bill if i may um because there are communities that are passing this policy i just have a question to confirm that the bill does not preempt local towns from doing these types of policies if it were to pass just like the smoke-free air act has a no preemption clause in it that allows towns to do more we wanted to ask the question uh about to confirm whether or not that unless hasn't been thought about yet but um we would prefer that there be clarity when it comes to no preemption just because of the history of new jersey with always starting on the local level and then moving to the state level and thanking those that have been the forerunners um in this particular area thank you well as i understand the bill it does will preempt state law general and you know when there's an overlap we'll prevent local ordinances and as i understand it that's the case here but the goal has been accomplished in any case and hopefully people can still if they want credit um can take a healthy chunk of responsibility for getting state to do the right thing so let's focus on the positive thank you thank you chairman conaway i'm amy barclay i'm with the campaign for tobacco-free how's that okay i'm amy barkley i'm with the campaign for tobacco-free kids and we're based in washington dc we're a national organization that monitors tobacco prevention policy change and supports that change in all the states throughout the country and i just want to make one point because karen made the case uh very well for the for the bill itself but i wanted to let you know that really the eyes of the public health community nationally are on new jersey those of you who served the state for a while know that historically new jersey's been a leader in tobacco prevention efforts and unfortunately now has the dubious distinction of being the only state that's not using tobacco-related revenues to fund tobacco prevention and cessation and consequently you know progress on youth smoking is stalling somewhat so we'd like to see new jersey return to its leadership position and become the second state after hawaii to pass this legislation to raise the age of sale for tobacco to 21. and thanks to those of you who have supported this legislation before thank you we're going to move on uh next well just note that mr lykins representing the march of dimes is in favor no need to testify michelle is on medical side of new jersey in favor of need to testify mrs orlando american heart association in favor and i need to testify a deborah brown american lung association in favor of to testify even hasbro american cancer society whose testimony has been submitted in favor and i need to testify in noah uh new jersey society for respiratory care and favor no need to testify uh diane litterer uh new jersey prevention network in favor and i need to testify libby vinson and new jersey ymca state alliance in favor no need to testify uh sal ris salvato new jersey gasoline and convenience store association opposed mister mr chairman you need to testify uh mary allen papard new jersey food council opposed no need to testify uh rich levesque new jersey vapor retailers coalition um opposed and i need to testify actually i'd like to hear from rich but we have um maybe some other time john holland new jersey retail merchant's association uh opposed uh no need to testify uh anyone else on this legislation that i perhaps missed i'll entertain a motion on this uh bill i'm just useless miss some uh mr stumpter uh mr frankie called the rule on the motion to report assembly bill two three two zero assemblywoman pc um come on i and this is gonna actually surprise some people in my vote but um i'm very consistent on if you're old enough to essentially do everything um i i don't like picking and choosing and saying even i mean i'm somebody who would lower the drinking age so on this i'm gonna know some lumen peterson look i don't advocate for smoking never spoke myself never have any intention of smoke but um like holly i think we have to have some consistency when somebody's an adult can make adult decisions either they're an adult at 18 or 19 or 20 or 21 it used to be a time in this country that 21 was when you became an adult we changed that because people could sign up and go fight in a war make the ultimate sacrifice at 18. so we changed everything 18 and now we're slowly coming back to 21 on everything and i think maybe that's where it should be 21 for everything and if smoking is so bad maybe we should just outlaw tobacco and we should stop talking in this legislature about legalizing marijuana which is no better so we should be consistent we send a message to our children when we say don't smoke but we're going to legalize marijuana we send them this conflicting message and kids are smart and i've been at a dare ceremony where a ten-year-old asked that question it's legal in colorado why isn't it why why is it bad why can't you smoke they asked that question we need to be consistent so i hope that this body if you really think tobacco is that bad and it is against we should be against legalizing marijuana as well because well that's another bill and i've provided some too but on that i'm going to be consistent and vote now okay look forward to your bill to raise the adulthood the age of adulthood 21. that might not actually be a bad idea i'm going to be consistent and vote yes and uh marijuana in these other states is consumed by gummy bears so we have to be careful about legalizing marijuana because i agree with eric on that is that there's that up for vote today i don't know i know but i'm being consistent i want to get on voting yes i i there you go yes i'm voting yes let's go that's your dub summary woman to crouch there you go assemblywoman sumpter chairman i'm going to hold my peace and just vote yes assemblywoman thinking assemblywoman mcknight solomon kennedy assemblywoman jimenez assemblyman green i'm voting yes but i would like to make a statement in terms of my position on this particular issue one i'm going to support it because i feel that we should educate the young people and we should be able to look out for people health who don't look up their own health but again we need to be consistent in terms of people rights so my reasoning for wanting to put it on record is that if we're going to basically say what's good and what's bad then we have to take a stand when we talk about people rights in general so that's my reason for voting the way i'm voting someone benson vice chairman eustace i'm going to vote yes but i agree with some of my colleagues about the age of people being able to serve in the military and making rules about what they can do about what their age of adulthood is i do think that we should spend more money on smoking cessation programs and that should come out of the tobacco revenues and i think that would be a better direction to go i think any way to reduce habitual problems is a great way to go i'm just not a fan of assigning ages to it and uh to assemblyman peterson i hope you feel that way about booze it costs us a lot of money federally and state wise to take care of problems created by alcohol addiction thank you you don't need to respond to that now we we have that's been said about this question of age and i'm just going to say if i would invite members of this committee and members of the public to uh to bring to our attention uh the um the various pros and cons of raising uh the age of majority uh to 21. i think you do make a good point about consistency there although you know you have you know governments are frequently inconsistent and you can uh and they are rather easily explained with legitimacy of war needing to have you know well and able-bodied people uh serving in the military that might might particularly given the control environment uh the command control structure within the military that might um you know it's a very different thing uh from freely entering into a contract by a house to do other things i think i think there are distinctions there which are important where the military is concerned which really in my mind don't make the military unique and really not critical to decisions on this issue so i would say yes happily and thank this committee for their time and let's hope we can get this this ball past the line this time and the bill is reported next we'll take up a 2332 benson s 976 gordon beck requires public health council to promulgate rules and regulations for the use of quality control programs and bioanalytical and clinical laboratories mr benson comments on this this past last term again the goal here this bill is to update department regulations to allow a whole host of testing that's done on a regular basis and allowed to be done with fewer regulations because of the near the the certainty of uh of no errors or if there was an error there is no harm to the patient these are already approved at the federal level this is just getting the state to approve to promulgate new regulations to expand the very smallest they currently have to now match what's at the federal level this reduces costs obviously for patients it also provides greater access for these testing in greater locations great uh we have ms maureen weber in favor ms webber representing abbott point of care thank you chairman and thank you to the committee for allowing me to be here today and to speak in favor of this bill i feel very strongly um that this will help health care in the state and it will also have some focus on reduced cost for health care in the state i do work for abbott point of care evident point of care is a vendor of laboratory testing devices the type of device that we provide is one that's brought to the patient it's brought to the point of care and it offers both waived laboratory tests which are these simple tests that the fda has said are so easy to perform that the likelihood of getting an erroneous result is negligible and also moderate complexity test and i bring that up just so that you're aware in the state we can't even sell our instrument because the state only recognizes eight wave tests these tests were from an old version of federal regulation and the state has not kept in pace with that federal regulation the state has a clinical laboratory improvement act that is from 1975 and they have not updated that it's based on an old federal act from 1967 so we've had conversations with the department of health and ask have they increased their ability to revise the requirements for the state have they made any efforts on that for years we've heard that they're making efforts on this well in looking at why it might level review of the bill we thank the sponsor for his support and uh i'm happy to entertain any questions or comments that anyone has missed mcduck hi how are you is there a reason why for-profit hospitals are not included uh that's an issue we're happy to work with the sponsors on on the bill with and you know it's i don't think that's the uh the the hill for my client these the to die on okay thank you [Laughter] you could live i don't know get that flag raised up there you know we're going to charge the hill and get the flag raises anyone else on anyone else for mr manning on this bill i would note that dr mitch reicher president of the jersey orthopedic society is in favor of this bill but does not feel he needs to testify uh anyone else on this legislation if not i'll entertain a motion on the bill miss jimenez uh miss pinken uh mr frankie call the rule on the motion to report assembly bill 3101 assemblywoman to pc assemblyman peterson yes assemblywoman munoz assemblywoman to crouch assemblywoman's sumpter assemblywoman pinking assemblywoman mcknight yes with the exception of adding for-profit hospitals assemblyman kennedy assemblywoman jimenez assemblyman green uh sublime benson vice chairman eustis yes chairman conaway yes the bill is reported thank you next we'll take up ajr 50 rumbly conway venery huddle designates may of each year as youth smoking prevention and awareness month we have a number of people who need to be recognized in this bill i recognized only i suspect i hope uh uh ethan has broken the american cancer society in favor and i need to testify lynn nelson jersey society respiratory care in favor no need to testify karen blumenfeld new jersey gasp in favor no need to testify david henry uh new jersey associates of county city health officers in favor and i need to testify libby vincent new jersey ymca state alliance in favor and i need to testify uh sharon seiler new jersey school board association in favor need to testify and anna ahanzi is njea in favor no need to testify uh with that i'll to entertain a motion on the resolution the sumpter is mr eustis mr frankie paul rule on the motion to report assembly joint resolution 50. assembly woman or assemblyman peterson assemblywoman munoz assemblywoman to crouch assemblywoman sumter assemblywomanpinkin yes i just want to make a note that i was a sponsor on the last version and we'll sign up again to be a sponsor on this version as well thank you assemblywoman mcknight someone kennedy that's one that i'm thinking about assemblywoman in jimenez assemblyman green sumlim and benson vice chairman eustis chairman conway yes the resolution is reported it's real pain and it's detriment to good patient outcome next i guess we'll adjourn this hearing mr greene and issue that we really talked a lot about and maybe uh something women also want to add to it uh this tier type of control over what insurance companies do is that regulated by the governor's office or do we have the input could we have a hearing on that particular issue because i know the majority of the mayors in union county feel that this is really hurting their ability to offer the kind of services they need to offer and also it almost puts them in a situation where they're losing control so i guess my question to you the decision in which way we go with this particular issue is that something that can come through our body of government or is that something that the governor's office controls uh something wrong with munoz if you want to add on to what i'm talking about i appreciate it you do you i know that you were sullivan you were at the uh press conference last week talking about the omnia obviously horizon healthcare and the issue regarding access to care i know you're in burlington county we're in union county um and trinitas hospital which is a major provider is not one of the tier one hospitals but i think we're you know someone green and i and the people in our area as well as your area are very concerned with this classifying things as tier one and the potential to drive these really excellent hospitals out of business because they're forcing all the patients into the the wealth the paying patients into the tier ones so i that's what someone green is addressing and whether or not we're going to do it take it up here you want me to finish what the question was we're going to take it up here or at some other venue well you've i i i've said well a couple times there because the the uh omnia and i should say not omni but rather tiered networks are not on the agenda today we um we have taken up as you uh know uh in this committee and there have been a number of bills uh that have uh been offered uh which uh and a number of them are now uh in other committees it's not to say that this committee um will not take up further the issue of tier networks but it is an issue that will be taken
O3FKuoQQuhQ,06-01-2017,3831,NJ,in favor of no need to testify by both dennis hart uh chemistry council andrew muslick new jersey business industry lauren uh little khan new jersey chamber of commerce christine renna sether is the chamber of commerce all in favor of testify the chair thanks them for their participation and motion to release please motion made second heard roll call on a 3265. miss munoz yes miss phoebus yes miss shapisi ms caraday mr conaway uh any affirmative miss lampet yes miss mascara mr lagana chairman versus kelly uh yes those released thank you and we've all now for the title please of a 23 20 23 20 and its companion bill s 359 assembly bill number 2320 and senate bill number 359 raised the minimum age for purchase and sale of tobacco products and electronic smoking devices from 19 to 21. thank you although i have great reservations anytime we do something away from the age of majority there's interesting testimony around this of a certain previous committee we have a number of slips have been uh submitted both in a pose and in favor of uh with no need to testify the record will reflect them we have uh karen blumenfeld uh global advisers smoking policy in favor uh and karen do you feel need to testify are you here do you that's 30 seconds sounds very good if if the chairman share was here that would give him time for a quick cigarette and also let me call up uh corinne again orlando the american heart association corrine now now that makes me feel that you hurt my feelings because now i feel that you weren't properly treated last time are you certain i'd say i didn't think you could help yourself did you want to come forward thank you thank you okay karen can you speak on the appropriations side absolutely okay since the focus is on fiscal testimony uh i'm karen blumenfeld executive director of global advisors on smoke free policy and i just wanted to note as referenced in ols's fiscal note that raising the age to 21 will reduce the negative health outcomes in our state for those who don't start smoking between the ages of 19 to 21 and that can possibly impact the state budget by saving on state health care costs from young adults that don't start and to help smokers quit and in addition there is no fiscal impact on retailers because they already proof people that want to purchase if they look under the age of 27. and just an fyi nationwide there are 230 uh jurisdictions that now uh raise the age to 21 that cover 66 million people in our nation that's 20 percent of the population and two dozen towns in new jersey have done it thank you so you were drifting away from the appropriations discussion there you did a very nice little thank you thank you so much corinne now there's that was very dynamic testimony is there anything you could possibly add to that on the appropriation side thank you very much and we appreciate the american heart association thank you uh seniors testify motion to release motion based second heard roll call please on a 2320 in s 359. miss munoz yes miss phoebus mr peasy real brief uh smoking's a dumb habit i did it for years but i also know if you can go and fight for our country and get married and do a whole host of things you can make your own decision so i'm gonna know miss carradine yes mr conaway hello miss lampet yes miss mascara yes mr laganna yes chairman bursa kelly uh yes and bill's release thank you now the title on a3798 and senate bill 211. assembly bill number 3798 and senate bill number 211 authorizes the use of school bus monitoring system let me sort through some cards here we have a lot of them [Applause] we have a tremendous amount of cards uh submitted with in favor and i need to testify which we're grateful for this bill has been heard the previous committee let me just make sure this will be a long record that's being established that itself is not a bad thing we have a trevor jackson before towns board of education in favor i'm sorry it's chivia trivia how do you pronounce that trevor you were right the first time and now you're just appeared by magic i was looking down the whole thing in there and there you were all right and who else was with you elliot cologne oh we have your card now both of you are in favor and felt you're compelled to speak what can you add to the record about the appropriations side of this um well first of all thank you for hearing us today um as far as appropriations school buses are passed continuously all the time regardless if the red lights are out in denver township we see it all the time on a informal survey one day 22 times the bus was passed our buses were passed another day 34. drivers are not held accountable because and i don't mean to be disrespectful we know all that the previous committee heard that established a very good record he did so today's discussion is limited to the state's investment which i see no appropriation on the state side here there isn't really but without this bill um districts like myself and effort we cannot just put cameras on because it's about a ten thousand dollar cost um to not even equip half of our fleet okay so we need the ability to be able to work with the vendors and negotiate underscore percentage so the bill will allow that the district can use an outside vendor who supplies the equipment and then the equipment interfaces with the police department who decides whether or not to issue a summons correct so the summons is not automatically issued as it was with red light cameras correct the the issue is decided by the police as if they sold in person right whether or not the issue was summoned yes the bus driver would have to inform transportation who would release the tape just for clarification the record how many buses does that for township run which is a sizable community for those who don't know we have about 4 000 students that we transport daily so we have about 60 buses just within district that's not our out of district also very good ellie cared at anything thank you david thank you thank you for being here and uh please understand that this committee functions a little different than others this case has been well made and we appreciate you being here and all those who signed slips thank you any questions seeing them thank you folks chair entertain a motion to release a 3798 and s211 miss munoz i'm going to have seen on the bill i have i mean obviously we don't want our children to be safe but you know we have some compelling testimony from
OYhv4v5qz0c,04-01-2016,3406,VT,year have included the health department working in conjunction with vgip which is the vermont children's health improvement program at uvm which is known for its quality improvement efforts we conducted a survey of healthcare providers but 140 healthcare providers participated in that survey the survey was specifically focused on looking at current attitudes knowledge and practice related to larc and identifying training priorities as a result of the survey we have put together a training series which is currently underway it's included three webinars and will also include an in-person component so that's been a significant part of our efforts over the past year we've also provided training to community level providers and practitioners such as home visitors members of maternal and health coalitions maternal and child health coalitions and facilitators of teen pregnancy prevention programs across the state to share current research and best practices on contraceptive options and approaches to counseling and to make sure that these community partners are aware of of providers in the community that are offering comprehensive contraceptive services we've also participated in a national quality improvement initiative which is known as a coin which stands for collaborative improvement and innovation network and these have been taken up across the country around several critical areas the one that our work has focused on relates to infant mortality reduction this initiative has helped states including our own focus on several key areas of work that have included improving preconception health increasing access to highly effective contraception improving interconception care and other related issues such as working to reduce smoking during pregnancy can i ask you a question yes please i i missed a very specific link between family planning and healthy babies i did i did and i can reiterate that if you'd like can i get us this in writing i can i can i'm happy to send you a copy it's outlined yes thank you shall i continue yes so our efforts in vermont related to improving access to highly effective contraceptives and best practice approaches have really been in line with and informed by the national focus on and momentum around ensuring that women have access to highly effective contraceptive methods so some things that we know about larks in particular long-acting reversible contraception methods are highly effective in preventing pregnancy we know during the first year of typical use fewer than 1 in 100 women using an iud or an implant will become pregnant comparatively oral contraceptives have a higher failure rate there will be nine pregnancies per 100 women per year over the long term the guttmacher institute which is a national research entity that provides a lot of in-depth data on on family planning they estimate that larc methods are 20 times more effective than other moderately effective methods and that includes the birth control pill the patch or the ring we also know that lark methods are safe and have high acceptability major professional medical societies and prominent health organizations endorse making larcs readily available to both women and teens the centers for medicare and medicaid services the children's health insurance program recognized larx as a critical tool for reducing unintended pregnancies the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists also known as acog recommends that larc methods be available to women without unnecessary burden or delay acog advises healthcare providers to offer same-day larc insertion whenever possible to best meet patients needs and both acog and the american academy of pediatrics endorse larks for teens the centers for disease control and prevention recommends preventing unintended pregnancy by removing barriers to larc use by reimbursing providers for full range of contraceptive services so these would include screening for pregnancy intention using what's called a tiered contraceptive counseling approach which is really the the standard best recommended practice insertion removal replacement or reinsertion of larks or other contraceptive devices and finally as dr gibson shared we know that most women choose a lark when they have affordable access to and sufficient knowledge about all contraceptive methods there's a very succinct evidence summary that has come out of the cdc's initiative called 618 which has identified six key public health priorities to improve health and reduce health care costs five of them are in the realm of chronic disease six relates to unintended pregnancy and the strategies that are identified um really provide very clear guidance for for payers in particular and i'd like to um if you think this would be helpful provide this to the committee as a follow-up um to my testimony today yes i will be sure to like that i'd like to stop there and see if you have any questions for me questions for the community so you give us this data in writing yes are there questions that we should have asked you that we didn't think to ask you one i'm looking for the data on what's our team pregnancy rate right now in in vermont i know we've been one of the lower ones we are one of the lower we're second to new hampshire um i thought it would be second to none i know what's that um do you want to respond to that or should i respond to that you have that data um i was looking for it but again just to reiterate that is you know vicious circle right somebody who's taking care of these young people who've had traumatic lives and now are highly at risk and woodside are you know heading into an adulthood more trauma and pain and then are going to be a reproductive age and be able to have children it's hard to know where we can jump in to make it stop we'd have to jump in everywhere that makes sense okay i think that's it thank you very much we have a couple of minutes do we need does the team need to break for five minutes okay and then we'll start an e-cigarette and also for those in the room you may notice that i stand up but it's not because i'm tired of you it's because i'm tired of sitting okay sure jennifer carvey legislative council um so we'll just talk a little bit about h171 the the main thing that this bill does is to prohibit using an e-cigarette in the same places where smoking a regular tobacco cigarette is prohibited can you tell us where that is that's your next thing where that is yeah where is smoking my habit you're going to get there we'll go yes we'll go through some of it i just wanted to give you kind of the overview um the other thing that the build does is limit where stores can display and store their cigarettes and electronic cigarettes so under current law they're prohibited from displaying or storing cigarettes and e-cigarettes where there and it says with where they are accessible to consumers without direct assistance by the sales personnel and this would change that uh to say that it they can be displayed or stored only behind a sales counter or in any other area of an establishment inaccessible to the public or in a locked container that is not located on a sales counter so the main well so this is for cigarettes and e-cigarettes both oh this is changing changing that so the main thing that's really different for this is that stores can't have a box on the counter where they have you know clear glass and you can see through to what the products are that would this bill would prohibit that it can't be in a locked container it can't be in a container on the sales counter it has to be in a lock container not on a sales counter or behind the sales counter or somewhere else that's not accessible to the public so they can have extras in the back room that's okay so so it bans using cigarettes anywhere where regular cigarettes are prohibited including in a workplace which under current law smoking a regular cigarette is prohibited in any workplace which is an enclosed structure where employees perform services for an employer including bars restaurants and hotel and motel rooms and you might remember doing some work on this in the past smoking in public places and where that would be what's considered public places the bill does create an exemption in a couple of places for what people often call a vaping lounge which is a business that doesn't sell food or beverage but is established for the sole purpose of providing a place for patrons to buy and use e-cigarettes and related paraphernalia so they might buy their e-cigarettes or supplies and then there might be a room attached where they could go and use their e-cigarettes that would still be allowed under the bill at least under the bill as past the house and it also the bill adds an exist adds to an existing exception for smoking in areas of the veteran's home where smoking is allowed you'd be able to use your e-cigarettes there as well so there's all it also prohibits using electronic cigarettes in places of public and uh public places which are common areas of all enclosed indoor places of public access and publicly owned buildings and offices including restaurants bars museums libraries laundromats malls the common areas of hospitals and nursing homes it's the whole long list we have in statute also in enclosed places of resorts hotels and motels including guest rooms in designated smoke-free areas of property or grounds owned by or released to the state and then there's the um 25-foot buffer zone around state buildings where no smoking is allowed and also like private things like the bfw uh well to the extent that a vfw is uh we don't have any specific exemption to the extent that they are a restaurant bar etc we don't have an exemption for them in existing laws so this is every place where smoking is not allowed the proposal is that using an e-cigarette is not vitamin e it's baby yes i think you can say okay um right and so again there's the exception for vaping lounges and there's the exception for the designated smoking area at the vermont veterans home and and this also includes using an e-cigarette in a motor vehicle where there's a child present who's under the age of eight which is the same thing you have an existing law for smoking do you know if we've ever had anybody picked up for smoking in a car i don't know i've seen some nuts i could rumors say that yeah little talk with our guests yes okay so yeah i'm sure i'm sure we could find out yeah so do you have any questions i mean the main thing here main takeaways from the bill is it adds the ban on smoking e-cigarettes wherever you can't smoke a regular cigarette and also has the prohibitions on where in stores cigarettes and e-cigarettes can be displayed and stored okay i'll be over here thank you jim we haven't had you in this video for quite a while good afternoon or good morning or whatever thank you for watching sorry it's been a long day already you know all of us don't you i do okay for the record my name is jim harrison i represent the vermont retail and grocers association i'm here to comment on h171 as it came over from the house did you send us your remarks no i didn't because they are here which is got a short attention span so i will be very brief but i do have something i will pass out that i will send to chrissy electronically um i hope this one was doing our homework um and it helps me what put other people say um so very quickly uh i am not here to comment on the probably the main part of the bill which is the smoking and public places i'll let that discussion for you folks and for others i am here to comment on the first part of the bill section one which has to do with the display of products and where a store can place e-cigarettes as you know existing law is already pretty stringent for tobacco products in terms of their accessibility in display in stores they cannot be accessible directly by the customer so this bill in e-cigarettes are covered in that currently this bill um gets more prescriptive in that they still can't be accessible by the customer but they can also not be on the counter uh even if they're not accessible today they can behind those glass glass things like that yes in other words you could have a counter today you could have um and i'll show you a picture here's here's a store across the street they do have an e-cigarette display it's on the end of the counter it's not even accessible from the front side because if you look closely there's a refrigerator cooler so you can't even get over there but the customer cannot reach over and get it it's the clerk has to get it from the other side it's a backfill this is the deli across the street next to the hotel and the concern i raise is this is a picture of the same store with the behind the counter so they don't have a lot it's a very small store they don't have a lot of behind the counter opportunity unless they just want to block the rest of the window that they have and my concern is that essentially small stores like that their option may be to just not carry and the advocates of the legislation might say that's a good outcome i would argue that you're taking an opportunity away for that store to sell a legal product and the only ones that can sell it are stores that perhaps are a little bit bigger have more space or more behind the counter i live in a town with a small country store that has a u-shaped counter so they don't have any behind the counter space and i don't know where i mean yeah they could put it on a gondola and lock it and every time someone wanted to you know it's like okay and i'll leave the register and go down to the aisle and unlock it it's not practical what's that yeah i'm sorry groceries you know the shelving yeah yeah yeah yeah what is this this is called a gondola i'm sorry i i yeah i'm sorry no word yeah um i was just thinking of the ski left that's all yeah yeah i'm sorry um my past is catching up with me i used to stock those gondolas um but so so it's allowed but and locked up but not really practical so the practical part is to put it behind the counter or put it you know on the shelf and if you don't have that behind a counter option the only thing you have is a counter so what i would suggest in the spirit of compromise is that you consider amending the house past language slightly and that is and this is what i will send to you electronic whatever i happy to share but essentially it it says not only current law says it just doesn't have to be locked it just has not have to be accessible to the customer i'm saying okay so if there's a concern that somehow someone can reach behind and okay let's let's require them if they're going to be on the counter that they're locked i think that's what new york says new york state does that they're locked don't totally remove that option of being on the counter a lot of small stores have one limited counter space and two more importantly limited behind the counter space additionally as you may know with the refill products there's a variety of nicotine so you can keep weaning yourself down and there's people in this room that know a whole lot more about it and eventually get to zero if you if it's behind the counter sometimes you can't even you can't see it so you're you may be asking for the high nicotine fix when you really wanted a you know a lower number so i i just ask for you to consider that so yes behind a sales counter that's that's sort of consistent with current law but if you're going to put on this sales counter or or if you're going to put it on the gondola locket and and the house bill does allow it for on the gondola if it's locked and all i'm saying is don't take away that option for the sales counter so jim would that resemble in some way the gondolas that uh feed lottery tickets where you could see them but you can't under current law you you can do that today you could put them where the lottery tickets are lottery tickets are typically not accessible by the customer i'm talking the scratch-off points yeah the clerk is the one that's pulling them up that's allowed today or is that because people don't want us to steal them probably the latter and probably because those display come from the lottery and that's the way they're made [Music] that's allowed today and that's that display over there is the same thing it's accessible from the back it's a backfill the house pass build that display has got to disappear it's got to be gone it's it's got to be put yeah you know in front of the window that's behind the counter or not sell it and and i understand there are a lot of folks that for whatever reason don't like e6 i don't like the name e6 because it's really not they're not cigarettes it's a vapor product it's not tobacco now i'm not going to argue that they're healthy for you but they're certainly a lot less harmful than tobacco having said that that's my train of thought it it seems to me you know the fee bill includes a new license to sell e6 50 yesterday the house passed a tax on e6 that's going to double the price so if those two things happen we're going to see very few stores carrying and if that's the intent then you will have succeeded i'm just saying if you're not if that's not the intent then don't handcuff the retailer one more way by saying you know you can't have it on the counter even if it's locked so jim if your fewer stores will carry them is that because they only have customers who can't afford e-cigs the tax part that will be the case because the tax is a pass-through so if you double the price i don't know why anybody would buy them in vermont because new hampshire massachusetts new york none of those states currently tax them we have a six percent sales tax on but we don't have a some type of excise tax so if you double the price of them you know why would you buy them in vermont you can buy them on the internet which is not really age restricted without a tax and you can buy many of the surrounding states without a tax so that's the tax issue the display issue is you will have fewer re retailers selling them because they don't have a viable option they got a little bit of a real estate like you do across the street um so what do i do other than put it on the counter locked up and what do you know just it's a specific one you may not be able to answer in stores that sell only vapor products are they allowed well they are obviously you just said they're allowed to have them on the counter now but and i represent one of the ones that's in castleton and i've been in there a couple times not to purchase necessarily just kind of get a feel so i don't remember how though the store is laid out but do most of them use behind a glass kind of display you know in other words yeah that may impact them differently than a store that sells other stuff that we have still here in stores yes we can find that out okay um but in the existing law there i think there's something in there for an age restricted store that may not be copied over about being able to sell that yeah that does the stores that sell just vapes or e6 you have to be 21 to go in or 18. there was something like that well you can't sell to a person you can't sell e-cigarettes to someone under the age of 18. i don't think there's anything in law that restricts the age of entering the store um but i think some have voluntarily some some stores so we hear from the woman in castleton yes i think she's the one i heard from as well that she had chosen to do so okay i i have a question for you i understand could you make it a little easier than senator coleman i'm sorry zero for one this is about mark okay yeah so um when when items are placed in the store they're they're premium placements where you'll get a lot of visibility and then there are placements where people are going to buy it anyway like milk or something there are end cap things that people pay a lot more for and then there's the stuff that you have to practically stand on your head to reach out to the bottom of the bin right so is that what's behind um moving the e-cigs so it's not i mean they put all the loop they used to have the candy bars and that and the magazines with the frozen bar on the cover right next to the cash register while you wait in line yeah but um i'll i'll give you an hour impulse buys on this issue i do not know the answer to that um it would be interesting to know if that was part of something the appeal of it is affected by that if that's the reason for doing that um it's obviously the answer is going to be different for different types of retailers i had a conversation with a representative of cumberland farms the other day this ban wouldn't apply to them because they have i mean their stories are configured that they can and all i'm trying to say is not all stores are physically treated equal and as they've renovated and remodeled they've been able to adjust to you know changing laws regulations expectations and have these types of products behind the counter so if it were money i would think someone like cumberland farms would be in a position to um would be you know multiplying number of stores it would be very important to them but it wasn't because they physically configured so thank you very much thank you okay thank you for the opportunity yes okay [Music] and she has written testimony in your ipads it's not looking great for you guys but we might end up with five minutes and she sent us we have two things from her on our ipads if you have iphones with you you can hi this is abby roger good morning abby this is claire aaronson health and welfare and around the committee around the room we have other members of the committee and a number of members of the public so um we would like to hear what you have to say and i figure you have about 10 minutes okay great thank you okay thanks go ahead introduce yourself and and tell us why you're an important witness for us yes yes uh first i want to thank the committee um for their time today um to listen uh to what the merchandise position is on e-cigarettes um we're support we're in support of the bill who uh have regulations on e-cigarettes um h-171 um the march of dimes works in um and abby for the record your name uh oh sorry abigail rogers i'm the director of advocacy and government relations for the march of dimes in the new england region okay thank you sure um and for those of you that need a refresher on what we do in the state um we were to improve health of women of child uh bearing age infants uh by preventing birth defects premature birth and infant mortality and uh a lot of our work is to help women ensure ensure women are having healthy pregnancies and many times the way to do that is to help women become healthy before they uh before they become pregnant um we're particularly concerned with e-cigarettes and the increasing use of those um we found in talking with providers that a lot of women who become pregnant who are smokers will then try to transition over to e-cigarettes and there's not just not enough evidence i mean there's a lot of toxins in them as well as nicotine so um the provider community as well as the folks that we work with really look looking for our partners in government to put place some restrictions on these as i said the use is increasing in women of child bearing age and uh as far as the nicotine piece goes no amount of nicotine has proven to be safe during pregnancy um as i said people believe that e-cigarettes may be safer than actual traditional cigarettes but the research is sort of out on that and then it is not a helpful helpful thing for women to be using either tobacco or e-cigarette replacements um during pregnancy and especially there's been a big rise of the use of e-cigarettes in the teenage population which means that future reproductive health and future birth outcomes of these people may be impacted um as you may know there they consist of an e-liquid cartridge they have the vapor has been indicated to have various levels of carcinogenic and toxic compounds also found in traditional cigarettes including tobacco specific nitrosamines and [Music] a glycol substance which is a poisonous solvent the liquids have been shown to contain heavy metals such as lead and chromium and nickel so the consequences of human health from repeated exposure is currently unknown but it doesn't sound very good to us certainly and we would like to place restrictions on these one study that we quote a lot in relation to e-cigarettes is that the liquid flavorings that they use may have a more toxic effect actually on the embryonic stem cells than on adult cells suggesting that a developer can see this may be more susceptible to that toxic plasticity and so we appreciate you looking at placing restrictions on this um the merchandise believes that ether red should be subject to the same laws and regulations of cigarettes and tobacco products um restricting youth access to e-cigarettes is important to protect the future of reproductive health of the youth in vermont and especially women of childbearing age should be educated about the risks to their unburned children and use of e-cigarettes and so we support this legislation to place these restrictions so that's my testimony and if anybody has any questions i'd be happy to answer them thank you questions thank you for sending along the testimony i mean it's great it's great to have it in print great okay well thank you for your time today thank you um community we have three people three and young people who came in just thinking they might be interested in seeing what that we actually have for but three or one group are interested and we're interested in the political process and came to hear what we have you know what we're doing and that sort of thing do you want to take five seconds and say what you think it is you know just introduce yourself and say you're here in support of e-cigarettes is that correct yes yeah and why my name is amy donnell i'm a martial employee at champ um everyone in my household was a smoker my mom and dad were heavy smokers my sister's fiance was my mom actually got diagnosed with cancer and so the doctor actually gave her a choice to either stop smoking or she continued down in that path in general and we introduced her to vaping and the doctor said her lungs have never been healthier since she actually stopped smoking she's cut back a lot there's when people come into our shop our models are we trying to get your stocks we do not sell e-cigarettes as people say we sell mods thank you so much no they're actually um i would say they're actually full-sized vaporizers so not just the little cartridge you get from like a gas station or another store these are actually full-sized vaporizers that has a full-size tank what's your name first ones um also polyester now these are a little different than the cartridges are there no no no it's still still a juice that holds it's nicotine containing that's what kind of goes juice it's a little bit different it gives more flavor worse with the flavor is also helping people kick the tobacco get them off the top and get them onto the flavored juice that has nicotine you start to go to a higher level get you all the way down to like a three milligram gets you down to a zero ground zero room which means you're there for the flavor you have zero milligrams you run that a little bit out and you're working more effectively when the patches work more effectively than you know well thank you very much sorry you got the short script that blinking light means we're due on the senate floor so um thank you for coming up come back anytime and when you go can i get your their names you'll be on record if that's okay yeah thank you thank you very much

caught on page nine and it just basically moves that right now it reads an owner of a store license to sell or permitted to sell tobacco products and what it should read and what this actually does is

billy will report house bill 3212 out as a due pass thank you ma'am i believe i saw representative ownby come in okay back to e-cigs you are recognized to present house bill 2904 i believe you have a committee sub that's correct okay borrowing any objections we will accept that as our working draft uh you are recognized to present your bill thank you madam chairman uh house bill 2904 really does three basic things it bans teen access it defines e-cigarettes as a tobacco product and it has no implications on the tax issues we keep the taxes as is for cities for municipalities and counties be glad to answer any questions do we have any questions for representative ownby richard uh far sorry not richard representative morissette you're recognized for a question representative owen b i probably shouldn't do it but i'm gonna do it anyway um we just you weren't here we just passed out representative jackson's bill right we have your bill why don't you enlighten us on the differences and why your bill i presume you presume is a better vehicle than his bill gosh i'm glad you said that representative moore said i appreciate that no i first of all i think it would be great if we had both bills heard on the house floor i appreciate the opportunity from representative osborne to uh to hear this bill my bill basically i think that the key difference in my bill and i haven't read all of his bill is that we define e-cigarettes as a tobacco product and i believe that's very important as does the state health department american cancer society american heart association american lung association um that i'm assured that he has where other differences represent more said i haven't read his bill so i can't tell you but this this basically deals with teen access and the fact that we do label e-cigarettes as a tobacco product i i follow up i'm sure we're going to have a lot of discussion before the floor on e-cigarettes why is it defined as and his dozen i believe his sure why is yours defining a vapor as a tobacco product well the first of all the fda has ruled e-cigarettes already and vapor products will be regulated as a as tobacco products that's that's the first thing tobacco products and federal law defined in part as any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption and this these products are already defined in federal law as tobacco products thank you do we have any further questions for representative ownby the chair would entertain a motion do we have a second do we have any debate seen them will vote call the vote sorry do not call the vote it doesn't matter either way i guess you can call it it doesn't clean it up will report your bill out as a due pass thank you madam chairman thank you committee members i believe i saw representative treblecock here you are recognized to present house bill 2366 do we have a sub on this bill we do okay borrowing any barring any objections we will accept that as the working draft so moved you are recognized to present your bill thank you madam chairman members house bill 2366 deals with what are called strategic lawsuits against public participation basically it's an effort to protect members of the public speech by allowing expedited process to the judicial system when there is a lawsuit filed due to citizens exercising their free speech and allows a judicial determination that the the lawsuit is not a legitimate one and it stays discovery in order to protect citizens first amendment rights do we have any questions for representative troublecock it's okay representative sheary are recognized for a question thank you thank you chairman representative what is an example of of one of these lawsuits i know you generally described but what types of speech do we see for example some some examples could be if a bank was wanting to move into a neighborhood and a neighborhood association was protesting they might sue um oklahoma does a fairly good job of protecting under defamation but not under other tortious causes of action such as interference of contract and other they're just not listed although the courts sometimes do try to expansively define our case but they don't have the mechanism in place in order to have an expedited process and a stay of discovery so these lawsuits are not intended to win they're intended to intimidate and to keep people from exercising their their speech follow up so would this legislation prevent a lawsuit uh by a citizen or group of citizens against the west borough baptist church for uh picketing and and those types of uh their types of activities at certain funerals no it'd be the opposite i would say it would be no that would not come into play representative williams you're recognized for a question thank you madam chair i read this last week and i guess the main problem i had was what you mentioned earlier the staying of discovery um what utility is there in in staying discovery most of the pleadings are based off discovery it seems like it would be hard to get to the meat and potatoes until discoveries exchange well exactly but the point is these lawsuits are generally not intended to be won they're intended to intimidate members of the public often by big corporations or other entities who don't like citizen groups coming forward and trying to speak their mind and so usually in these cases at the end justice is served but it's not really because the point again isn't to win it's to stop once if you're a small homeowners association for example or small group of citizens you may not have the resources to go through protracted discovery so you may say okay we give up we're not going to exercise our first amendment rights anymore so the point of sustaining discovery that's the costliest part of litigation as we all know although it's still allowed in certain circumstances for a good cause shown in the statute so representative styles you recognize for a question thank you madam chair i'm struggling to make it to the end of the of the bill um couldn't we does your bill allow for would you be willing to allow for attorney's fees to the prevailing party in cases i mean if these are cases like this would be it allows for sanctions if the judge if if the uh if a court decides that this in fact was a slap lawsuits which are called strategic clauses against public participation it allows for them for sanctions or fines in an amount to deter uh entities from filing these lawsuits in the future most states do have a statute similar to this we do not this one is modeled after the one in texas by the way thank you ma'am chair i i think i'm for this i'm pretty sure do you have a particular lawsuit i can look at that you can share with me it doesn't have to be public if you don't want to give that i can look at and say oh yeah you're right this is terrible i don't have a particular lawsuit i have a law review article you can read representative morissette you're recognized for

tally on house bill 1081 reveals 46 senators voting yeah one senator absent and not voting the bill is passed senator klein i'll mr president may we be on the eighth order without objection the senate will be on the eighth order senator klein mr president i move that house bill 1186 be placed on the top of the 14th order for second reading and final passage questions on the motion of senator klein as many as are in favor please say aye any opposed say nay the motion carries therefore eight house bill 1186 we place at the top of the 14th order where we will now go to the top of the 14th order house bill 1186 madam secretary engrossed house bill 1186 a bill for an act to create and enact section 12 of the north dakota century code relating to child resistant packaging for liquid nicotine containers to amend and reenact section 12 27 and 51 of the north dakota century code relating to the sale to minors in use by miners of electronic smoking devices or alternative nicotine products to provide a penalty and to provide an expiration date senator grahamer mr president house bill 1186 is the e-cig bill that your committee decided to support a sister bill 1078 that we'll take up shortly as the committee felt did not go far enough in the effort to keep these these from the younger citizens of our state your committee heard a lot of testimony and efforts to amend this legislation but couldn't decide on any changes that would make the bill any better your committee decided rather than try to fix the bill that really was getting these products out of the reach of the young we should support the present bill this bill will put requirements on electronic smoking products and alternative nicotine products it makes it against the law to have them in an open display accessible to the public and defines these products in code one other very important part of this bill is the requirement to have child resistant packaging your committee heard testimony how small quantities of this liquid nicotine can actually be fatal we heard of the passing of a small child out east from just that it also puts in the code the penalty for violating this section finally this bill sets parameters on the sale of these products through the mail or any other telecommunications method your committee voted unanimously to support this bill as presented to us and would ask this body to vote green with us senator oban mr president when it comes to agriculture issues in the senate i i rely on the expertise of our egg producers here uh when it comes to legal issues i sometimes rely on the expertise of our attorneys when it comes to tribal issues i rely on our tribal member when it comes to the excellence of magic town i often turn to my good friend from district five but when it comes to tobacco prevention issues i sort of end up talking to myself and that's okay this bill didn't start as the best bill to address new and emerging tobacco products but it certainly made some improvements especially with regard to youth prevention if you have not seen the editorial in today's largest daily paper it does a pretty decent job outlining what our goal should be as a legislature with regard to products like electronic cigarettes my concerns with this bill are our two issues number one it's the fact that the tobacco industry moves far more quickly and creatively than we do in our ability to meet only every two years for 80 days and the second is that we're using phrases like alternative nicotine products and creating multiple definitions in code for products that are indeed tobacco products and should be treated as such under the law creating multiple definitions makes enforcement and compliance more difficult and protection for minors less effective in addition uh currently we have no idea who's even selling products like electronic cigarettes and unfortunately this bill doesn't help us to address that concern either however sometimes the good outweighs the flaws and that's precisely how i view this bill it's not the best we could do but it's possibly the best we could do right now given the process i would encourage a green vote as somebody who cares deeply about tobacco prevention on house bill 1186 and your understanding that we may need to make some improvements in the future further discussion hearing none the questions on the final passage of house bill 1186 would the secretary please open the key each senator record your vote all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary will close the key the final tally on

an act to amend and reenact section 12 27 and 51 of the north dakota century code relating to the sale and use of nicotine devices by minors and to provide a penalty senator grabinger mr president i rise to carry house bill 1078 to this body house bill 1078 is an e-cig bill that had very good intentions the sponsors of this bill intended to keep nicotine devices out of the hands of our young the bill would have simply included nicotine devices in code your judiciary committee heard testimony from several of the young people who this could affect they were supportive of the effort to further restrict the availability of nicotine devices to them one young person even had pictures in her testimony showing displays of these products in a convenience store right on the counter in front of the customers your committee also heard another sister bill which we just passed 1186. that in the opinion of the committee is far more restrictive and deemed by your committee to be a better bill which we just passed i said therefore we mr president your judiciary committee voted unanimously for a do not pass on this bill and would ask this body to put this bill aside with a do not pass as well any

calls for a legislative management study on the benefits of a statewide emergency information program on the current 911 and emergency services communication systems in our state testimony presented to the senate transportation committee indicated that an emergency information program is a software platform that would enhance what is currently available and in place in the 911 system it would allow for nine one one call takers and first responders to have instant access to additional pertinent information from the caller on such things as disabilities home layout family size allergies and so forth this information program would rely on the residents to input any and all information they desire to have their profile all information submitted stays confidential and only appears when that person makes a call the study also calls for a review of the gaps in the efficiency and services provided by the current system school safety concerns and the unique and the unique challenges of the

district senator lafeen mr president the garrison uh garrison diversion conservancy district has the ability to special assess farmers for irrigation projects it works very well because they have to have a 100 percent approval of everybody in the district before the project can go forward house bill 1352 is very simple it just takes the sunsets off of that so that the garrison diversion conservancy district can plan farther ahead and be assured that they will be able to continue to use special assessments that's the bill passed 7-0 in our committee i ask that you do the same further

f3Js1cRzRnA,03-13-2013,2293,ND,convention were called for a particular issue and then at the same convention the delegates went way beyond their scope and passed something that has nothing to do with the reason the convention was called in the first place a little history if you will your judiciary committee was informed that there has not been a constitutional convention in over 200 years it requires 34 states to ask for a convention and 38 states to ratify any such amendment from a convention so hypothetically if a convention were called for a legitimate reason and at the convention the delegates from the states hypothetically decided to pass a rogue amendment of which they the delegates would be hypothetically overstepping their authority we would not act on this if the resolution were adopted today after hearing the testimony from the sponsor and an individual from out east your judiciary committee decided to leave the hypotheticals where they lie and voted five to two for a do not pass and forward this on to the voters we would ask this chamber to concur and push your red buttons further discussion hearing none will proceed by way of recorded roll call vote the question being the final adoption of house concurrent resolution 3039 with the secretary please open the key all senators all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house concurrent resolution 3039 reveals there are four senators voting yay 41 senators voting made two senators absent not voting the resolution is defeated house concurrent resolution 30 33 mr secretary house concurrent resolution number 3033 a concurrent resolution directing the legislative management to study opportunities to reduce the risk of death and disease among smokers who will not quit smoking by considering tobacco harm reduction strategies that encourage smokers to switch from cigarettes to less risky tobacco products and by accurately informing the public of the health risks posed by smokeless tobacco products vapor products and tobacco derived products relative to cigarettes senator debra mr president house concurrent resolution 3033 is a study resolution sometimes we forget the rules between sessions and somehow this session i've been had to explain to four different legislators the difference between a study and a resolution and a study in a bill three of them were more senior than i am so it was interesting if it says in a study or in a resolution shall study or shall consider study doesn't matter it's an optional study if it says shall study in a bill it's a mandatory study we don't do that very often if it says shall consider studying in a bill then it's an optional study so what we have before us is an optional study to ask the legislative management to consider whether or not there is a benefit to the use of alternative methods not currently being used for nicotine replacement for the purpose of reducing smoking one of the newer products on the market is called an e-cigarette an e-cigarette looks like a cigarette or can look like a cigarette has a little uh piece on the end that when you suck on it will light up like a cigarette has a battery in it you inhale the contents of it what you receive when you inhale that is nicotine when you exhale you exhale water vapor the greatest danger in smoking cigarettes is not from the nicotine it's from the smoke so lung cancer and other diseases that are a problem with smoking are not a problem with e-cigarettes some people think that we should not consider anything that's not fda approved no way know how that what methods were considering in our state as part of tobacco cessation efforts should be the only method so the greatest argument uh in opposition to this resolution was that it's not fda approved well the fda just started regulating cigarettes in march of 2012 so one of the problems with this is that tobacco companies haven't submitted it to the fda for approval so it's not approved it's not disapproved they haven't taken a position on that it's my feeling that whether it's approved or not smoking an e-cigarette is a great benefit to those people who would very dearly love to quit smoking but struggle with that and we've heard some people i received an email earlier that said i haven't smoked a cigarette in some time i'm healthier my doctor's happy and i smell better and i think that's good for all of us as part of the initiated measure that was on the ballot in november e-cigarettes were included as not being approved to be smoked in a in a public building but they really don't provide any uh any problem as far as secondhand smoke so mr president one legitimate concern might be that and we heard from from some high schoolers that um if we study this that we will somehow validate the use of e-cigarettes and they talked about their classmates who go across the street from the high school and in the convenience store and they they purchase e-cigarettes and and they smoke those and and that's not a good thing and i don't disagree with that i i don't know that it's necessarily a gateway to smoking but i'm not sure how the legislature studying this one way or another is going to entice young people to go across the street and buy that you know i'd like to think that they pay attention to what we're doing but i'm not sure that that they do e-cigarettes each one costs about nine or ten dollars and each one lasts about as long as two packs of cigarettes would last with a lot less of a problem mr president earlier in this session we passed a bill that provided for the establishment of a methadone clinic not by the state but by by private interests methadone i attended a conference a few years ago out on the west coast and as part of that we visited a methadone clinic methadone is used as an alternative to heroin heroin and it was interesting to me that one of the people that spoke to us had been attending that methadone clinic every day taking his pill as an alternative to heroin for 30 years and because of that was able to live now a normal life otherwise so mr president there's there can be some benefits to this there might be some downside but i think it's appropriate for the legislature to at least consider studying it and that's what we're asking the body to approve senator heckerman mr president i request a recorded roll call vote on hcr 3033 senator heckman has requested a recorded roll call vote on what otherwise would be a voice vote other eight senators willing to stand in support of senator heckman's request very well we'll proceed by way of recorded roll call vote further discussion on final passage of house concurrent resolution 3033 senator andrist well mr president uh uh i just deserted my libertarian streak here for a few minutes if i may uh the jury has returned on smoking and the news is bad for those that like to smoke smoking is a scourge tobacco's a scourge and nicotine is a scourge in our world it destroys people's health and i think to keep searching for a way to make it safer is a futile effort the best advice i ever heard when i was a much younger state senator was pick your battles uh i picked i've i picked this one as one that we shouldn't fight and i think we need to we need to find a way to white tobacco out of the lives of every american and i think the time will come and we're just forestalling it when we pretend otherwise senator triplett mr president i would um second the remarks um of my good friend from the northwest who just spoke and i would like to add just another concern about the process of of studies that are requested so frequently in our on in this legislature for things that are technical like this process it seems to me that if we don't put a substantial amount of money toward the study so that we can hire consultants who actually have the expertise that we would need to advise an interim committee to be able to make a good decision then all we're doing by approving a study of this sort is offering up a bully pulpit for activists and people who have a particular agenda and we are allowing ourselves to be used um by by particular groups who want some particular result and i i just think that we should be a little more serious and not not take these studies so lightly and and either either fund them so that we can hire professional consultants to advise us or not study them because i think we in this body well collectively we know a lot of things about a lot of things we certainly none of us are experts in in all of these different topics so i would urge a no vote further discussion hearing none the question senator poolman mr president i also have to agree with the senator from district 2 and my students specifically asked me to stand up and speak on this today and we have a lot of students here in the room who are learning through our discussion today that e-cigarettes are okay and that they're a safer alternative and i don't deny that it is absolutely a better alternative to regular tobacco but i'm not sure how we're going to send that message to adults without sending the same message to our kids and so for my students who specifically asked me to speak today i just wanted to throw that out there further discussion senator o'connell would you like to add something looks like there's a little too much smoke or on the other side there mr president i think this is just one more uh tool that we can put in the toolbox a lot of people have tried quit smoking we've all seen the person in the wheelchair with oxygen tank on behind and if we can find out some way to help them get rid of that smoking hab get rid of the cigarettes and some of us got confused on smokeless tobacco the study would also have to tell the general public that this isn't a good source either but i think this is just one tool to help the people who are having trouble trying to quit and maybe make life a little easier for for them and to make their around them a lot better too thanks senator dever mr president i think the students come to see their teacher and i don't know if she got the the vote of the senator from district 45 when she hit him over the head with the microphone that might be one way of doing it mr president i'd just like to point out that that you know with an e-cigarette what we're talking about is providing nicotine to a smoker and that's what they're addicted to they're addicted to the nicotine not the smoke just about everything that we do use for smoking cessation is a nicotine replacement whether it's a gum or a lozenge or a patch that's what their purpose is one of the things that people don't like about this is they're made by tobacco companies instead of drug companies well that's why the fda hasn't weighed in on it but mr president uh i've heard too from people that have had concerns one person spoke to me before the the session about their son who's schizophrenic and smokes continually and how much better and optioned this would be for him than that and mr president i think there's benefits here that that some of us may not realize that we could realize from a study and i'm not sure that it's necessary for us to to hire consultants and by the way if we if we funded it that would be in a bill this is a resolution so mr president uh studies are out there we could pull them together and have conversation during the interim further discussion hearing none we will proceed by way of recorded roll call vote the question being the final adoption of house concurrent resolution 30 33 would the secretary please open the key all senators have voted any senator wishing to change their vote secretary closed the key final tally on house concurrent resolution is house concurrent resolution 33 is seven senators voting yay 38 senators voting nay two senators absent and not voting the resolution is defeated next matter how's concurrent resolution 3003 mr secretary house concurrent resolution number 3003 has a fiscal note a concurrent resolution to amend and reenact section 24 of article 10 of the constitution of north dakota relating to allocation of revenue from the oil extract taxes the fiscal note for the o thirteen fifteen by in any revenues general funds it's a deficit of sixteen thousand five hundred under other funds it's a positive amount of sixteen thousand five hundred for the fifteen seventeen biennium under general fund revenues a deficit of two hundred and eighty three thousand under other funds is a positive amount of 283 000 senator nelson mr president couple things today you've seen a number of bills out of judiciary they weren't all 7-0 there were a lot of four threes five twos and a whole lot of discussion however this one does come out seven zero do not pass and part of the reason is that we have house bill 1452 and they're in that there is a study that study deals with the pension plans for public employees what would be the pros and the cons of switching from a defined benefit to a defined contribution that study has not been done but yet this particular resolution which is another thing on the general election ballot and now i think we're at about three pages for that says we're going to amend the constitution to make yet another change in what we do with our oil extraction tax back in 1987 the voters voted that 20 percent of the the revenue from the oil extraction tax would go into a fund to help the common schools trust fund then in 1994 they decided well no they weren't going to put all of that 50 percent into that fund they were going to put excuse me that all of that 20 percent into that that fund they were going to split half and half so now 10 is going to common schools trust fund and 10 is going to a new fund call this the foundation aid stabilization fund now this particular bill is recommending that of that part that's going to the stabilization fund that we take uh 30 and put it into a pension stabilization fund and keep the other 20 in the foundation aid stabilization fund now we had the people from pers come and give us what would happen with the main system keep in mind that there's more pension funds in state pension funds than just the main system there's the teachers fund there's the highway patrol there's the judges there's the national guard there we have a whole lot of political subdivisions which i don't believe would have been included here but this all we got was for the main system and if this plan were used basically we would start putting money away this session or after after the voters voted for it and we would let it sit there until 2046 when the first plan ran out of money and then we would use it now one of the problems that came out was if we do that we're going to have an unfunded
Har6PV9o6lI,03-13-2013,2293,ND,and a zero absent not voting house bill 1120 is declared passed i've been informed that there are two additional schools students from two additional schools here today that weren't mentioned earlier there are students from munich and starkweather here where they stand to be recognized the house will continue on the 11th order of business house has before house concurrent resolution 3033 which has been read mr chief clerk mr speaker house concurrent resolution 3033 introduced by representatives thorson and other house and senate sponsors house concurrent resolution 3033 is a concurrent resolution directing the legislative management to study opportunities to reduce the risk of death and disease among smokers who will not quit smoking by considering tobacco harm reduction strategies that encourage smokers to switch from cigarettes to less risky tobacco products and by accurately informing the public of the health risk posed by smokeless tobacco products vapor products and tobacco derived products relative to cigarettes mr speaker the human services committee recommends a do not pass on concurrent resolution 3033 by vote of 12 years 1 a 0 absent and 0 not voting mr speaker representative mooney mr speaker and members of the house your committee on human house human services recommends a do not pass on house concurrent resolution 3033. this resolution asks for legislative management to study smokeless tobacco products vapor e-cigarettes and other tobacco-derived products as alternatives to cigarette smoking the premise being that chew tobacco and vapor products are safer than the inhaled cigarette smoke and that for people unable or unwilling to quit smoking these products would be a better behavior with fewer risks an individual flew in from kentucky to provide testimony in favor of the resolution he spoke of the benefits of swedish snooze the less favorable benefits of the american chews we call snuff and then the the new vapor and tobacco derivative alternative products currently on the market in discussion it was learned that while swedish snooze was used as an example of a tobacco product that safely provides the nicotine hit a nicotine addict requires this product is not available for sale in the united states american snuff while arguably safer than cigarette smoke is not without its health dangers and the new products are still unproven in health risks discussion turned to other points such as what is the actual likelihood of a north dakota sanctioned study or approach to alternative tobacco products having any real impact when you consider that these products plus a whole host of other counter nicotine products and phys and physicians prescribed products are available right now additionally in state sanctioned action to encourage these alternative products and behaviors in the event of early addiction by a teen are we not possibly encouraging an addiction that would very likely lead to cigarette smoking itself worse yet would we not be opening north dakota up to a host of potential liability issues in the case of any of these products ultimately proving to have higher health risks than originally thought and if i may mister speaker i just have to relate to everyone here that once upon a time i was a cigarette smoker i smoked for 15 years i really liked my cigarettes and i can tell you chewing anything was not an alternative it took all my free will and a couple of additional prescribed medicines from doctors to help me actually quit but to be sure it wasn't because there was a lack of product out there it was simply i needed to decide that and so when i look at something like this i just think that uh what we're doing is we're asking for trouble where there is already trouble and we should probably just stay out of it mr speaker members of the assembly with a 13-0 vote your human service committee votes for a do not pass and urges your support with a red vote on house concurrent resolution 3033 thank you is there any discussion representative schatz mr speaker will the bill carrier yield to question representative mooney would you yield to a question yes mr speaker representative schatz representative moody uh how much does the tobacco prevention and cessation advisory spend board spend on advertising against tobacco products mr speaker and representative i don't know the answer to that question as far as how many dollars are actually spent on advertising i know that advertising goes into the schools and and is by and large very widely publicly known perhaps mr chairman gva chairman might know that answer um well i guess if you don't know i guess that's the answer to my question yes and i guess what i i'm reading this bill and i'm looking at it and i'm seeing that this is an alternative to smoking and uh it's a lot cheaper than advertising so i think this bill's got some merit is there any further discussion representative thorson thank you mr speaker and members of the assembly i guess the reason i put this resolution in was to have a conversation about finding other alternatives to smoking we all know that smoking is certainly not good for anyone but there are those people out there who have the nicotine addiction and from the information that i've gathered this may be one way of looking at getting rid of the carcinogens and the other health risks while still helping those people get off the cigarette product i would think that we would want to study all options of doing so you know if people are having health problems from smoking looking at ways of getting them from using that product onto something else and that's why i brought this bill forward i think as we go forward we're going to see a lot more new products coming on the market that we can start to use to break the habit of cigarettes and i think that it would be a wise move for us to study this to come back with answers and not maybe come to conclusions beforehand so again that is why i offered this resolution i would like to see green votes on this i think we can go forward take a look at this during the interim come back and if it truly is harmful by doing this policy and it would encourage smoking then we have in place the knowledge to know that we shouldn't be going forward with this but i would ask the assembly to move this resolution forward thank you mr speaker is there any further discussion seeing not seeing none the house has before it for final consideration house concurrent resolution 30-33 the clerk will open the key and you may record your vote as every member voted does any member wish to change their vote the key will be closed and the clerk will take the record the final vote shows

rhian gross and amended senate bill 2259 introduced by senator triplett and other house and senate sponsors reengrossed and amended senate bill 2259 is the bill for an act to create and enact a new subsection of section 55-08-0 1.3 of the north dakota century code relating to historic preservation at state parks mr speaker your political subdivisions committee recommends amendments which are passed on the previous sixth order when so amended and engrossed recommends do pass on in gross senate bill 2259 by vote of 15 years zero and as there are abstinence zero not voting mr speaker representative meyer thank you mr speaker and members of the assembly senate bill 2259 as amended is a very very simple bill it very simply states that prehistoric archaeology archaeological and paleontological values must be preserved if a state park contains a designated historical site the park that this primarily relates to is fort lincoln state park your political subs committee voted a unanimous due pass and we asked the assembly to concur thank you is there any discussion seeing none the house has before final consideration senate bill 2259 the clerk will open the key and you may record your vote has every member voted representative hake does it representative scarpo does any member wish to change their vote the key will be closed the clerk will take the record final vote 72

bill 2033 introduced by the legislative management at the request of the information technology committee senate bill 2033 is a bill for knack demand and reenact section 54-35-15.2 on subsection 8 of section 54-59-05 and section 54-59-23 of the north dakota century code relating to the definition of a large information technology project mr speaker your appropriations committee recommends due bass on senate bill 2033 i voted 21 years zero nays and one absent and zero not voting mr speaker representative striley thank you mr speaker mr speaker members assembly this bill is pretty straightforward it changes the definition of a major i.t project from 250 000 to 500 000. a couple reasons for the change and this was discussed thoroughly during the interim as well in the i.t committee uh currently right now there's only two projects under a half a million dollars so there's very few projects anymore that fall below that uh hence was the reason for the change under the current uh 2013 excuse me the next 2013-2015 biennium there's only three projects that would fall below this so your appropriations committee along with the interim i.t committee who moved this forward felt that it was appropriate change being the cost of everything has gone up and there's very few of these projects actually fall below that and furthermore the uh staffing requirements if if itd was to have to over see oversight on every project would be burdensome as well so with that your appropriations committee recommends do pass with a 21-0 vote is there any discussion seeing none the house has before for final consideration senate bill 2033 the clerk will open the key and you may record your vote as every member voted does any member wish to change the vote key will be closed and the clerk will take

mN-BIQtRaA8,03-20-2012,1935,MD,they're also made to look like cigars pipes and pens they can be purchased online in malls and at convenience stores in maryland there is no age restriction on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors nicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to break and smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death in the united states e-cigarettes are not a safe smoking alternative but rather their cleverly disguised gadgets that lead to the same dangerous health hazards and life-long addiction of of traditional cigarettes with urgency i request the committee's favorable report on house bill 1272 to prohibit the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes to minors i'll be happy to take any questions you may have very good any questions for the sponsor of the bill okay where to begin delegate collison thank you mr chair a real question um this actually delivers nicotine that's right so um so the addictive factors of cigarettes are present in the electronic cigarette absolutely and in some cases delta coulson the amount of nicotine that's actually delivered is like 10 times more than of a regular cigarette thank you are there additional questions delegate frank then delegate ready how does the smoke come out of the cigarette that was actual smoke that came out or what is that that's a great question delegate it's actually vapor and when you do this they call it vaping so you suck in and this odorless vapor comes out that's how it works and when you suck in you actually get a dose of nicotine right okay exactly thank you mr chairman so this all right i'm sorry i walked in late but is this already is not illegal it's not illegal for miners to purchase these now that's correct miners can purchase these and these can be smoked in any um you know office space or any buildings right now okay i just saw somebody on saturday with one so i'm not a miner but yeah an older gentleman but anyway okay thank you are there any additional questions thank you very much thank you concludes the bill hearing on house bill 1272 see delegate james should come going down we have uh delegate james medicaid sustainability commission house bill 1341. mr chairman i know it's sponsor only but could i bring people in case there are questions that's fine i would appreciate that so i'll be doing joined by valerie overton and denise patriciani for answering questions and the likes so house bill 1341 which is cross-filed as senate bill 953 creates a medicaid sustainability commission consisting of of key stakeholders needed to analyze and make recommendations about the future of maryland's medicaid program the commission is to issue an initial report on its findings and recommendations to the governor and the legislature by december 15th with the final report due june 30th 2013. you'll recall that last year we included language in the budget asking the department of health and mental hygiene to convene a work group of experts to address medicaid cost containment and revenue actions and report back to us with recommendations because we knew the hospital's medicaid deficit assessment and other actions were causing pressure on maryland's medicaid waiver the work prescribed in the budget language was assigned to the medicaid advisory committee while that committee does a very excellent job in terms of oversight of the health choice program adding evaluation of a long-term sustainability of the entire medicaid program and evaluation of medicaid expenditures is a lot to put on anyone's plate the report was received recognized that the use of the medicaid deficit assessment isn't sustainable in the long term and that the governor and general assembly should address these issues on an annual basis through the budget process i do not believe annual programmatic cuts and continued deficit assessments are a long-term solution however i also understand it's been suggested that medicaid sustainability is not a medicaid issue but a waiver issue i would argue in the opposite the medicaid deficit assessment has hastened the erosion of our waiver cushion by three percent in fact we learned two weeks ago that the waiver cushion is below one percent not solely but in some large measure due to the medicaid deficit assessments last year the health services cost review commission estimated that maryland would fail the waiver test as early as 2013 which would result in a potentially potentially a loss of 1.6 billion dollars in federal payments now i know there's a lot of negotiations going on i know the state is going as early as april to talk to the at the federal level about a revision to our waiver uh our waiver test quite frankly i think everyone agrees that it is not modern enough and does not capture all the good work we're doing at the state level in terms of cost containment particularly with hospitals but with that said um these tax caps as you know there's a proposal uh before the president right now that's looking at capping these uh these assessments at around four and a half percent in 2015 and going down to three and a half percent by 2017. if you look at our assessments at this point um we're at already 5.6 percent so we start out already ahead of what's before the the president in in the proposal imagine if something like that were passed on what that would do immediately to the state's budget now we have nearly a million people on the medicaid rolls in two more years we're going to have another 240 000 people will be added that's a lot of growth we need to come to terms now and figure out how to sustain this program into the future we've relied on the help that came in the form of federal aid during the recession but that up money is obviously gone and i do not see those kinds of funds coming again from the federal government at this point we have a bit of a patchwork approach but i know maryland i know the way we work and i know that we are in a position to think in in the future in a strategic long-term way and this bill is a start toward that process thank you very much mr chairman and members of the committee for your attention mh do you have any comment on those honestly uh dhmh did not provide me with copies of those amendments and i know the bill's been around for a long time so i'm surprised that no one came by to show them to me it essentially replaces the commission uh with a required report on issues relating to the sustainability of the medicare waiver test that's okay i'll follow up with you okay okay are there any questions for the sponsor of the bill very good thank you very much very much chairman concludes the bill hearing on house bill 1341 we will now turn to delegate walker in house bill 1407. house bill 1407 is entitled dhmh work group on cancer clusters and environmental causes of cancer
-vvEplyvNlI,04-01-2015,3041,IN,come in small packages to where you can actually get large gallons of nicotine sold on the internet thank you other questions representative brown for representative brown thank you mr chairman um representative brown do you think you and senator miller miller would be amenable to amending this bill to say that if the riverboats go on land they would have to go smoke free i haven't talked to senator miller about that specific issue i know you have brought it back up to me a couple different times but it is an interesting public policy discussion absolutely so what is your position on that um i had we had the smoke free bill in the public health committee and it was originally drafted that the riverboats and racinos were to be included and i took them out because of the fiscal note implication i think the the fiscal note implication is that it would decrease the revenues from those entities still even though i know illinois has their ban so i'm willing to do that if personally i abhor smoking and we need to control smoking i guess i'm concerned that our revenues in our state are under some stress and pressure but has there been any studies to show that it would be balanced out by the health diminishing of health issues as a result of no smoking excellent point i mean i think the studies are out there definitely on less absenteeism less use of health insurance lower costs to cover health to insure a non-smoker versus a smoker those are dynamic issues and our lsa does not do dynamic scoring as you know and so that has not been calculated into and you did not anticipate this question for me this morning not this one i thought you would ask me about another topic that's kind of circulating around related to this bill why don't you deal with it then thank you representative brown and representative brown you know what i've learned that it's never a a never a good thing when you start out a statement i respect both of you very much but i'm going to say i respect you both very much but uh putting the gaming facilities on land um and making them go non-smoking i think would be a good debate in battle but one i couldn't support um and probably needs to be debated on it on it by itself as opposed to the important issue in this bill i agree thank you um other questions representative brown i know you have to go but thank you and we'll kind of while i have a little bit of time i appreciate it okay um i'd like to hear from some of the vape people first if that's okay and then we'll kind of save the attorney general as well brad kloppenstein vaping community welcome good to see you brad thank you mr kloppenstein one question i mean is this something that is different than the vape bill that there were concerns about uh because i thought there were some concerns in that bill about from the packaging perspective the concerns in the other bill on packaging largely concern the clean room right now as that bill stands thank you any other questions thank you sir sean anderson craven vapes thank you chairman germany is your blue mic on by chance if we could leave that on thank you any questions thank you sir [Music] john mccullough vapor bank thank you chairman members of the committee my name is john mccullough i'm vapor bank in evansville indiana i also own seven liquor stores in evansville indiana also so i'm not a stranger to government regulations in my industry i believe that carefully crafted regulations can protect the consumer while also furthering my industry so i do support the use of child proof caps and i have been using them for over three years i also support the use of tobacco sales certificate i've had those for all three of my retail locations since we opened thank you for hearing my testimony thank you any questions thank you sir and again don't feel the need to repeat uh any of these other people we understand the vape communities in support of it sandy brown and please say your name and where you're from and who you represent okay my name is sandy brown i'm from evansville indiana i own cool breeze vapor we have six stores we have been using the child resistant caps for over two years now so we do support this bill thank you questions thank you sandy then brian mcmahon is it brian i'm sorry uh good morning it's evan mcmahon sorry you must be left-handed my mom said i should have been a doctor with my handwriting um my name is evan mcmahon i'm the owner of liberation vape i'm also the spokesperson for the hoosier vapors council uh the one of the largest advocacy groups for vaping consumers and business owners in the industry we support this bill and i know we've repeated this a couple of times but i'd like to state that the reason why we're supportive of this bill is because these are sensible regulations child proof caps not selling to minors having a certificate from the atc all of these things are very reasonable they're all things that we've all been pushing for the past couple of years to be done adopted anyway you representative germany chairman germany you asked what differences there were with packaging specifically with packaging that we had issues with on the other side most of that actually was on the labeling there were some labeling issues an encryption code that had to be added things like that but as far as the the cap um you know having the tobacco certificate things like that we are 100 in favor of that and encouraging all of our our vape stores that we're in contact with to do that thank you evan any questions amber logdon office of the attorney general hi my name is amber logsdon i do tobacco enforcement for the ag's office this might be the shortest hearing that's happened with regards to the e-cigs but i just want to make myself available for any questions both either on the e-cig piece you know in relation to the other bill or on the msa enforcement pieces so unless no one has questions representative layman thank you mr chairman um sorry i'm fighting a cold here uh two two questions i have one is can you give me an example of where an e-cigarette would be sold today that's not under the tobacco or the the retail licensing um the tobacco sales certificate right now only applies to locations that are selling tobacco products so you know convenience stores um as it stands now if a vape store does not sell any other tobacco products they're not required to obtain a tobacco sales certificate okay i'm just what i'm looking at says that you you cannot sell e-cigarettes unless you have a valid tobacco sales certificate is that correct and that's what this is now that's what we're trying to do yes so my question was where are they being are there somewhere they're being sold now that does not require them to have it yes the vape shops that don't sell any other tobacco okay so they're selling vape and e-cigarettes if i think there's a terminology issue that we run into this that's what i'm after i think there's a we're starting to blur some lines there is an existing definition of electronic cigarette that i think covers the various types that the other bill is you know trying to differentiate a little more between the e-liquid and the you know electronic cigarette as they define it but right now anyone selling an electronics whether it's the e-liquid whether it's you know the vapor pins the ciga-like products if they're only selling those products and not a traditional cigarette or pipe or cigar they don't have they they could probably apply for one but generally they do not have a tobacco sales certificate okay and then one other question just because it was it's referenced in here and that is the master settlement agreement is is there and this doesn't do this filled necessarily but just said my own curiosity is is there an update on where that's continually at is there a report put out every year or i'm just curious where indiana is at on the amount of money that's still in that um well we're i know they put out updates on the money that comes in every april 15th that's something we're still getting information on as soon as we have those firm numbers you know i know our office usually submits something with updates on what those dollars are all right thank you i have one question it seems pretty straightforward but i noticed there were seven votes and i know you've been involved in this the whole way through any reason why the the reason he had seven nay votes on this are coming out of the senate what their reasoning is or if you don't mind sharing please come to the mic if don't both rush some in the senate do not want any regulation at all and so that's the few votes for those that are against any regulation and since there is some even the regulation that they suggest there were some on that that grounds partly so it was that okay thank you uh representative houston for questions um that is and i think that has alarmed some people that is currently already what we're doing is the way we count cigarettes in indiana for the ag's office is by units sold those sales on military installations are already excluded from both the sc this state excise tax and escrow collection when we joined the settlement last year we did broaden the group of cigarettes that we will need to enforce on but we're just maintaining that carve out for those sales so there's no change it's just made more explicit in that definition other questions thank you committee discussion or go ahead representative brown would you like to close because well no i i actually i i can answer representative layman's question if you go to the state board of accounts website under in.gov you can pull up the master tobacco settlement and you can look at how much money has come in and where it's distributed at this time and probably what you're wondering and there's been discussions in representative clare's committee about this over the last couple of years there was a year where the payments were substantially reduced because of non-compliance related to the arbitration hearing uh this summer there was a settlement reached so that those payments weren't restored to the levels prior but the payments were were markedly adjusted up from what the arbitration settlement was the example was for fy14 we only received 67 million as compared to receiving about 129 to 130 million but for 15 were estimated to get 124 million from the tobacco masters on my phone okay other representative layman doc how long is that settlement structured it's structured forever right now is it okay yeah any other questions uh representative brown while we have you on the mic are there any interesting amendments you might be considering thinking about that you and i have maybe talked about that'll stir the pot um there's there's starting to be a little bit more of a grassroots effort to look at cigarette excise tax i think out there the cancer society state medical association hospital association and different people are looking at that one of the things we know as a health care provider if we want indiana to be healthier you know we have to reduce our incidence percentage of cigarette smoking see this is i thought the question you were going to ask representative c brandt and we know that pregnant women especially since the initiative in the house by all house members look at infant mortality and pregnancy pregnant women and teenage smokers are most price sensitive and so you need to continue to look at excise taxes a mechanism to decrease smoking as well as to have smoking bans in place that public policy as well as to have cessation programs available for people to have a healthy healthy citizenry because when you look at states that are healthy and score very high in health indices they have very vigorous programs to make the incidence of smoking much much lower the controversial issue is is you know raising attacks and what that will mean what has happened it was last raised in 2007 representative c brown and myself were involved in a bill it uh related to the initiation of the hip program uh raising the cigarette tax is also much more favorably looked at if it goes to programs goes to cessation goes to mental health goes to addiction services but since 2007 you know as anything you know an eight year time period that increase has been now price desensitized because of the economy and everything else so i think that's why the coalition is looking at that to impact our incidence of smoking and how how does that well number one let me say i'm very interested from the mental health perspective the more money going there i think that's something that i'm interested in but from the second perspective do you know where we are compared to other states with our tax high lows in our surrounding states and we're still below and even uh at 50 cents or even a dollar we still would be below all except kentucky i mean i think it was important to talk about it because we have some strong non-tax increase individuals respectfully and you know to kind of begin thinking about that between now and next week representative houston wow next week okay thank you mr chairman uh chairman brown is uh what's more what's the research show us what's more um of a detriment the cost or the succession programs and actually there probably are some people here that might be more able to answer that question intelligently i mean i think the programs as far as the bands are probably the most most impactful in society and we've done that except for racinos and casinos in certain places if we did a total ban in every public building and some people would like to band you know at public lands i think i guess i don't agree with that approach but bands probably have the most public perception then it's the economics and the cessation is kind of the last part of the whole three-legged stool i'm not sure how we keep going back to bands but uh we're trying to focus on the tax representative lucas thank you mr chairman uh chairman brown if bans are the most effective did i hear you is that correct again i i don't know that in the percentage but i think in the public perception about what you're doing to decrease smoking bans have the most public awareness if pregnant women are one of the biggest problems instead of punishing everybody that smokes through attacks why don't we just make it illegal for pregnant women to smoke good good point i guess uh when i was back in my job of delivering babies i wish i could do that you know because every pregnant woman you know i looked them in the face and you know why are you smoking and do you understand what this does to your baby and you know one of the things they hear out in the public and this is all antidotal is smoking women have smaller babies and you know to a teenage person pregnant you know don't want to have a large baby so they smoke intentionally well i'm not saying smoke intentionally but it's a reason not to quit thank you representative lucas uh representative houston with another question mr chairman i'll steer away from the ban i wouldn't intend to go there anyway but if you if you increase the tax where would you use where would you place that money to not to accelerate the desired intent which you've noted uh you know i think that's a great discussion and i personally don't have any uh predetermination where it has to go and that's always the issue when there's quote a revenue source being looked at there are probably of 150 legislators maybe 350 different ideas where it could go and i certainly could give probably 5 or 10 right off the top of my head our present formula has about 50 going to the state general fund and then the rest divvied up into mental health and community health services and we also have a very small percent going to clean water and things like that i think one of the things chairman dermody would be most interested in is addiction services and i think as we look at what's happened to this state related to scott county you know an addiction being a a focal point of a transmission of a very serious problem in scott county i would say that would need to be on the forefront representative brown thank you mr chairman are our funds still being held up by that arbitration panel that said we didn't pursue the second-tier tobacco companies aggressively enough no again we that was back to the question on tobacco master settlement fund we had a much reduced payment for one year and then over this summer there was a second agreement made between the attorney general's office and the administration and the uh tobacco manufacturers and so we're we're back up we're not back up above where we were or at the level we were before but we are not reduced because that arbitration hearing but are they still auditing the various years there still is in the new agreement the the the enforcement issues we have to enforce those manufacturers who aren't part of the tobacco master settlement fund we have to do that for that i think we we don't have arbitration up until years 2015 or 2014 so the the tobacco manufacturers can start arbitrating going forward with kind of the new agreements in the settlement other questions thank you representative brown i think i'm going to open it up because i'm sure we have some people that would like to speak in this regards anybody like to raise their hand to come speak about this potential consideration i know there's somebody that wants to speak in regards to this i hate to call you out and please state your name and who you represent uh good morning my name is danielle patterson i'm with the american heart association and also with hoosiers for a healthier indiana with regards to the tax the tobacco tax and we do support raising the tax by one dollar what we find is that the tax is one of the most effective ways we can reduce tobacco use in the state people are as you mentioned price sensitive and when you raise the tax by a dollar that helps to change behaviors 25 is not enough because people will will absorb 25 cent in their budget but when you start to look at attack a dollar that's significant enough for people to start changing their behaviors regarding tobacco use and so uh who just for a healthier indiana will support that we also support that if the tax is raised and we do encourage it you're looking at a potential of 240 to 280 million dollars of new revenue coming into the state and we would like a significant share of those dollars to be spent on health programs um indiana has not made a significant investment in public health and this is an opportunity for us to do so and again that is something that hoosiers for a healthier indiana will support we also will support an increase in tobacco prevention and cessation funds at one point the tobacco prevention cessation program was funded at 32 million dollars it is now funded at 5 million dollars well we certainly understand we probably will never get back to the 32 million we certainly would like to see a significant increase in those dollars for cessation and tobacco prevention funds throughout the state and so yes we would be very supportive of increasing the tax thank you danielle any questions representative giaquinta thanks mr chairman where does i know the question i think was asked earlier but where where then does the dollar put us so the dollar will still put us below i mean the dollar will put us above national averages but we will still be low be below our midwest states except for kentucky as you know the governor of ohio already proposed a dollar tax increase for his session this current session um and if that passed that they will still be significantly higher than us we will uh still be below the surrounding states except for kentucky and what's kentucky you know like 60 representative houston thank you mr chairman so i i wasn't kind of prepared to talk about this interesting discussion um we have nothing but time oh good uh in honor i'm asking you as the right person on this but i am struggling a little bit philosophically i'm not a is that you know non-smoker not an advocate for smoking whatsoever but i am stuck on this so we're gonna take 240 280 million dollars in the private sector move it to the governmental sector and then believe that we're going to somehow disburse that so wisely that we're going to get the benefit of of discouraging people from smoking by raising the price and then take money out and bring more money to the government and then we're going to be so smart that we're going to develop these programs they're going to help more people quit smoking too right that's i mean it's largely the arguments being made so why is the public policy why would we raise a tax to bring more money into the government without taking more draconian actions like you know representative lucas said not allowing people to you know pregnant women to smoke or expanding smoking bans i guess i'm wondering why is this just the practical political implication that you're trying to move towards because i will admit i am i give pause to using an economic driver that empowers more government to be the the engine that diminishes anything that we decide that we consider to be a public health issue sure so the cdc has outlined a plan if you want to effectively reduce tobacco control you really should do three things and not just raise the tax although let's just start the tax because we find that it's the best way to reduce tobacco use again when the price raise of when the price of tobacco is increased people will start to you know change their behaviors we saw an increase in 2006 even when we raised the tobacco tax by uh 44 we saw an increase in the cessation quit line program with people deciding you know what it's time for me to start quitting so it's a public health implication that it helps to change the behavior now the second problem we should do is what representative brown said is you know pass a stronger smoke-free law right now we have a great one it's a good start i'm not saying we were totally happy about it but we need to go even a couple of steps further and cover bars and casinos and private clubs i know it's hard for people to swallow but it's the truth then the third thing that we need to do is to invest in robust tobacco prevention cessation programs the tax is not going to solve all the answers but it will help us to start to drive those numbers down when you look at the fact that less than 25 percent of indiana residents smoke you know you and i are not going to feel the burden of it because you know we don't smoke but this will help those people who do smoke help to pay for the costs that their pay for the health care costs that you and i are showing us shouldering the burden of right now we're paying 570 dollars per household to treat tobacco users in this state and that's unfair to the rest of uh indiana residents and i i wouldn't disagree with that at all matter of fact that's why i largely support the and we have pretty selfishly why i would support the uh i'm not interested in doing anything that would encourage smoking um i i guess i'm i'm gonna go back and and say this is the most regressive of taxes is it not well i think if we look at that 25 percent it's it's arguably uh made up of of folks in in the uh um closer to the to the poverty line is that not correct exactly but these are also people that are costing us the most money in terms of what we're paying for health care costs so i would agree with you on that point so shouldn't all the money go into that it would be potentially raised shouldn't all that money go in to reimbursing those of us non-smokers in helping to pay for their health care costs in terms of reducing medicaid costs or something that can be a potential for the dollars as you remember you were not here when we raised the tax back in 2006 like dr brown mentioned that part of the dollars did go to establish the healthy insurance plan and so we have no problems with the dollars going to the healthy indiana plan 2.0 because again people are paying for people that are costing us money are helping to pay those costs or shouldering the burden of those costs in the state for my clarification could you repeat what you said of what it cost every family in indiana and repeat that whole 570 dollars per household based on um oh so it's a calculation that we get from the campaign from for tobacco free kids as well as the american cancer society cancer action network and i don't know the exact formula but i could get that for you hold on bri do you have that related to medicaid related to correct it comes from the american cancer society she can answer that one okay but that related that number comes to what we provide related to medicaid for these individuals that have health related problems due to smoking yes okay representative brown thank you mr chairman and and representative houston i'm falling in love with you aye aye since we have so much time i'd like to hear more about that some some have thrown out suggestions that we not allow pregnant women to smoke i i'd like to know how in the world is that possible i mean do we put a gun to each one of them's head how do we stop pregnant women from smoking well i think that's the interesting point i don't know how you can do that but well go ahead and finish your i would say to representative brown's point while that's a great idea representative houston well that's a separate matter we could discuss that let's stay focused on the bill please but um it would be unfair just to um hold pregnant women accountable i mean because a lot of them live in households where you know maybe the spouse or their partner may also smoke or other family members so if you're gonna pass a law that says you know we want to uh you know find pregnant women guilty or you know something like that then you know just make it for the household because again she has a husband she may have a partner she may live in a household with other people that smoke that also impacts the baby but on the opposite side it would be very hard to unfortunately enforce that how will you afford something like that well i'm interested to just watch representative brown have to decide that of 10 women coming in and we could take a bet how many times he gets slapped uh for deciding who's pregnant and who's not so that might be interesting um representative lucas thank you mr chair i just threw that out there i mean if we're going to have this discussion we have to consider all options and it'll be a relatively easy fix you give them a nicotine test they come in they're pregnant if they're getting taxpayer dollars to pay for their health care you know we have to start protecting the taxpayer on this a little bit because that 560 dollars per household not every household is a net payer of taxes exactly you know that that's a great number to take out and you distribute amongst the large base but when you stop and look at it if you've only got half or less than half of those households are actually paying taxes that number doubles right per taxpayer right now if you've got pregnant women coming in knowing they're pregnant that take the conscientious decision to smoke okay and with all the information that's out there knowing that that is dangerous or they're risking their the lives of their or the health their baby okay you have to look at what cost that is to the people that are actually paying for these services so and you know it's not the health of the mother now we're dealing with with babies that are born prematurely or with greater health needs that are going to be an even greater financial cost to to those few that are paying taxes sure so i mean these are just things that we're discussing and this is part of the discussion that that as members of this committee we have an obligation to consider exactly and i'm not i'm not disappointed and i don't mean to be defensive but i mean yeah if we're going to talk about it let's let's get all of our cards out on the table exactly and actually look at the facts and you know i'm sure it's uncomfortable to have these discussions for some people but uh we're getting to the point of when we're talking hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars uh we have to talk about this thank you representative lucas and as a sidebar representative charlie brown not to put you on the spot but you're intrigued with this and that's an interesting concept that if we are supporting with medicaid dollars and these individuals are having health related issues to smoking and are receiving government support how do you feel i mean is that something that's of interest a nicotine test and i don't think you should hold it just to pregnant women but to anybody that might have a health issue without just hearing other thoughts is that mr chairman this has been a subject matter that i have been involved in for the last 20 or more years that's why i'm a strong advocate for eliminating smoking in public places i think all things should be on the table as it relates to the fact that we the public ultimately pays for much of this uh the health uh needs of these persons that are doing harm to themselves or to their loved ones i can also it's an interesting concept i mean i've we've always talked about the drug testing but it's an interesting concept but i guess representative houston please what i mean your problem is you go down a rat hole are you gonna then alcohol test are you gonna go i mean what what you know somebody does a prescription drug i mean i feel like this is so i i mean i'm gonna lose my i appreciate uh representative brown's comments you know lose his love here because i'm not a i'm not a i i respect the private interest too much to support a smoking ban in you know in private entities i guess i'm i you know to me the problem that you have is i feel like this is we're trying to manipulate behavior through taxation which i mean this is not the first instance in which we're trying to manipulate behavior through taxation but i guess i'm i'm i'm just again struggling with the aspect of you mentioned a three-pronged approach and if we've been dealing with this issue for i'm sure represent brown could give me the history here for a long time i don't think any any young kid is uh is shocked to learn that smoking isn't good for their health right they all began at at some point so how would you in you you mentioned earlier price could be a price sensitive to stop people from starting do we have you know i mean do we have other programs i guess again i've put my hesitancy into believing programs are the right way to go but tell me how you begin to narrowly besides just a a taxation which again i'm going to put on my libertarian small government street gets me very nervous about where does this money go to taking out private sector putting the public give me the the best program that you can think of that doesn't include a ban that doesn't include you know taxation that drives specifically towards getting young people to start i mean stop before they ever or not do it before they ever get started well when you look at community programs when you know you have our coordinators going into the schools and educating young people about the ills of smoking that helps i mean that's one of the things that we do lack in the state too we have programs in 92 counties and now we have them in less than 70 counties tobacco prevention cessation took a huge hit in this state when you look at the fact that we used to run the white lies advertising campaign on tv and now we have to really rely on what the cdc is putting out in terms of the um i can't think of that uh campaign where there's tips the tip the tips campaign uh we're not making that significant investment in tobacco prevention success i mean have we seen i mean when that investment dropped what happened to the percentage of smokers is there a correlation and a strong correlation that we could use to justify the investment so when we first when the program was first funded tobacco prevention cessation youth numbers significantly dropped now do i have the numbers right in front of me no but i'll get them for you the number significantly dropped because we made that investment when we stopped investing in those programs we've been tapering off we haven't continued to see that decline that we once saw when we were funded but again uh one of the things that we did see is that and what we know is that when we do pass a tax and i am going to go back to that um we could we could see a 13 reduction in smoking just among youth i mean when you look at the fact that you know uh youth are still being targeted for tobacco products we still have people that are selling you know tobacco products and gas stations where youth are right there products are right there in front and they're targeting their great flavor and orange flavor and purple flavor or whatever these are methods that they're using to target our youth and we have to continue to fight against those with enforcement programs and other programs thank you and maybe we shouldn't let them buy on sunday okay let's start there no tobacco sunday trying to reverse that actually i know i understand and i would like to hear i don't know if anybody from the vape community would like to also from a business perspective because i think we're all supportive of business in indiana and i want to make sure they have an opportunity are there any other questions for danielle representative brown no not for her mr chairman but perhaps the public policy committee as a whole would be interested in submitting a resolution to legislative council about this issue being studied this year because we need to get back to that in in in particular looking at the health aspect of how it's we may be spending less money on on health related issues but on the other hand we have to produce more for those folks that do not have health care coverage so uh i i presented a motion that we as a committee asked for a specific study this summer i think that's something we should consider for next week i don't uh argue that point representative lucas thank you mr chair i just want to point out the fact that state of indiana already recognizes different classifications of smoke or non-smoker for those of us um that are in their insurance we have to sign a waiver determining if we're going to smoke or not smoke and our rates are determined upon that if if we say we're not smokers and we get caught smoking not only do we lose our insurance but we can get fired so already that standard exists for that determination i'm very intrigued about the responsibility from the taxpayer money with the medicaid and how we reduce that and uh very interesting representative gia quinta um i i'll get some data because it's been a while but you know the city of fort wayne's had a comprehensive just real quick on this too the comprehensive smoking ban for quite some time at least 15 years with regards to bars and restaurants and i'll i'll circle back with them to see what impact of health is here and those sorts of things i know there's been some but i haven't seen it recently and then regarding the nicotine test we've discussed tests before and be kind of interesting to see what kind of economic impact of administering the tests versus the results of of actually how many pregnant women we actually do find that that are smoking and then third i'm just kind of curious what the new referee law could someone say i'm a smoker under my religion and therefore wouldn't have to be subject to a nicotine test all right um i do appreciate representative gia quinta bringing up fort wayne and he's a big supporter of allowing locals to decide and individual businesses decide what to do versus being mandated so i by the state level so i i appreciate that um thank you danielle for that and please send us all information that you have that you would like to share from this discussion and would anybody from the vape community like to speak up regarding their concerns or we appreciate the opportunity to talk thank you evan from a business perspective what are your thoughts here that directly could affect your situation well one of the interesting things um that we've seen in the vaping community and there are several studies that are either coming out or have come out in the past month is that vaping actually has the highest rate of success for taking a smoker and turning them into an ex-smoker we've seen several studies that have come out including the university of london that have said that people who switch from smoking to vaping have reparative function that their lung capacity improves um there are a multitude of benefits one of the statistics for you is that someone who uses vaping to stop smoking is a there's a 25 success rate for medication for smoke for a smoking cessation is 19 percent cutting cold turkey is 11 so vaping actually has the highest success rate for getting someone to become an ex-smoker and that's actually what we all got into this to do that's how it all started when somebody comes into our shop and says you know i want to start vaping the first thing we ask them is how much did you smoke what did you smoke we want to find the right method for you to make you an ex smoker that's we are we're rabidly anti-smoking we believe it's a personal choice for the individual but we don't like it we're an ex-smoker so that's it's a we support smoking smoking cessation programs we would like vaping to be included more in those programs to help people have a better alternative that's a more successful alternative to stop smoking evan and of the vaping product how much is used that has nicotine actually in it um it varies somebody who is coming into vaping at the very start typically uses a high nicotine level when i first started vaping i was at about 18 milligrams per milliliter over the period of about a month i started to drop that down faster and faster and faster to where now i'm at zero to three milligrams i mean it just depends um but so it's it's you see people rapidly drop their nicotine levels you know pretty pretty quickly but so most people start at a higher level but is the use of vaping the percentage use of those that vape have non-nicotine is that a large number or have zero nicotine zero that that most most people um uh largely people who have been vaping for a longer period of time let's say a year or more are on the lower level of between zero and three and that's the largest portion of the community so most people are at that lower threshold or at zero thank you evan any questions of representative houston so first of all is that like was that song like a hurricane okay name that band yeah uh neil young i believe scorpions i think scorpions who's in the 80s from here man i'm sorry uh so i mean i i just i have to ask aren't i just exchanging i mean chairman durham mentioned earlier you know um addiction um putting money towards addiction programs uh am i not just changing one form of addiction to another and and that the just to the benefit of those that are surrounding that person instead of smoking and there being a uh ancillary effect other people uh the advantage this rudimentary comments here i just want to be fair is that you know the that only one person is being impacted by the addiction within the vaping is that where would you agree and disagree with that broad-based statement um i would agree in a couple respects but i would largely disagree first nicotine as itself is actually being used in studies right now to help treat alzheimer's it's actually uh the there was a large national institution that actually showed that nicotine itself did not affect uh vascular function that it was the other points of smoking traditional cigarettes or traditional tobacco products that did that nicotine in small doses you know toxicity is related to dosage in any regard so caffeine is addictive sugar is addictive high fructose corn syrup is highly addictive um you know there are many things that we consume on a regular basis that actually are very addictive if you ever go a day without a cup of coffee you get a headache if you go a day without a sugary soda you get more than a headache you know so is nicotine in that realm sure but when we're talking about tobacco harm reduction the significant impact that vaping can have on somebody that switching from smoking traditional or using traditional tobacco products to something that is less impactful such as vaping is significant it's not just about combating addiction and within our community we encourage people to rapidly drop nicotine levels and the reason for that is because there is a a benefit um to um trying different technologies you know you've heard several different terms for devices here such as an e-cigarette and a vape pen and a personal vaporizing device and those things the the more you get involved with the technology the less nicotine you want in those products so we actually encourage people to drop nicotine as as quickly as possible um so i hope that answered the question thank you evan representative smalls evan thanks for being here i'm just wondering about just a piece of the bill on page four it talks about a person may not manufacture sell or distribute a liquid or gel substance containing nicotine or a nicotine liquid container unless it's in a child resistant package is that current standard procedure for most vape shops to put them in child tamper proof bottles or are they non-tamper-proof i would say probably at least 90 percent of the industry within indiana is probably on that level of using those child resistant packaging there are some people mostly what we see is some of the smaller shops may not have all of their product within that line but even national distributors are moving that direction of having child resistant packaging across the board so you would not see that as a substantial burden for the vaping community to have that that component in the law actually if i can if i can speak to that for this one bill um the only thing that actually gives us pause is the july 5th the july 1st of this year just for the tobacco license because we're dealing with we have over 150 shops that we talk to there are significantly other many there are many other shops that we are not um part of or communicate with probably an additional hundred shops that may not know about it they're not already talking to atc so they're not going to get notification now on as of july 1st you could have your entire inventory and your store destroyed that's our only real concern with the bill right now is that and we're going to try to help to get that information out to people we just hope that no business ends up having their inventory seized because they didn't have a permit on july 1st thank you evan representative brown thank you mr chairman so are you all recommending that that date be moved to what point would would be reasonable for those that may have a stock and may not get the word uh um it's it's less of this the stock it's it's the the permit is the bit is the big issue for us um just that timeline i honestly i don't know how you would communicate with the stores that that aren't part of our association there are a lot of like we actually don't work with any any quote unquote head shops we don't talk to them they're not part of our association but they do some of them sell vaping related products how they would find out about it that's that's a a question we have so i don't know what that timeline would be um you know is it an additional three months an additional six months i'm just not i don't know um but we're not willing to throw out the regulation like that we would like to work to maybe have that or some sort of notification process something in there would be would be beneficial and helpful or keep the july first date and move the descript destruction portion back or have something that wouldn't immediate on that day representative lucas thank you mr chairman that's what i was thinking like first time's a warning and next time we come back and check out your shop you better have an application receipt that would be that would be great because because then it's now you're being served with the notification if you didn't find out here's your we came in here's your notification you have to have this it doesn't take 30 days to get the the certificate you can do it online we'll be back in 30 days if you don't have it or a receipt proving that you filed for it then then we take your stuff that's good job all right the first time he's heard that this week on any other any other committee questions thank you evan thank you is there anybody else that'd like to yes please come up and uh state your name and who you represent thank you mr chairman uh members of the committee my name is joe lackey i'm president of the indiana grocery and convenience store association um and we sell a lot of these products also represent the indiana wholesale dealers association who are the tobacco candy wholesalers for indiana you would think that that would automatically make me opposed to what you're proposing here that's not necessarily true but a couple of cautions since you're looking at all these different aspects that i think have potential to impact when you raise tobacco taxes you do not necessarily lose all of those people you show a decrease in tobacco sales that doesn't necessarily mean you've got a decrease in smoking immediately you transfer sales to other locations you mentioned kentucky we're not going to get below kentucky kentucky has basically no tax on cigarettes our retailers in southern indiana don't sell a lot of tobacco because they're going across the border to buy it that will continue you raise the tax here you're just going to push more of them across a lot of them will probably go on sunday so they can get sunday alcoholic beverage sales and cold beer at the same time but that's that's another issue the other thing you've got to be concerned about if you raise taxes is an increase in black market it always happens you get what we call trunk slammers coming in selling them out of the back of trucks and vans and things like that that are completely illegal that means you need to look at maybe taking some of these funds and increasing your enforcement level you're asking atc here to take on a lot of new areas that they've not had before like the vape shops that's not been part of their venue in the past they're going to probably need some of that some of that money for increased funding question i have which wasn't addressed here really are you intending to include e-cigarettes and vapes in this tax are they going to be taxed that's never been addressed if that's going to happen you've got to define them are they an otp they're obviously not a tobacco product i would say they're probably an otp other tobacco product and if that's the case then they're going to need a tax level if you do that then the whole system kind of fits into your tobacco program that you spent a lot of money in years developing that means that in other words if it's a tobacco product by your definition then it has to be sold to a tobacco wholesaler and from a tobacco hostator it can only be sold to a licensed tobacco retailer which is what you already have in this bill you're licensing the vape shop as tobacco retailers so it would make sense to put it all in there that then gives revenue a audit trail where they can make sure that you're getting these tax dollars and all this falls into place i would highly recommend you talk to revenue a little bit revenue has got some real strong ideas about these taxes and how they should be structured but they're they've not been allowed to talk about taxes and it might be something you might want to ask them about it's one of those things they won't talk to you unless you ask them with regard to nicotine it was pointed out that nicotine is not all together bad and i think we've had this discussion with some of you in the past but uh for example the the cure to ebola uh was developed by r.j reynolds and it was nicotine that they were using as the basis for that cure for art for ebola and it still is and it's taking place down in kentucky uh where that's being being developed would strongly urge you to do the the uh the wholesale mandate where it has to go through a wholesaler to a retailer that will that will dramatically help the black market in the counterfeit issues um with that i'll quit if you have any questions i'll attempt to trust you one other question do you mind sharing you and i have talked about some of the language and i think it's you say non-controversial about you'd want to add to this bill we might as well put that on the table as well uh we we would like to well well there's two there's two areas since it's going to go back to i assume go back to ways and means since it's going to be taxed is it going to be recommitted if that's considered um one there is a tax that needs to be gotten rid of that revenue has asked us to help get rid of um which is that we have a tax now on tobacco rolling papers and tubes it was not enforced until this last year as a result of the tobacco settlement where indiana was cited and re and the ag can address this better than i but one of the things we were slammed for and lost some funds on was not enforcing all of the tobacco laws that are on the books this was one that was on the books that we were not enforcing because the law actually requires us to stamp the same thing that are on cigarettes to stamp tobacco rolling papers now if that doesn't make sense to you you're you're with us it makes no sense to us either it makes no sense to revenue what's actually taking place at this point in time is revenue is is when we pay the tax this very minor tax because we just don't sell tobacco papers anymore through our host sailors but if we if we sell any at all we go to revenue give them the money they mail us the tobacco stamps to go on the paper with instructions do not affix these stamps mail them back to us and they keep rotating them in and out of the building so they don't have to have them where stamps printed and they say they're really getting the smell really bad from going back and forth and back and forth regardless they want to take that off the books they'd like to get rid of that and i'll get you more detailed information on that another issue is display of cigarettes there was a mistake made in 2011 where we banned all tobacco from display from self-service all of it that was never the intention that goes beyond the fda regulations and what we would like to do is is allow pipe tobacco and cigars and we've got all these big boxes of cigars we've got these big cans of pipe tobacco and a lot of our stores we just simply don't have enough room to put them behind the counter and fda agrees with that and says that they can be self-service we would like to correct that uh right now that is not being enforced uh atc is giving us until the end of this session to to try to fix it because frankly they don't want they they would like to have the fda and the indiana laws the same for enforcement purposes they get the best compliance that way and they get the best enforcement from their atc officers but that was and you believe that was a fix that wasn't supposed to happen or i mean this would be a fix it was two of those that it wasn't supposed to happen the sponsor of the bill actually uh at the conclusion that was a short session he got very involved it couldn't be amended it was kicked out of the policy committee and you were not the chairman at that time it was kicked out of the policy committee um it was a mistake that's why there was a mistake we didn't intend to do that they can fix it in the senate it got over in the senate if it was amended in the senate it was going to be a dead bill it wasn't going to get out so they didn't amend it and but the but the sponsor of the bill sent a letter to the governor and to the atc asking them not to enforce that portion of it because they were going to fix it and one thing led to another and it never got fixed so it's still not being enforced uh but that's going to that's going to stop at the end of the session representative clare thank you mr chairman and thank you mr lackey i just wanted to clarify something because we've had a lot of confusion about the issue of defining e-cigarettes and what they really are and you made the statement i think a minute ago that e-cigarettes are not tobacco products no right now they're not defined as tobacco products but they're not being taxed right well one of the documents that i've used as i've worked on this e-cig legislation comes from the faq section of the views e-cig website so views v-usc is a type of e-cigarette correct yes and it's manufactured by who uh i can't answer that reynolds right rjr right rjr so i just so on on uh rjr's website for the vieux product one of the faqs is our views digital vapor cigarettes considered tobacco products and the answer is yes because views products contain tobacco-derived nicotine they meet the definition of tobacco products under the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act so i just want to clarify for everybody that even the manufacturers are regarding at least this major manufacturers regarding uh e-cigarettes as a tobacco product i i have no basis for disagreeing with that i i think you you look at the just as a citizen of the state if you look at if you look at the manufacturers of the e-cigarettes the major manufacturers they're tobacco companies right and it's not unusual it's being done in other states and understand i wasn't encourage you to tax e-cigarettes i'm just asking you if you intend to do that then you've got to consider what the definition is and i think one of the definitions that was put forward by revenue before was that that it includes e-cigarettes and anything that can be used in an e-cigarette you don't want to you stay away from the nicotine definition i would be the recommendation because that's going to get very confusing and how do you expect an excise officer to look at that when he goes into a vape shop is there nicotine in it or is there not he's going to have to depend on the label but what difference does it make i mean if you're going to if you're going to control it you control it and if it has the capability of going into an e-cigarette or is a vape whatever however you want to do it and then i think that that's you make it uniform across the board at that point you get the best enforcement and the best compliance thank you um any other questions thank you thank you mr le not a question i just think we should text thank you e-cigarettes like we do regular cigarettes thank you representative brown is there anybody else that would like to debate argue from the attorney general's office yes thank you mr chairman my name is larry hopkins with the attorney general's office i wanted to maybe just answer some of the questions that have come up first of all as it relates to this particular bill on the july 1st deadline for the retail certificate we'd like to keep that in place if if you want to allow just a warning on the first appearance i don't think that's a problem i think that's what we would expect atc to do anyway but one of the big issues is we just don't know where these shops are and i think the sooner we can figure out where they're all at and get somebody out there that'll be helpful i think that also will help the other bill that's going through and that a lot of those provisions don't kick in until the following year but it would be nice to know where all those shops are before those provisions kick in so we definitely like to keep the july 1st deadline if at all possible as it relates to extending the current excise tax not increasing it just extending it to e-cigarettes obviously our office has been in favor of that we sent you all a letter a couple weeks ago about that and i would just point out that you know one of the the recent studies that has caught everybody's attention is the rate of e-cigarette use among teenagers it's doubled in three years and so this is a product that has captured the fancy of teenagers and they are being drawn to it in droves and especially with teenagers one of the ways to deter them from smoking is to increase the price point and so i think that is a major focus for our office in the tobacco-free community is making sure we don't start a whole new generation of smokers whether they're vaping and nicotine is regardless of anything else it's still very addictive and so we don't want teenagers to start becoming vapers and then lead to becoming regular tobacco smokers so just extending the excise tax to e-cigarettes is one way to do it without increasing the tax but as other folks have testified obviously increasing the tax you can do that and still be the lowest in surrounding states and get back maybe some of the money that the state lost to the tobacco companies in the arbitration and keep in mind the arbitration money that money is being paid to the state to cover past health care costs so if and i you know our medicaid budget is uh what is it six billion dollars now so the tobacco companies since the inception of this agreement uh a little over 15 years ago have paid the state over a billion dollars just to recoup past costs so if you just think back in the 50s and 60s if this could have been foreseen and you could have been paying those costs as you go rather than recouping them now in arrears as we're forced to do be much better deal for the taxpayers so just a word that i think any tax whether it's extended or increased i think would be help offset the cost to the taxpayers for those medicaid expenses thank you what would you guess or estimate that the extension of the excise tax to the e-cigarettes how much would that generate well we did some analysis based on the state of minnesota who has had the tax in place for over a year now and we came up with estimates depending upon smoking rates in indiana versus minnesota that it could raise anywhere between 8 million on the low side and probably about 24 million on the high side per year 24 million thank you any other questions representative smalls um i'm curious about you talked about the effective date of the bill and it's important to you to remain july 1st would it would it be would it have a negative impact if we amended the bill to make the effective date july 1st but for the issuance of the certificates the tobacco certificates to people who do not have them now would we be able to do something that would say for businesses that are in place on july 1st 2015 they would have a 90-day window to get their permit would that somehow well i i think we would as i indicated we'd be supportive that if somebody didn't get their certificate which just to remind you getting the certificate is very easy you just get onto the website you pay your fee and you get your certificate so but if they didn't have it by july 1st i'd like to keep the the requirement there but be in favor of giving them a warning later a warning letter or something that they had to get it within the next 90 days or something thank you can i follow up representative smalls so what i see happening here is if i'm a shop and i don't have that certificate and i know that i don't have to get that certificate and i don't have to pay that expense until you catch me without it and i know that you're gonna warn me so i would just i think people would generally just wait until they got caught that one that one time and then be compelled so they don't lose the products in their store and that would put a burden on the atc to go around and seek compliance with these businesses that don't have that certificate i don't see there there's no motivation other than to do the right thing which is a good motivation but it's not enough to motivate everybody well practically i don't think atc is going to show up on everybody's doorstep on july 1st and be checking to see if they have their certificate it's going to take them a while to do that so i don't think there's going to be kind of the drastic effect that that maybe was discussed and i think normally they wouldn't be somewhat lenient on a law that's just taking effect so i i don't think you really need to do anything i guess i'm just suggesting i would like to keep the july 1st deadline if all possible with one brief question i'll be very brief but if i was in business and the law said that you could you could seize and destroy my inventory um i would base my concern on what the law says and not the the generosity and kindness of a governmental agency not disparaging any governmental agencies i don't disagree with you on that i can take my stuff and throw it away that's a problem i i i don't disagree thank you and we'll start wrapping up we have one brief question from representative lucas thank you mr chairman um representative smalls brings up a good point so to address
YARgpGabwLo,03-25-2012,1940,ID,house bill 498 adds the e-cigarettes to uh existing registration system for distributors and vendors of tobacco products this bill does nothing more than ad distributors and retailers it does not cause rep at the does not require reporting does not require taxing does not limit the sales other than to what's currently in law it uses the existing tobacco sales registry run through the department of health and welfare this registry is free and it's online and i guess the question is why do we do this well as i was investigating vaping and e-cigarettes neither health and welfare nor the tax commission had any idea who was selling these uh nicotine delivery devices we currently have laws on the book in the same chapter that that we're meant proposed to amend that makes it illegal to sell these devices and solutions to miners but we don't know who sells them or who distributes them the tobacco industry has already begun marketing e-cigarettes using the same techniques and processes that were used before and in your folder there should be some examples both of the old cigarette advertising and the new e-cigarette advertising as you can see it was fairly easy to reproduce the marketing plan from before and one of the outcomes of the marketing plan was the youth taking up tobacco youth uptake of e-cigarettes and vaping now outpaces traditional tobacco more start on e-cigarettes and flavored nicotine solutions than on combustible or chewable tobacco and while there's some evidence that e-cigarettes like other nicotine delivery systems patches gums etc may have a role in tobacco cessation programs there is no evidence that non-smokers are benefited by vaping the yet the flavored vape whether it's strawberry or bubble gum butterscotch or whatever is an attractive hazard it took decades to identify the heart full effects of smoking we all remember now probably laughing at the advertisements of physicians advertising cigarettes because they were smooth and cooling to the lungs well but subsequent to that time and science has shown that that was dangerous and harmful vaping and e-cigarettes are new there's not enough time to know what the long-term effects is but there is laboratory evidence of cellular damage to the respiratory epithelium the cells that line the respiratory tract and of the alveoli of the lungs from the uh chemicals that are in flavored vape so it's entirely appropriate i believe that the to use this existing registry uh to track the vendors and distributors of a product that is it currently illegal and may well prove to be harmful mr chairman i'd be happy to answer questions thank you representative are there any questions representing varushi representing vanuatu thank you mr chairman and representative hershey uh the people most of it is probably gone already through the convenience stores that already have the permit uh there are some you know strictly vape stores and stuff like that they are don't they have to have a sales permit in order to be in operations uh representative um mr chairman and representative they may have to have a local business permit but they do not have to have a register if there's not sell if they are not selling tobacco they do not have to have a registration with the idaho tobacco project the idaho tobacco project also provides a list of the vendors that local law enforcement and others can do monitoring of sales to minors if they don't appear on the list they can't be monitored follow-up follow-up um but don't these uh mr chairman of representative russi don't these businesses need a resale permit from this from the government so the government already knows that these businesses are out there in other words in order to collect sales tax you have to have a resale permit and so if they're collecting sales taxes they the government already knows these businesses are are out there they're not you know hidden in the back closet somewhere representative mr chairman and representative and woody according to the tax commission on my conversations with them and i had several they cannot tell whether you're selling apples or selling vape they just get a dollar amount on the sales okay thank you further questions of representative roushi representative redmond i think a chairman would i had a question now some of these vapes are not tobacco is that correct are they on tobacco mr chairman and representative yes some of them do not contain nicotine they contain flavoring uh they contain coloring but um there's two two ways to my mind that uh that vaping has a potential for harm first is a lot of them do contain nicotine and nicotine is an addictive substance and frankly there's evidence that if you can't get your nicotine from vaping you people buy cigarettes so yes you can use nicotine delivery systems to get off of smoking but if you get addicted to nicotine you go see searching the nicotine so that's one way that they're harmful the second is the volatilization of some of the flavor and coloring chemicals there's a study from harvard that talks about three flavoring chemicals in particular that are associated with a disease called bronchiolitis obliterans now bronchioles are the very tiniest air tubes before you get down to the air sacs or the alveoli and these chemicals are known hazards in the workplace uh this the coffee roasting uh painful if these chemicals are in the air they can cause this lung disease nobody knows if you're inhaling them directly from a vape apparatus how much how long but this is the the evidence is that these chemicals cause the epithelial cells to separate from each other and round up and in at least other mammals cause inflammation of those small bronchioles so the suspicion is that they do cause damage that the damage could be serious and permanent but again it'll take probably 30 to 40 years before we see it vaping is not is not a long-standing or old phenomenon it's a new phenomenon for the questions of representative rushi thank you mr chairman thank you representative apparently we do have um and aaron bennett uh that wishes to testify if you'd come forward and uh please state your name and who you represent ma'am the podium shores good morning mr chairman and members of committee my name is aaron bennett i serve as government relations director for the american heart association american stroke association in idaho and i'm here today in support of house spell 498. the aha is a non-profit nonpartisan organization working to prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke as leading causes of death through the support of research and evidence-based policy electronic cigarettes are still relatively new technology with frequent revisions and updates and relatively little regulation these factors among others have delayed the ability to obtain accurate data about the use characteristics and long-term effects of e-cigarette products on public health however preliminary studies indicate e-cigarette usage can lead to increases in heart rate and blood pressure atherosclerosis and coronary restriction there is also a potential to renormalize smoking behaviors promoting nicotine addiction and serving as a gateway to the use of other harmful tobacco products idaho statute already prohibits e-cigarette sales to minors however we're seeing the use of these products increasing year over year particularly in the youth market according to the 2015 idaho youth risk behavior survey 24.8 percent of idaho students in grades 9 through 12 had used an electronic vapor product in the past 30 days with 45.2 percent of idaho students having tried these products at least once as availability and diversity of these products increases we've seen more advertising focused on youth using the same appeals tobacco companies in previous decades as you've seen in your handout from representative rushi house bill 498 requiring individuals or businesses selling electronic cigarettes to register with the state will improve the ability to collect data regarding product sales and distribution which will help us understand the ability or understand and analyze the youth focused markets influence and help prevent youth access to these products before we have a comprehensive understanding of the public health impacts they might have we must work to reduce youth access to these products and as we learn more about the long-term health consequences of using e-cigarettes house bill 498 will help get us there the aha supports house bill 498 and urge you send it to the floor with a do pass recommendation might stand for any questions thank you are there any questions of miss bennett thank you thank you appreciate it very much is there anyone else in the audience that wishes to come forward to testify therefore against house bill 498 let the record reflect that no one else came forward committee house bill 498 is properly before the committee represented hixon mr chairman i would make a motion to send house bill 498 to the floor they do pass a recommendation and i may speak to my motion mr chairman go ahead thank you i think this is a probably a level-headed piece of legislation i mean these are relatively new in the marketplace it would be a good idea just in case we do have problems down the road to uh to have some sort of a paper paper trail leading back to the sources of these i'd like to see where it goes from there so mr chairman i would i would hope for a yes vote on this piece of legislation any further comments discussion for the motions hearing none all those in favor of the original motion say aye aye those opposed no you wish to be recorded uh record representative vander water's no chair votes i and house bill 498 will be sent to the florida do-pass recommendation representative rushi would you uh sponsor both of uh those on the floor yes sir i'd be happy to thank you next is uh house bill 453 medical lab science practice act representative king if you come forward state your name and who you represent ma'am the podium is yours uh thank you mr chairman and committee uh for the record i am

collaborative effort and trying to get something that we can all go forward with thank you very much um next agenda item is house bill 500 medicare reimbursement rate jeff morrell intermountain hospital mr morrell if you'd come forward state your name and who you represent sir the podium is yours thank you mr chairman committee members my name is jeff morell i'm the ceo of intermountain hospital located in boise idaho we treat mental health patients uh adolescents and adults and uh this bill is a technical correction from house bill 298 that was passed in last legislative session this correction has to do with the reimbursement rate for adolescent patients specifically for free-standing hospital the previous bill identified the state portion of reimbursement only and not the matching federal funds for the general funding of all adolescent what this bill original language would do is actually reduce reimbursement to intermountain household by
w6lvIoVVVE8,03-13-2015,3023,ID,infraction law one of them was increasing the infraction maximum from 100 to 300 we also restored in the legislature the authority to set fines that had been given to the supreme court and one of the provisions that was in the bill was to deal with a few infractions that were out there that did not have specific fines but that used language such as not to exceed or up to a certain amount and that's inconsistent with infractions the idea behind infractions is you write a ticket you know the amount you can pay it or you can go contested in court in the interim the supreme court did identify two of these and so what we're doing is we are changing those to set infraction amounts and removing subsection 4 in 18 113a because that's no longer needed so the two sections flooding on highways is just set as at fifty dollar fine which was there already and uh public smoking uh at seventeen fifty and that was up to fifty but that 1750 is comes from the the schedule said this over the supreme court so that doesn't there's no budget impact it's pretty much neutral so that's that's the bill and thank you representative i'm really glad to reread 183904 because sometimes i have a little trouble with sprinklers going on the road when there's wind out so i thank you for bringing that part so i could refresh my memory senator souza thank you madam chairman representative lucha i have one quick question for you is there a i see the 17.50 uh charge yes and the 15.50 charge is there a 12 sandwich in here somewhere um i think it's i think it's a new york state the 1750 not not at today's beef crisis i don't think any further discussion on house bill 121. senator hager madam chairman i would move uh we sent house bill 121 to the floor with a due pass recommendation [Music] it's there it's been moved by senator hager during second by senator bear the house bill 121 be sent to the floor any further discussion see none those in favor signify by saying i'm aye those opposed bill will be sent to the floor house bill 159 representative you're doing really good in fact i think the senate committee will be very happy because they'll be about 20 minutes ahead of schedule excellent this is uh house bill 159 dealing with the use of by minors of tobacco products in in the prior law everything was all jumbled together at consumption uh and distribution so what we did is we we separated those out and and just had the consumption use uh offenses in subsection one and then the selling and distribution and made a new subsection for that and any uh use uh violations is uh an infraction consistent with the one we just looked at 1750 and i would i would add in that it's not just 1750 there are court costs and fees by the time you get through all those it's about 72 or 74 dollars so it's it's not just 1750. the uh the second part the distribution or or sale of tobacco or there's subsection three false identification obtaining tobacco under false id that would be a first offense of infraction 200 and then it would flip over into a misdemeanor if it's a repeat so those are the changes there i guess i'm i'm just had a grandson of a good friend who was caught with tobacco at school and it was a 200 fine and i see the 200 here but it doesn't seem to fit in with a first-time possession of of tobacco can you explain that a little bit to me how that works yeah madam chair that would have been a misdemeanor set by the judge because right now that it is a misdemeanor so he probably got more than just a ticket written i would assume i i thought i thought it was but it's a juvenile offense so it doesn't show you know it's handled as a juvenile offense two hundreds quite a bit for a kid to work off well we're reducing man i'm sure we're reducing that at least for consumption and use but for the distribution that would still be he wasn't distributing senator burgoyne thank you madam chair and representative i uh um i like i like this i have a question about uh lines of 29 well 28 29 30 to 32 on the reduction on the misdemeanor to 30 days and a 300 fine was that done because of a sense of that's what it ought to be that's just just and reasonable or was there some thought that by reducing the misdemeanor penalty we might avoid uh public defender issues can you just explain why that's there madam chairman senator burgorn the former because once it's a misdemeanor you still implicate the public public defender and madam jeremy i have another question senator thank you the final sentence of the provision on lines 32-30 is not amended but i'm just wondering if the way we're changing the statutes it talks about in addition to the penalties uh which to me at least doesn't sound like the infraction would be a penalty i think it's a civil violation perhaps the court can require the attendance of the tobacco awareness program and that would seem to me to be particularly apt with respect to a simple consumption a 1750 fine and go to a tobacco awareness program i was just wondering the way we've set this up is the court going to have that option given the word penalties there in the sentence uh madam chairman senator burgoyne uh you raise a good point that hasn't been raised before and i would assume if you just read it it's ambiguous as to whether it applies to everything or misdemeanor but because it's in penalties are civil or criminal however just in the application of uh infraction laws i would assume they would just be writing a ticket and there wouldn't really be any further jurisdiction to impose that in an infraction unless perhaps they contested the ticket and then went in in front of the judge that's certainly something we could look at in the future to clear clarify sarah davis uh thank you representative a bunch of 14 year olds head out walking home one has a pack of cigarettes they took from mom and dad obviously that triggers the infraction part to be in possession and their friend says give me one of those now are they guilty of distribution representative senator lodge uh senator davis say yes in in the pure sense of the term uh that's uh certainly uh would be within that second part of the section you have to remember that all of this was a misdemeanor to start with anyway and so they originally would have been charged with a misdemeanor and so we're trying to parse this out as best we can maybe there's some more minute mechanic work we can do with it but i think it's an improvement from where it was follow-up and i agree with your representative and what we're looking at here is better than what we have right now uh but was there much conversation or thought about uh defining distribution to be more than x number of whatever so that you you keep well you just finished that up for me thank you madam chair uh senator davis no we didn't drill down that deep um there is certainly discretion on the part of an officer to just give a possession ticket as opposed to a distribution ticket but we and we can we could drill down at some time in the future if if we want to do that any further questions represented johnson thank you madam chair um [Music] i'm just trying to make sure that i'm reading this so what are what is or what are the violations of subsection four and five uh okay for a minor who is assisting with a random unannounced inspection okay these are exculpatory so if you've got somebody who's out helping abc and uh trying to do the sting that protects them madam chair i got ahead of myself i apologize i read that and i was thinking something else but thank you okay thank you madam chairman i would move that we send house bill 159 to the floor with a new pass kathy do you still want to testify no i just wanted to share we're supportive of the bill and all the same points i raised earlier with 101 and 102 stand for for this bill as well okay thank you okay so um senator hagerdorn do i have second all right um sarah senator hagendorn has moved that house bill 159 be sent to the floor and with senator bear uh seconding is there any further discussion seeing none those in favor signify by saying i i those opposed motion will be sent to the floor the committee you did you did very well thank you very much representative you did very well and we have a long agenda on monday and if you could do this very same thing on monday it would be really great um thank you for uh coming in on friday afternoon i know it's difficult for those of you that have to travel a long distance and we have a pretty full agenda as i said for monday and some um on wednesday and then i hope to give you next friday off since you've been so good good today and if there isn't anything else that needs to come before the committee we are adjourned and thank you very much it'll be um nice enjoy your weekend um um okay oh
sDjgqpX7mLg,04-28-2016,3433,CO,this you can follow along and we have the uh the meat of of each little statement in the packet if you care to look at it um previous grant awards from 2011-12 of the communities listed fountain manitou golden pueblo steamboat and breckenridge have all passed local otp licenses there is a direct correlation between these grant dollars and the new local licensure as a condition of receiving these amendment 35 dollars applicants for the 216-18 need to be included to include required and optional strategies one of the required strategies uh page five of the handout um that uh passed to strengthen non-cigarette ordinances and basically what we're trying to do is just basically level this out um we're saying that amendment 35 dollars shouldn't be used for political ads and and should be used for enforcement in and we have an amendment uh l zero zero five it in your possession and uh i think that will clarify a lot of the bill that's basically the the meat of the bill now representative singer thank you madam chair i'll be brief as representative coram was as well the fundamental question here is whether or not taxpayer approved dollars should go to political advocacy or whether we should be spending those monies on direct interventions to make sure that youth don't get access to tobacco what this bill with this amendment really focuses on is simply that issue of was it the voter's intent to make sure that these taxpayer approved dollars in amendment 35 were to be required to be used for political advocacy or actual prevention and intervention efforts outside the political arena i'll leave it at that and either open it up to questions i know we have quite a few witnesses signed up in testimony and and i want to be fair to the entire committee so we can make sure that we are able to get back onto the floor at an appropriate time and thank you for your attention thank you representative art thank you madam chair so the bill's been amended down to this issue why did it start with the registry and everything else and how did we get from there to here before the committee hearing representative singer thank you madam chair well we wanted to add a few wrinkles to your brain and to your brow i think what we tried to do is we really wanted to create something that split the difference and i give the tobacco prevention individuals here a lot of credit now the industry is coming to the table saying look we should be on the radar we should be catching the bad actors and what we attempted to do is basically split the difference and say you know what maybe a licensure isn't the way to go but at least we should do a registry to get these folks on the radar but the trade-off there was to eliminate the local issue as you can tell that is an incredibly complex issue very and a very um passionate issue and so instead of dealing with with the bigger issue at hand as to how we get all of these different um tobacco retailers on the radar what we've done is really eliminate that component saying we should increase inspections that's the first part of the bill on lines one through eight and then the second part of the bill says we don't need to be directing money to political advocacy we can we can do something better with these dollars we can follow the voters intent and and make sure that we're doing the right thing so it's it's a very powered down version i'm not sure if you want to talk about previous iterations of the bill um i understand that we have to adopt this amendment but that that's how we got from where we were to where we are today representative rosenthal thank you madam shared thank you representatives what does it mean political advocacy representative singer so if you turn to um in your packet you'll see something with a little sticky note on it or a little tab and if you open to page 5 of 12 one of the things that's required is that grantees that are receiving these amendment 35 dollars are required to work to pass or strengthen non-cigarette tobacco retail license ordinances so basically what this is saying is um we're using taxpayer-funded dollars to actually pass city ordinances city laws if you look at the language of the bill we specify that um these should not these dollars should not be going to policy initiatives or advocacy efforts that encourage or promote elected officials so to uh introduce laws ordinances resolutions or charter provisions uh that create or strengthen tobacco related business taxation licensing or fees so once again the heart of the issue being should state taxpayer dollars that people voted for be specifically routed to this one um political advocacy avenue committee are there any further questions of our sponsors there being none well we will now enter into the witness testimony phase on house bill 16 1370 and sponsors you have 13 opposed three support and one for questions only how would you like to proceed i think we'll go with the opposition first in the order that they signed up and and just for the committee is where i may be called to testify on another bill i'm not walking out on you guys forever i'll be back thank you we'll first start with gabrielle kaplan and i want to share with everyone in the room due to the number of people we have to testify we want to make sure everyone has an opportunity that your testimony will be timed at two minutes each so if you happen to hear something that you had in your mind you want to testify you may want to regroup your thoughts to maximize your two minutes and you'll see that there's a little timer there on the table at green it means it's go when it gets to yellow you're at 30 seconds and red we will cut off your testimony so we'll ask gabrielle kaplan to please come forward thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent good afternoon madam chairwoman my name is gabriel dr gabriel kaplan i'm the branch chief for health promotion and chronic disease prevention in the prevention services division of the department of public health and environment and i'm here on behalf of dr larry wolck the department's executive director and colorado's chief medical officer to express the agency's significant concerns with the provisions of house bill 16 1370. we've been concerned about this legislation throughout its life but we'll share that it's been difficult to track what is in or out of this bill at any one time and we are still not clear what policy problem this is intended to solve tobacco remains a leading killer of coloradans it is one of the few products sold in colorado today which one used as directed will kill you approximately 5 000 and 100 coloradans every year succumb to tobacco and thousands more suffer from illnesses and poor health brought on by their use of tobacco this cost the state over 2 billion in direct healthcare costs and lost productivity and taxpayers bear much of the brunt of this to the tune of roughly 576 dollars per colorado household per year we know that 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking before they were 18 years old and the tobacco industry knows this as well they know the best way to build a pipeline of future consumers is to hook them early and thanks to years of study by scholars and data and evidence uh reviewed by others such as the centers for disease control we know the evidence-based strategies that work to try to prevent this we have two main strategies the first is to encourage and offer opportunities for smokers to quit and the second is to prevent our youth from ever initiating smoking we do this through a grant program and each grant application asks applicants to identify the areas in which they would like to do their work and to select those and the ones that are in that menu available to them are all evidence-based as instructed by statute and the cdc has found that initiatives of this kind that are referred to in this legislation are evidence-based and they're the best way to reduce such initiation and when they've been done in colorado they've led to reductions in youth access to tobacco from 40 percent mr kaplan thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for our sponsor representative art thank you madam chair it's my question day um thank you for coming have you had a chance to see the amendment l005 i have madam chairman yes representative madam chair thank you um would you like to speak to that amendment please mr kaplan sure uh thank you madam chair um so the language of this amendment is concerning on several several levels uh the constitution was amendment amended in 2004 by the voters and at the very beginning of that amendment it states that colorado should deter children and youth from starting smoking and the tobacco tax revenues will be used to expand health care for children and low-income populations for tobacco education programs and for the prevention and treatment of cancer heart disease and lung disease and 16 percent of those revenues are appropriated for school community-based and state-wide tobacco education programs designed to reduce initiation of tobacco use by children and youth promote cessation of youth of tobacco use and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke so it's very clear that the grantees with these funds are expected to educate the members of their community at all levels regardless of their position whether they be private citizens or officials working within the government of the county or members of county commissioners or city elected officials that education is what the voters of colorado wanted we are concerned that this language that prohibits any activity any initiative that would encourage or promote a member of a city council or of a county commissioner to take an action such as to propose legislation would be barred from those grantees uh we have some concerns that that's a violation of what the intent in the constitution and when the voters voted for it is we've asked the governor's legal counsel and they said that there are a lot of questions raised about the constitutionality of this kind of language because it is overly broad we have had conversations with some individuals uh actually of the legislative body about this work uh and the previous explanation of the concerns that were shared with us was around the term lobbying and lobbying is much more narrowly defined than the notion of encouraging or promoting policy initiatives that limit access to tobacco finally i would like to share with you um a couple of pieces of material and information that we share regularly in public health one is and i can make this available if you like it's the 10 essential services of public health and you'll see that one of the key services of public health this is an approved document from the field of public health that is used by all public health officials employees members of our community across the country it's advocated and supported and endorsed by the american public health association and you can see number five right here is develop policies and then number six is mobilize community partnerships unfortunately the development of policies and the mobilization of community partnerships could be potentially prescribed by this amendment language furthermore if you look at a document that i also have here which is an mmwr this is the morbidity and mortality weekly review from the cdc it talks about the 10 great public health achievements of the united states in the last 100 years of the 20th century and you'll see that there are important initiatives that uh we can thank every day for saving the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens and our family members motor vehicle safety as an example of this safe and healthier foods is an example of this the control of infectious disease is another example of this family planning is another example of this fluoridation of community drinking water and finally recognition of tobacco use as a health hazard in every one of those instances the public health community was actively involved in educating policymakers around this country about the evidence for different kinds of policy initiatives and what impacts that those would have and members of a community that want to ask those questions and ask what are the best things that we can do to prevent our youth from getting tobacco and getting hold of tobacco those things would be potentially prescribed by this amendment so we have very deep concerns thank you representative rosenthal thank you madam chair thank you sir so could you tell me a little bit more about this uh 500 uh 500 what is it 520 000 oh 550 000 or what's what's the amount that's currently allocated uh from which um i guess the bill uh l005 says 520 thousand dollars and and then there's part of that money is gonna go towards these new inspectors so what is that money being used for now uh that uh yeah mr capps thank you madam chair so uh you may want to ask the sponsors that same question uh under the original legislation um which the legislature enacted as sort of authorizing after the amendment was approved by the voters 350 000 was set aside for the department of revenue to do inspections and to make the to really cover the costs that they were going to have as a result of the amendment 35 legislation this amendment increases that amount by 170 000 to a total of hundred and twenty thousand dollars so it would increase the revenues available to the department of uh revenue for these inspections and for other associated responsibilities by one hundred and seventy thousand dollars and uh it directs that specifically for the concept of enforcement which is a department of revenue program representative rosenthal thank you madam chair so basically there's really no net loss to that fund because it's going from 350 to 520 and then part of that money is going towards these inspectors and yet well what about the original fund where this 350 is coming from where's that coming from mr kaplan thank you madam chair so uh there's a there's the original revenues that get raised uh as a result of the amendment and uh i think currently we're getting as a state about 140 million dollars and then there's a formula within um the actual amendment in the constitution which says that 48 will be allocated for this purpose and 16 will be allocated for this purpose uh and so within that uh those provisions there was money set aside 350 000 of that overall budget of 140 million dollars for the department of revenue to cover their costs of implementing it and so this uh legislation this initiative would take monies from that fund raised by the tax the tax on tobacco products and on cigarettes and increased the allotment to the department of revenue by 170 000. this would decrease the amount of revenues that would be available to all the other recipients of that money who range from the child health insurance program to medicaid to the early detection prevention and treatment fund for cancer and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and also for our tobacco control education efforts thank you committee representative thurlow thank you madam chair thank you doctor i'm still trying to get my mind around that concept of how much money there is is the money that's being taken in the bill a big amount or is it a small amount you're talking about the whole pie is 140 million dollars and then how does it break down from there can you or is there someone else here that can tell us who gets what i think there's some that's allocated to local communities and how much what's the relativity of this amount in the bill mr kaplan thank you madam chair so i uh took the liberty of refreshing my memory uh of section 21 of the colorado constitution and i uh printed that out before i came i have 10 pages of well 10 copies of that of that section of the constitution i can share that with the members of the committee and the breakdowns of the revenue are are listed in that amendment to the constitution so i can read from it um 46 of such revenues are appropriated that's from the 140 million 46 of this goes for the children's basic health plan to cover enrollment through that 19 percent is available to fund comprehensive primary care through any qualified colorado provider through the colorado medical assistance act then there are further definitions around that 16 of such revenues are appropriated for school and community uh state and statewide tobacco education programs those are funds that come to the department of public health so we get 16 of the 140 million dollars for our state tobacco grants program and that right now i think is about 21 million dollars we also get 16 for this prevention early detection treatment and cardiovascular pulmonary disease fund and that goes to a number of different programs it goes to breast and cervical cancer screening it goes to what we call our cancer cardiovascular pulmonary disease grants program it goes to the office of health equity grants program and it goes to a few other smaller items as well within the department and then three percent of such revenues are appropriated for health related purposes uh that provide revenue to the state's general fund the old age pension fund and municipal and county governments to compensate them for the reductions in cigarette sales that they experienced as a result of tobacco of amendment 35. representative syas all right thank you thank you sir and this may be something the sponsors want to address as well i'm looking at the amendment and i always get a little bit uh jittery when we start talking about things that seem to uh that seem to impinge on speech or forms of speech and i'm just wondering if i heard your testimony correctly it sounds as though what you're saying is that if a an employee of an entity uh who received this this funding were to themselves want to have a conversation to try and persuade an elected official to follow a certain course of action that they would be prohibited from having that conversation am i understanding your testimony correctly mr kaplan thank you madam chair uh that is that is my interpretation of the language if you look at the language it says um i think the exact language they use is any uh initiative that would encourage or promote um the elected official at a city or county or municipal level to make it a proposal to amend their charter their statutes etc and so i think the question is what initiatives uh do you prohibit that and then how do you sort of demonstrate a causal effect between the statements of an individual and the decisions of an elected official at the county level so if for instance we had the state public health department sorry the county public health department in for instance jefferson county was talking about the percentage of youth in jefferson county who are able to obtain cigarettes illegally and was talking about the different kinds of policies that are available to the county to get cigarettes to a point where they're harder to get a hold of and if that discussion was held in any forum and a city official learned about that discussion and thought hmm maybe i should write something for our city municipal ordinance that would be considered as the language is defined a prohibited activity it doesn't sort of limit it to lobbying it it really doesn't even limit it to political advocacy it doesn't talk about political advocacy it talks about initiatives that encourage or promote policy change representative science thank you madam chair and yes sir i think as i'm reading it now it's it's to fund policy initiatives or advocacy efforts and i i would like to give the the sponsors a chance if the if they want to address that as well but that that that is sort of how i'm reading it looking at that now and that does i have to say make me a little nervous thank you committee are there any further questions of mr kaplan representative coram uh yes i i have a question um and if members if you'll look at your handout number six in 2012 the state auditor um report questioning the use of amendment 35 to fund local initiatives and the disagreement from the department and was asked for the to seek a formal uh attorney general's opinion to date that has never happened is can you tell me why that never happened mr kaplan thank you madam chair it actually has happened so uh i can sort of recount for the members of the committee uh the staff of the state auditor's office was concerned about some of the policy work that was being done we explained to them that we felt that this was allowed under the statute they then said well let's take an opinion from the office of legislative legal counsel the office of legislative legal counsel said that the policy work that was being done by the grantees was in their view all acceptable except for some of the work around some of the secondhand smoke initiatives but they specifically said that the retail types of initiatives that grantees were working on were acceptable under the statute we went from there to the attorney general's office and we asked for them for an opinion and they said that any activity that green teas engage in which educates members of their community regardless of their position in that community uh that is related to policy was allowable and we can share that document with you uh if you like it was a table produced by the chief attorney general official assigned to the department i'd like to have that thank you committee are there any further questions of mr kaplan there being none thank you for being with us today and answering all the questions thank you madam chair i do have a letter from the chairman uh the chairs of the tobacco review committee they were not able to be here they're both doctors and they had patients to see today and i would like to submit that in the record for um for ural's review if you are interested thank you we'll make sure committee members receive that next we'll have jeff king thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent for the record i'm chair my name is dr jeff kane i'm a family doctor in denver i'm representing the colorado academy of family physicians and also children's hospital colorado please proceed with your testimony thank you very much i'm actually coming to talk with you a little bit as someone that's actually worked with amendment 35 dollars i've helped train family doctors to talk to kids about tobacco i've actually talked to people in city council meetings i've talked to people the state legislature we just heard a moment ago that tobacco causes 5 000 deaths a year that's a big number but for me it's a gentleman named carl that i helped take care of towards the end of his life and what i know is that the kids start using tobacco at an early age and there are 3 400 children every year in colorado that become addicted to tobacco i think we should do whatever we can to help kids choose not to be addicts to tobacco to help keep them safe from those tobacco-caused illnesses tobacco causes more illness than aids cocaine suicide homicide alcohol fire firearms automobile accidents all those things combined we have a lot of rules and policies to help us with that the centers for disease control says three things help keep kids away from it make it more expensive do advertising to help them not do that and thirdly to have local ordinances to make it harder for kids to be able to buy tobacco that's what we're talking about having prohibiting people like me from talking to local city councils about how to help make it harder for kids to buy tobacco so i took time off of my office today because i think that's really important for kids health for my patients health because i don't want to have to take care of more carls so that's my my comments in brief i'm sure thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions of this witness representative west thank you madam chair um doctor i i think we sort of share the goal um could you to could you talk about the importance of parents in terms of communicating oh with the children about uh about the dangers of tobacco mr kane i'm sorry um it's really important for tobacco to be talked about with kids one of the best ways to help a kid not use tobacco is to help a parent quit using tobacco if they're already using tobacco so some of the programs that you'll hear about prevention talk to parents about helping kids talk to their kids in ways that are effective so we should use lots of messages in different times we should talk in schools we should talk and meet you we should talk as parents thank you committee are there any further questions of this witness there being none thank you for being with us today thank you i'm going to really mess this up but when you get here corrected um sirose chair graves yes please come forward yes please you may sit there is there someone else like to join you that's fine thank you mark from boulder county okay please state your name and who you represent this is better my name is serge that's loud my name is sasha karis graves i am from golden i'm on golden city council and i'm here to represent the council thank you please proceed with your testimony thank you um golden is proud of the work we've done in the community to address tobacco use our community takes pride in being a destination for families wellness and health the 20 20 30 vision that we created together outlines our community values including a healthy sustainable community today and for those who follow our work to address tobacco use is consistent with these community values as we've identified in our golden vision 2030 plan we believe local communities and our local grantees should be allowed to address tobacco use at the local level without penalty our non-cigarette tobacco licensing has been highly successful it's a non-cigarette license to avoid the state's penalty for licensing cigarettes it's already incredible that the state penalizes a community for wanting to address the most deadly product we sell in the state and the bill before you wants to go even further and punish communities for addressing other tobacco products our reta our retailers have complied with our license system our recent compliance check found no violations and that perhaps that's because our penalties for selling to minors can include suspension and revocation of someone's ability to sell tobacco we've not had to utilize those penalties but as a community we decided that we wanted to have that option it's what we felt was appropriate for our community and for protecting our kids we should not be penalized for that our local amendment 35 grantees have provided valuable education and support for city council local control is an important part of colorado's history i also have a resolution to submit from our city council in opposition to house bill 1370 passed unanimously on april 14th i urge you to oppose house bill 1370 and the amendments that work to punish or restrict local activity to reduce death and disease from tobacco use thank you thank you for your testimony mr rusin yeah mark russin i am a senior policy analyst in the boulder county commissioner's office i appreciate the opportunity madam chair and committee members as well as to representative quorum and representative singer to testify here in opposition hb 1370 on behalf of the boulder county board of county commissioners and the boulder county board of health why do we care about hb 1370 according to the 2013 healthy kids colorado survey of boulder county high school students about 8 percent of boulder county high school students smoke cigarettes and about 66 percent tell us it would be sort of or very easy for them to get cigarettes and in fact in our two largest cities boulder and longmont tobacco retailers fail fda tobacco compliance checks involving youth sales about 12 percent of the time or one of every eight sales one one of every eight times they're checked we know that one of the primary ways we can help youth and young people avoid heart disease lung disease and cancer is to ensure that they either never start using tobacco or quit before tobacco addiction becomes too difficult to overcome boulder county is evidence that these practices work the very types of practices that amendment 5 is proposing to to limit according to that same healthy colorado healthy kids colorado survey that i mentioned previously in 2013 eight percent of boulder county high school students were smokers in 2003 that number was 22 10 years we've seen significant decline others here uh have already explained much better than i ever could why hb 1370 is flawed and you'll hear some more evidence in that regard i will suggest to you to you that is because of successes like we've seen here in boulder county that we here know clamoring from our constituents five thousands of seventy five thousand of which i will point out that our county commissioners share with representative singer uh for some kind of rollback or any kind of rollback and youth cessation efforts uh as those are being contemplated by hb 1370. thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for these witnesses representative rosenthal uh thank you madam chair i'm sorry uh the representative from golden i forgot your name um thank you for your testimony so um you said that you have very uh strong penalties for selling to minors and yet you know we've been told regularly before this uh hearing that there simply is not enough inspections and that um by the time an inspector gets around to inspecting another location it's past the two-year period therefore it's just a written warning and they never get a monetary warning they never get shut down they never get their license revoked um so i'm trying to sort of you know bring those two concepts together what's really happening out there ms graves thank you there is follow-up um we have had a compliance check there were no violations our um our retailers know that they're subject to these checks we haven't had to impose those penalties we hope we never have to but the education process appears to have been of benefit it appears to have helped them understand what they need to do and as f you know when i go in when others go in um there's no evidence that they're that they're not complying with um the licensing requirements thank you mr rudson yeah madam chair if i may also try to help i believe it's because the city of gold primarily because the city of golden actually has a licensure program the rest of us do not and that's why compliance is a much more difficult uh challenge in our communities committee are there any further questions of these witnesses there being none thank you both for being here today thank you jeff wilson please state your name and who you represent then you can proceed with your testimony thank you madam chairman members of the committee i'm jeff wilson i'm general counsel for the colorado municipal league first time before this committee this year better late than never um we uh have very strong opposition to the bill in its printed form in 1973 the some 70 municipalities made a deal with the general assembly in the tobacco industry to repeal our local tax ordinances regarding cigarettes in substitution for a state collected locally shared cigarette tax that's that deal has stood for 43 years and is embodied in the statutes the printed form of the bill proposed a violation of that agreement of breach and we of course uh would you know would recommend that we keep our word and keep our deals happily uh amendment l.005 removes all of the consideration and intrusion into the 1973 deal from the bill so our issues are resolved if l.005 is adopted i had detailed testimony about the 73 deal but with that amendment on the table i'll just cut it off at that thank you thank you for your testimony committee do you have any questions for this there being none thank you for being with us today chris bowie please state your names and who you represent no no there we go hi my name is dan sapienza and i'm here representing the health district in northern larimer county uh in opposition to this legislation uh in our county uh in 2015 during compliance checks one in eight miners that tried to purchase cigarettes was successful the state program right now just isn't working but local municipalities have shown as golden said earlier they've shown some really great opportunities uh to have licensure that does work and so we should be encouraging local municipalities to do whatever they can to prevent youth smoking and adopt local ordinances that work within their communities this bill undermines those local efforts and we oppose it i hope you vote no thank you thank you who'd like to testify next thank you please state your name and who you represent my name is chris bowie and i'm here on behalf of the colorado public health association i'm on the board of directors as the professional education and develop senior chair and our association represents public health professionals and students throughout colorado the colorado public health association strongly opposes house bill 1370 with proposed amendments spills detrimental to public health efforts to appropriately address the harms of underage sale possession and use of tobacco products local activities addressing public health related issues not just tobacco in colorado has been paramount to earning colorado's reputation as one of the healthiest states in the nation as such on behalf of colorado public health association please vote no on house bill 1370. thank you for your testimony please state your name and who you represent thank you madam chair my name is lisa van ramdunk i'm the executive director of the colorado association of local public health officials with the association for all the local health departments i'm here to share just a little slightly different information for you we do oppose this bill and the amendments 39 of our 54 public health agencies have board of health members who are only county commissioners at least five of our boards of health out of the 54 have city council persons who also sit on the board of health so what i'm telling you is that elected officials are the bosses of our local public health agencies so this bill restricts communication between local public health professionals and their bosses i think you know it's important to understand that your local public health staff are at the front lines of finding and tracking community problems community problems like lead in the water community problems like contagious disease and community problems like tobacco use in youth and the idea of this very very broad language sets a disastrous precedent where we control how our local public health agencies and how our local public health professionals are allowed to talk with their elected officials and their community leaders about the community problems in their community that's all i have for you thank you thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for these witnesses representative thurlow thank you madam chair uh thank all of you for being here i think my question is for mr sapienza if i've got that right and and possibly and i'm sorry i didn't ask it of mr wilson earlier but is is that part of the 1973 deal did that deal was part of the deal that communities wouldn't start their own licensing procedures and is that the heart of the problem is now communities are starting their own licensing procedures which it makes it harder for all of the stores that some of them are statewide they have to now adhere to multiple different standards in multiple different communities is that the crux of what we're talking about just happy ending excuse me thank you um i can't speak to the deal that was made in 1973 so perhaps the previous witness would have been a better choice there but in larimer county without any licensure required you know following these state rules um compliance is very low like i said in 2015 we had one in eight miners during compliance checks um so we need some solution and so our local municipalities are starting to look at this i believe and we're hoping they might put in some licensure requirements to reduce that number representative rosenthal thank you madam chair and anybody can i guess address this i guess as i i look at this amendment number five um which is causing me struggle because part of it i i think is probably a good idea the part about hiring more inspectors and yet the other part of it on line eight onwards um about barring this um ability for uh to for funding policy initiatives or advocacy efforts that causes me trouble so um if if let's just say and if we were to strike that part that said you know getting rid of the whole part about barring policy initiatives and stuff and just hiring a couple more inspectors since that seems to be the need out there as they need more more inspectors cut down on the number of places that are selling to miners would that be agreeable to you whoever would like to answer okay thank you thank you madam chair thank you representative um i'd have to look again i think there's two concerning parts especially concerning i should say um the first is the restricting communication and the second although i didn't mention it in my testimony is the idea of legislating evidence-based i think the whole purpose of evidence-based is that we're continuing to build what that means and so putting what is and is not evidence-based and what in statute seems to be against that we're always learning representative thank you so i uh my understanding is is that that this is not suggesting um and i could be wrong that you don't use evidence based programs it's not suggesting that you don't communicate but that it is suggesting that we don't use these dollars for policy initiatives or advocacy efforts my understanding is is that amendment 35 dollars were passed by the citizens for designated for health care services and tobacco education to improve the health of all coloradans i'm quoting that from the cdphe website so how does using these dollars i'm not saying other dollars you have but using these dollars amendment 35 dollars for policy initiatives and advocacy efforts meet the um uh the revenue designation that was that the citizens voted for mr bowie thank you madam chair so a lot of this these monies go toward policy work in general it can look many different ways it goes organizational it can go through kind of other policies for i'll use local colleges or community college campuses it can be campus work there's there's different ways that we are able to provide materials and education efforts and provide the right kind of engagement with our with our with our people i wouldn't say that it's just aimed and tailored we don't specifically go out and say that we're targeting elected officials we're going out and we're doing what public health goals are are supposed to do and it's to educate the public and it happens that we have people that are elected officials or part of governing bodies or are at home and it just ranges from everybody so we we are aiming to educate thank you committee are there any further questions from this set of witnesses there being none thank you for being with us today rick ritter thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent absolutely thank you so much committee for taking time out of your busy schedules to hear my testimony my name is rick ritter i'm representing alexander matthew curie and nathaniel my four kiddos and i'm also here as a public health employee representing public health my family's previous experience with tobacco underscores the reason i'm so passionate about tobacco control and really making sure children do not start using it my father died a very lingering death from metastatic lung cancer my mom died a very quick death from congestive heart failure and they initiated tobacco use my mom was 13. my dad was 15. there simply weren't good protective measures in place back then and representative you said it's important for parents to talk to their kids absolutely but i believe it takes a village to raise a child and i think we need to come together united as both parents individuals and government to protect our most valuable resource our children as a public health professional there's a number of troubling uh issues in this bill i'd like to just share one with you it significantly weakens the consequences for illegally selling to minors my agency worked hand in hand with the city of rocky ford a couple years ago to pass a non-cigarette tobacco license that is working captain angelo griego will talk to that he's the one in the trenches doing it he's going to come after me it has revocation and suspension provisions it means business if you sell to kids and get them to start smoking we're going to have some teeth we can pull your license i think there's six dor representatives in the state that does compliance now and that is far far too few those joining me in opposition to hp 1370 include the crowley board of county commissioners the otero board of county commissioners our local board of health and the city of rocky ford as i mentioned that success the community came together and passed a non-cigarette tobacco license that was a community's decision i'm all about local control we need to be as strict as a state but can we be stricter yes and if a community wants to go that extra step to protect the youth they should be allowed to do it two seconds thank you for your testimony mr ritter thank you committee are there any questions for this witness i just want to say welcome to the state capitol and thank you for being so passionate and representing otero county i appreciate you very much thank you representative thank you for your testimony thank you and you have to be back on the floor at 5 30. 6 30 you've got a tough job thank you for representing us well and that is 5 30 committee angela angelo griego hello thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent sure thing my name is angelo grigo i'm captain for the rocky ford police department i'm here to talk to you in opposition of this bill again thank you for your time on 9 9 2014 the city of rocky ford was progressive in protecting their youth by passing ordinances 901 and 902 now these ordinances in conjunction with current cigarette laws made it tougher for tobacco companies to push their products through advertising advertising and self-service display to any youth entering a store where non-secret tobacco products are sold just as important as the ordinances themselves is the enforcement of these ordinances as outlined in the ordinances the rocky ford police department conducts two compliance checks within a one-year period by allowing municipal municipalities the opportunity to create policy and the ordinances which directly impact their citizens and in this case their youth allows city government the opportunity to regulate the vendors who choose to violate tobacco laws now if this bill passes the youth in our cities are at the mercy of the department of revenue no res no disrespect but because they are understaffed and do not have the time to conduct these laws on a regular basis whereas the city of rocky ford is currently able to do this successfully lastly well i have some other things but because of a two-minute time constraint lastly if this bill does pass the city of rocky ford knows that they could gain annual rev potential increase in funds however we've contemplated is that mountain is that amount of money worth the risk of one youth in our communities to be subjected to the most destructive and addictive substance sold in our stores because the rocky ford police department and the city government has worked diligently to protect our youth from nicotine and tobacco products we say it's not worth it so i ask you please take into consideration help our citizens and our youth and vote no on this bill thank you for your testimony if if i may um mr rosenthal had a couple questions um that i might be able to answer for him in regards to inspections please proceed thank you um mr rosenthal i'm sorry representative rosenthal okay okay you had you were asking about compliance checks and frequency i can tell you in the city of rocky ford in our area the last time uh the department of revenue was down was only because of a complaint um so they decided to come down prior to that the last time they had come down was in 2011. the last time was in 2014 and again in 2015 prior to that they hadn't been down so here we're talking about compliance checks where us the city of rocky ford the people on my team are able to do biannual and that's just a bare minimum buy annual compliance checks whereas the department of revenue does this over a certain period of time with six people on their team for the whole state of colorado i don't know i hope maybe that answered your question a little bit more did i answer all your questions representative rosenthal thank you all right committee are there any further questions of this witness there being none thank you for being with us today jody redke thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent my name is jody bradke and i am the regional director with the campaign for tobacco free kids and good afternoon madam chair members of the committee i'm rj hours with the american cancer society cancer action network and i'm a member also of the colorado tobacco control alliance and here on behalf of both those groups on behalf of acs can and the alliance are i want to express our opposition to house bill 1370 and all proposed amendments uh we are very supportive of legislation seeking to improve or to remove impediments to effective local public health efforts particularly when it comes to the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products unfortunately house bill 1370 falls woefully short of that objective and in point of fact would harm progress already achieved in a half a dozen colorado communities who now have comprehensive licensing for the sale of tobacco products other than cigarettes in fact house bill 1370 represents about the fourth time in the past 43 years that big tobacco and its surrogate organizations have sought to blunt or undermine local control of a public health matter such as youth tobacco prevention indeed these grassroots efforts in local communities and the awareness of tobacco control issues build community support and foster informed discourse about the need for a change in public health norms i'm going to turn over discussion now to my colleague jody who will go into more detail about some of the work that the tobacco industry and its surrogates do madam chair may i distribute a document prior to my testimony with the clerk for distribution yes thank you thank you and while she's coming to um get that i would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to relay our opposition to this bill to house bill 1370. if this bill is truly concerning the regulation of nicotine product retailers end quote as the title suggests then the bill would do just that it would regulate retail sales questioning the effectiveness of colorado's state tobacco prevention and cessation program and redirecting funding is a distraction from the bill that was originally drafted we see these distractions nationwide when legislation is being considered at the state level that appears to effectively reduce tobacco use the document that's being distributed for your review and consideration i won't walk you through it in its entirety but these are tactics that are outlined in the tobacco industries quote policy plan these are documents available as part of the master settlement agreement and requirement for full disclosure of their policy plans and documents and work within our state legislatures these policy this policy plan includes four tactics i think a couple of those are relevant for today's discussion one of which is to diminish anti-tobacco funding you'll see it on page five the third strategy of those four tactics under diminished funding the three that i think are applicable today and the way they employ that strategy is to to do the following three things one is to challenge anti-tobacco programs through oversight agencies and an auditing procedure secondly to create the illusion that public funds under our state programs are being used for lobbying when indeed they are not and the third is to work with friendly legislators to hold hearings on the efficacy of these programs and quote arm them with evidence of waste abuse and efficacy of our programs these tactics and strategies are employed to divert the attention from our state legislatures from what we and they know is effective which is a comprehensive licensing program that creates actual accountability we urge you to vote no as amended and as originally drafted this bill undermines our cities our counties our towns and the state tobacco program that was approved by colorado's voter voters and further harms colorado's kids we appreciate you for your testimony you're welcome camille are there any questions of these witnesses there being we appreciate you being here today thank you madam chair jill bednarek please state your name and who you represent good afternoon madam chair my name is jill bednerick i represent the colorado department of public health and environment i work in the tobacco program please proceed with your testimony thank you before i begin i want to remind all of us that every single one of us in this room knows someone who as a teenager started smoking and later developed a debilitating illness or died young from that please keep that person in mind as you consider this bill this bill and all of its iterations are designed to cause alarm and doubt about the public health approach it even goes so far as to propose to put false statements in state statute about the scientific evidence base the bill is designed to allow retailers who violate the law to continue to illegally sail to minors rather than hold law breaking retailers accountable the bill goes after municipalities and health entities that want to protect their kids we know how to prevent youth from starting smoking we have clear evidence about what does work and we also know what doesn't work you have heard examples from golden and rocky ford communities that have with our grantees have worked together to pass local retail licensing and you've heard from them that those programs have been successful we also know that licensing is a strong recommended strategy endorsed by multiple entities in public health we also know that the voters who approve these funds told the state of colorado that colorado should deter children and youth from starting to smoke and direct the funds be spent for community-based programs designed to reduce initiation of tobacco and use by children and youth so as stewards of these funds we are very careful to abide by the requirements in state statutes and voter intent by funding what works grantees are re the what they are doing has been mischaracterized and also taken out of context we know we also tell grantees what they cannot spend funds on they cannot do school assemblies they cannot do pig lug demonstrations things thank you for your testimony thank you ma'am committee are there any questions of this witness there are none thank you for being here today chris house and i would like for you to testify on how you would like to present yourself for the bill [Laughter] we're taking a little shift here excellent please state your name and who you represent madam chair my name is chris howes i'm the president of the colorado retail council members thank you for listening to my quick testimony today we are in favor of the bill as it was written and we are also in favor of the bill as it will be amended through zero zero five we represent um hundreds of large chain grocery stores that sell this product um and as i understand it as um the representative from the minneso league said this was a deal in 1973 to govern the sale of cigarettes what we're talking about what you've heard for the last half hour is otp other than tobacco other tobacco products not cigarettes so when you hear witnesses talking about smoking this is actually not about smoking this is about other tobacco products such as chew or dip or what have you and these local governments are passing licensing programs on otp so just to clarify what you're you're voting on today this is about other tobacco products being licensed at the local level we are in support of the amendment and hope you vote yes politics is the art of compromise this is really shooting right down the middle isn't it one side gets one thing more inspections the other side gets something else we believe those uh amendment 35 dollars are being used for lobbying thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for this witness there being none thank you for being here today thank you for listening mary lou chapman thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent thank you madam chairman members of the committee my name is mary lou chapman i'm the president of rocky mountain food industry association my members are are your local grocery stores throughout the various counties of this of the state our retailers take the sale of all tobacco products very seriously and we're very um supportive of this bill as mr house said both the original bill and the bill that that um you will find it amended to uh to be anyway the state show most of the stats show that overall colorado retailers are doing a very good job on compliance our store owners are also parents grandparents aunts and uncles of miners so they work very diligently with their employees to control the sale of all age restricted products because it's the right thing to do not because of penalties our retailer's view on the core issue here is pretty simple we don't believe any government agency or entity should allow our customers or their businesses tax dollars to be used to attempt to coerce or lobby other government agencies to further hassle or regulate our retailers who are already taking the necessary necessary steps to ensure compliance thank you for your testimony committee are there any questions for this witness there being none thank you for being here today thank you greer bailey thank you for being here today please state your name and who you represent uh greg bailey i'm the executive director of the colorado petroleum marketers association um apparently i caused kind of a problem here um the uh so we got the retail community to introduce a bill that would uh double sales and minor penalties give uh yeah the good guys over the department of revenue more resources for enforcement um uh and that's probably not a good thing um i guess the uh the i don't understand how 12 million dollars is a penalty to that you guys give every year to local governments not to muck up uniformity consistency for the retail community i don't understand that um the lobbying prohibition is is limited in the amendment to taxes licenses and fees on business then go talk to them about whatever else they want um you know these you know this deal has been around for a while and it wasn't until about 2011 2012 that these local licenses started popping up and it was because the department of health gave start giving these these grant dollars these local public health organizations to try and go get these city councils to do it before that these licenses didn't exist so why the retailers were running a bill that would have increased enforcement uh doubled sales and minor penalties uh for the first time ever let the department know where everybody is all things that probably arguably are good for tobacco control um is because they're giving six million dollars to 27 local public health organizations to go out and to do this you know i am going to challenge the efficacy of the of the program because if you're giving six million dollars to to impose a 100 license on 5 000 or so retailers you're going to get a return of 500 000 thank you for your testimony mr greer committee are there any questions from mr greer representative rupe thank you madam chair and thank you mr bailey for being here earlier i heard someone say that this bill is really penalizing the ones that are following the law and missing the ones that are not following the law can you maybe answer some of that um concern mr bailey well thank you and thank you for the question um i i you know according to the department of revenue's website retailers are between 92 and 96 compliant that shifts every year a little bit and so really what these licenses do is impose a you know 150 license on generally 92 out of 100 retailers that are doing the right thing um the retailers think that's the wrong way to go if you really want to increase enforcement you or you really want to um increa you know or go after bad actors you increase enforcement dollars you know i i'm you know i appreciate that the efforts of the local the local community to address that but the math problem for these local for these local communities i mean you take a town like fountain who passed one of these ordinances you know they've got eight or nine gas stations call it four do things in that ordinance that doesn't exist in colorado things like population control based licensing i mean we heard from our liquor store friends a little bit earlier and you know what if these licenses eventually evolve into something like that then you're devaluing the existing businesses that the people my association have uh invested in and um you know you put things like population control you say that if you're a primary tobacco retailer you're not allowed to be in business you know that's that's tough for existing retailers um and finally this is this is not a big tobacco bill this is a retailer's bill i don't i don't work for them i i work for the retailers um the uh i'm not sure what it surrogate really means but i i i'm the executive director of patrolling marketers and i'm trying to defer five hundred thousand dollars in unnecessary fees on a fairly compliant industry that's that's the purpose and i'm trying to trade more statewide enforcement that's kind of what the bill is supposed to be about thank you committee are there any further questions of our witness there being none thank you for being with us today mary serge mark thank you for being with us today please state your name and who you represent for the record thank you my name is mary zarmak i'm the uh with smoker friendly and gas mat a locally owned business out of boulder and good evening committee evening really come on so i'm here i think i'm the last though so i'll be quick and and succinct i think a lot of things have been said that need to be said so as i said i'm mary zara mack i'm the vice president of trade marketing and government relations for a third generation boulder-based company gas and mountain smoker friendly we're a colorado company that owns 102 stores and 55 of them are here in the state we pride ourselves in reinvesting in our company our communities and our state like many family businesses we have made sacrifices to make our company a success and be good employers in this state and others we're the largest one of the largest family owned employers in the state of colorado we're in the top 10 and we are the largest family-owned employer in our uh county in boulder county our industry as a whole remitted over 325 million dollars to the state of colorado last year in taxes for the last several years i've come down here to the capitol to try and be engaged and educate our legislature about our industry and about the fact that we are responsible retailers and take pride in the way that we do business somehow it seems that the public feels that every child that ever smokes is the responsibility of an irresponsible retailer that wants to profit from selling to a minor no business owners i know think that and in fact i just sat in a meeting with uh director mitch zeller from the fda center for tobacco tobacco product kid center for tobacco products at the fda last week and they reported that 86 of miners that smoke get cigarettes and other tobacco products from social sword sources which means they're not getting them from retail outlets and that's nationwide also in the state of colorado the fda had a 98 percent pass rate in their minor checks uh i think greer mentioned 92 to 96 that's on the state level and we have a 100 passage rate in both larimer and boulder counties by the way for both of my friends from my counties thank you for your testimony you're welcome committee are there any questions of this witness there are no thank you for being here today okay thank you committee that ends our witness testimony phase we do have mr patrick moroney here with the liquor and tobacco enforcement for questions would any of you like to bring up mr maroney okay is there anyone else in the audience who would like to testify on house bill 16 1370. there being none the witness testimony phase is now closed representative quorum we do have we do have our amendment in front of us and someone on the committee would like to remove that representative rosenthal thank you thank you madam chair actually i have a question for you procedural before we do that and i want to make sure that i don't have a settled question i do want to sever part of that amendment would that be done after that the amendment is proposed representative rosenthal would like to go ahead and and have a motion to move l005 let the sponsor speak to it and then we will discuss um how you would like to sever the bill and then make a ruling then does anyone want to move l005 there being none the chair will move l005 l05 has been moved by the chair and second by the vice chair representative quorum did you want to speak to this a little bit more well i i would just like to say that i think um you know as never being a smoker it uh makes about as much sense of me running this bill as as i did the iud bill last year but that seemed to be successful so we'll try this one but um uh i i think what we're i'm really concerned about and i'm going to go back to the audit uh auditor's request in 2012. and i have the copies of all the the formal ag opinions and to my knowledge um they didn't provide me that opinion on this case and i'm concerned that you know four years later we have a state auditor requesting information and it hasn't been done uh so i i think that is very concerning to me i think also the the fact that uh i think enforcement is probably the key to this um and i really believe that that is important and um i truly do question um whether we'd be money putting money better to use doing enforcement or doing lobbying and i think that is the main issue that we're trying to do in this amendment and uh with that i would ask you for yes vote representative garnett thank you madam chair and representative quorum does l005 narrow the title representative quorum you know i i i think it it it might i'm not sure i think there's i i'm not sure what uh representative rosenthal is wishing to sever um so i guess that was that was something i would be interested in also representative krantharp thank you representative quorum representative singer for bringing us this bill and for bringing us the amendments i don't disagree with the programming and the good work that people that um people in the community are doing mark johnson and jeffco uh health probably does the best of any of you so i just put that on the record because he is my jeffco health department and i am his biggest fan absolutely support all of the efforts this is my concern is that in 2004 the colorado voters approved amendment 35 a tax increase on cigarettes and other tobacco products the revenue was designated for health care services and tobacco education to improve the health of all coloradans that's from the cdphe uh website in 2012 the auditor questioned the use of the the dollars in terms of policy and advocacy and recommended made a recommendation that the ag issue an opinion around whether the dollars that the citizens voted in were correct the cdphe refused to follow through on that i found uh i came across this concern not seeing any of this other stuff brought it up to cdphe who told me you don't like it run legislation so i'm glad that um that you are doing this thank you very much so for that reason i worked in i'll be i'll be done for i have worked in non-profits all my life i get the concept that certain dollars should not be used for lobbying lobbying ma'am is not communication lobbying is is a totally different activity certain dollars should not be used for lobbying i believe that amendment 35 according to the purpose that the citizens voted in those dollars should not be used for lobbying and advocacy i'm a strong yes on this thank you representative rosenthal thank you ma'am sure is this the proper time to speak to severing part of this amendment representative rosenthal we had a conversation with the drafter and it's going to be very very complicated to sever this amendment and so the chair rules that we will not sever the amendment are there any objections to l zero zero five miss altman will you please take the role representatives aren't yes garnett no navarro yes nordberg yes pass rosenthal no rupe yes science yes thurlow yes winter yes west yes babone yes craft art yes madam chair no okay that amendment passes ten to three sponsors do you have any more amendments i do not committee are there any amendments the amendment phase is now closed sponsors would you like to make any closing comments um i would like to repeat what uh representative kraft larp said i think that's uh i think that's the basis of the bill um you know i think it's uh when we as legislators ask for information and departments deny that information i think it's up to us to get that information so i think what we're doing here is moving in the right direction and hopefully we will get the information we will also be adding more inspectors which i think is key uh rather than using money for lobbying thank you representative craftharp thank you madam chair i move house bill 16 1370 as amended to finance sorry um with favorable recommendation finance no physical note no i don't know it says it on my piece of paper do we have a second finance plan house bill 16 1370 has been moved to the committee on finance with a favorable recommendation as amended by representative kraft thorpe do we have a second by representative rosenthal is that correct no second representative nordberg ms altman will you i want to say a few words oh representative rosenthal has some closing comments thank you madam chair and you know i i wanted to sever this amendment because i i like half the bill and i don't like the other half uh the part that i don't like is the part that's banning the speech by uh public health groups to be able to make sure that we're enacting good policy at the local level and and that's the part that i wanted to eliminate uh the part that i did like is the part about um getting more inspectors which is we hear from everybody we need more inspectors therefore i wanted to support that part of the bill so since um but it has that poison pill the the first part that i mentioned so i'll be voting no any more closing comments ms altman will you please take the roll call representatives aren't no garnett no borrow no nordberg rosenthal no repay pass dice madam chair respectfully now and that bill fails 2 to 11. thank you gentlemen for coming before the yes representative navarro i

KN6clFDDI2g,02-17-2016,3362,CO,representatives aren't yes danielson yes klingon schmidt no navarro no ransom rosenthal yes sane respectfully no singer yes they're alone yes lebsock yes madam chair yes congratulations that bill's passes seven four it's on its way to appropriations thank you next up we have house bill 1150 representative conte please come forward and tell us about house bill 1150 i mean sort of a goofy bill and it could become just that transparency welcome to local government welcome back to local government thank you madam chair it's nice to be with you today sure thank you madam chair it's a delightful to be with you today madam chair and members of the local government committee it is my pleasure to be with you and to bring before you hospital 1150. this is a measure brought forward by the county governments across colorado it is a very simple bill that simply tweaks existing state statutes regarding restrictions on minors possessing and using tobacco on delivery services back in 2008 the general assembly passed the teen tobacco use prevention act the act empowers local governments to restrict the sale of tobacco products to minors and is a very important legislative tool for protecting our young people the act was amended several years ago to update the definition of tobacco delivery services to include e-cigarettes and vaporizers often called e-cigs and vapes unfortunately when the changes were made they were not cross-referenced in the sections of the statute that contain county regulatory authority to adopt and enforce ordinances regarding possession and use by minors the bill before you today explicitly links those updated definitions to the county regulatory authority and makes it clear that counties can also prohibit the and possession of these e-cigarettes and vapes as well as cities this bill also extends to counties the same level of ordinance-making authority enjoyed by cities and allows not demands allows counties to adopt and enforce penalties and by that i mean fines simply finds we have a few witnesses today who can provide a little bit more background on some of the legal rationale and for these necessary changes thank you madam chair thank you representative conte um so question for you and maybe you or potentially some of the other witnesses will be able to uh address this what are some of the best practices that you're trying to bring to the fore here um allowing you know the counties to adopt legislation that would penalize youth for possession of you know tobacco products and is that somewhere where around the country where this has been effective and we're just going to bring it here to colorado do you have any data on that thank you madam chair uh yes uh representative uh rosenthal there is going to be much data that's going to be presented to you today uh we're simply this this bill was brought forth by the county government cci and in unanimous fashion i can tell you that they but the county that brought it forward has one of the largest metropolises that is unincorporated into city boundaries and that is a small little town that we know is highlands ranch uh and so they are in a situation where they had just an uh an explosion of these kind of in inferences happening on some of their high school campuses uh with the with these kids uh what would happen is the schools would impose their style of penalties and that is detentions suspensions expulsions but obviously you know when they don't show up for detention and they're forced into something harsher the only tool in their toolbox is to kick the kid out of school this is probably counterproductive and so they are coming to the law enforcement saying can you help us out can you do anything and the law enforcement at the county level because they're not incorporated into a city is saying no we really can't we don't have the purview so they are going to their county commissioners saying can you help us out and the county commissioners are then coming to us thank you madam chair um thanks i look forward to seeing some of that data and um and then one final question so do you know of any municipalities in colorado that uh utilize the current statute allowing them to do this and uh and maybe perhaps if they are then you know having some feedback about those and if they are not why are they not adopting this kind of ordinance uh granting themselves power to to penalize these kids thank you madam chair i can tell you honestly uh rep rosenthal that i have not uh had any contact with cml on this to know if there is any kind of city that is enacting this and and again this is not a a mandate this is simply permissive that they can so i really do not know if anyone has chosen to enact any ordinances within city boundaries or not and what the data is there might be some witnesses who know more about that than i do and i do apologize for that representative thank you madam chair representative conti i i certainly share the idea that that children shouldn't be um partaking in in nicotine products i i get that um one thing that thank you um for that question did you want to respond representative thank you madam chair and and uh i i can just my response would simply say this bill is simply permissive it allows local county commissioners to go where they want to go so lobby your county commissioner uh and uh and and make sure that you make your best practices known as you understand it to them so that they can take that to heart when they are enacting the ordinances that they would enact within their own county it does not prescribe anything that they have to do it simply is permissive and leaves it to their good judgment representative thank you madam chair and i'm i'm looking in 1813 121 to see it is there a state law is there an existing state law that that prohibits the possession of nicotine representative conti i am calling on a lifeline here and and i am told that it that yes there is and it's probably called tobacco products represent sorry could you repeat that represent left side i'm looking for the the exact statute but i believe there is a state law that um prohibits minors from possessing nicotine and i guess this is my next step is that if we already have a law on the books then why do we why do we need to add this one because the counties can just enforce the current state law i mean i'm just asking that question we have we have a county attorney who will come up and i'm sure shed some light beyond what i am able to do represent art thank you madam chair so uh my professional background is in special education high school teacher uh students with learning disabilities behavior disorders mental handicaps um no amount of detention never stopped a kid from smoking and i'm wondering how giving them a ticket would because what i'm concerned about is kids smoking not punishing them how would this bill help that or hurt that representative madam chair um i would simply again defer to witnesses that we have coming up from the counties who have directly and expressly requested this and i think they can share with you better light on why they're asking for it and how they think that it will help that would help me as well because representative singer was talking about when you find someone it gets their attention and i represent a demographic where the teens and the families may not have money or fine and if it is a team the person that ends up having to pay it might be that parent and i know that you're saying that the counties would determine um how much that fine would be but i do have issues with just the the whole finding in that form of punishment i don't know if that really gets someone's attention that may not be the only issue that they're confronted with they may have summons or tickets for other kinds of things so i do have some concerns about that thank you madam chair i i certainly understand and share your concerns i can tell you that uh one of the things that gave me a little bit more comfort is that it's now the county's asking for this and if you think about it all along the way these officials are going to stand and be accountable to the public both your county commissioners who would set the ordinances and your county sheriffs who are acting and carrying out uh the ordinances that they are given the purview to do and so your sheriff will stand election if there's abuses or there's over over stiff penalties that are burdensome they will stand in account as well as your county commissioners and so i can tell you that that is the check and balance uh that i feel is in this bill as opposed to the previous statute that simply gave cities that have police departments where your chiefs of police are appointed and they do not have to answer to the public so this is a a good check that i feel the county government's offer that was not is not available in current law as it stands for cities okay are we ready for witness testimony we have folks who have signed up for or against do you have a preference take those opposed first okay let's see i'm going to bring up then let's see 444 against it looks like um denise myers is she still here yep please come forward i am thank you very much welcome to local government thank you um madam chair members of the committee my name is denise mayes i'm the public policy director for the aclu of colorado and i am here in opposition to this bill um some of the questions i think that were raised by some of the committee members actually do highlight some of our concerns about the bill but i'll start first with why in the first instance the bill is troubling the aclu has investigated over the years what we call the overuse and frankly the abuse of fines and fees by cities and counties and i think as madam chair raised these fines and fees tend to add up and they're not small and as you heard from the sponsor of the bill representative conte there is no there is no uh ceiling on the amount of fines that counties can create and the fines can simply mount up and i also think that these sorts of fines and fees have a tendency to disproportionately impact uh certain communities and clearly those of limited means um and so um i think that uh we are even though we might feel comfortable with the fact that it's not a per se crime um certainly enough fines and fees can can really burden a particular family and so even at that front i think it's it's problematic definitely on that front the second thing is i'm i'm also baffled by the rationale that was provided for this bill the notion that counties and or schools cannot currently do anything about this particular issue of pervasive nicotine products i i find that to be completely false and maybe i'm missing something and but right now state law makes possession by minors um uh unlawful and and i mean it's uh 1813 121 uh parent to parent little a that basically says that a person who is under 18 years of age and who purchases or attempts to purchase any cigarettes tobacco products or nicotine products commits a class two petty offense and upon conviction shall be finished by a fine of a hundred dollars now interestingly enough there are some guard rails here it says only a hundred dollars there's ways that you can pay off the fine that are not just by pure dollars but you can do a tobacco education program for example so in this instance i think that we have even nicotine products are covered by state law i am aware i am not aware of any law that prohibits a county from enforcing a state law so i don't understand why this isn't sufficient the second thing i'll note is that um possession of tobacco and tobacco products is not permitted in schools and so there's already a vehicle to address this issue whether it be within the classroom itself or on school grounds so what i really see here is the potential to simply pile on you have a state law you have a city law and now you'll have a county law and really you could be fined in all three instances so not only is the fine or fee hundred dollars it's whatever the city now adds and what the county may add and let me give you an example of what douglas county has done and just as just one example they have a an ordinance that prohibits violating a certain curfew well that fine is not only allocated to the individual the teenager who is committing the curfew violation but they also make the parents subject to the fine as well so now you have a double hit in the family for one offense so i think that these sorts of things and this is why i talk about i talk a lot at the aclu about how these particular fines and fees frankly can be abused and i just don't see a very solid rationale to support this bill and that's why i asked for a no vote thank you representative thank you madam chair thank you miss mace so um how does this practically work let's just say um you know under current law current practice you said that uh tobacco products are not allowed in schools and so let's say you know a school you know security officer comes and sees a kid with you know pack of cigarettes says hey can i have those cigarettes um you should not be having those um the kid says no i mean or even says yes i mean what is the enforcement there the kid could just say fine take you know take it out of my my cold dead hands and what is it whether the officer can have a scuffle with a kid i mean i i you know kids are pretty you know strong-headed so what what's the process there of how to work with kids who you know want to hold on to their tobacco miss myers thank you madam chair uh representative rosenthal you know i was such an agreeable kid it's hard for me to really envision that particular scenario but um but you know i went to catholic schools but um anyhow i think it's just like any other transgression that a child commits in school i mean unfortunately some schools don't deal with this very well they deal with it through the criminal justice system which is obviously unfortunate but i think that there's a better way to deal with it within the school dynamic itself whether it's um let's call your parents in let's talk about what's going on let's i mean i think you can ratchet up whether it comes to you know half a day of of sitting in a suspension hall reading on all the ills of tobacco i mean there are lots of ways that schools can wrestle all kinds of problems that happen on an everyday basis that don't involve a punitive approach um like i think will likely occur uh through this through this particular bill represent singer did you still have a question yeah uh thank you madam chair um i have a couple questions but i'm just going to limit it to one right now i think um in terms of the concern about this issue specifically are you aware of cities that have put in onerous um fines or penalty structures for minors that you know really hasn't lent itself to a better public health outcome miss myers thank you madam chair i'm not entirely certain that i understand your question representative singer um because i think i heard two double negatives but um but i what i i've been in the legislature i've been in the legislature for a while now that's my fault yeah i don't know about not not having to no i'm just kidding um i i honestly am not aware of a lot of municipalities that have these particular laws that aren't both city and county for example in denver um and and then secondly i think that um that the jury so to speak would still be out on whether or not there's an educational benefit to it i think what the state does uh as i mentioned um earlier in my testimony that that there's ways even to work off the hundred dollar fine in the state law where you can actually go to a tobacco education class which seems uh hopefully to get the job done better than having a particular punitive approach further questions seeing none thank you for your testimony today um thank you thank you representative conte has a bill in another committee that's why she's not at the table but she has requested that we proceed with the uh testimony so i'm gonna call up the next uh witness here and it looks like this rj and can't read the writing owens ours owls please come forward ours okay o-u-r-s thank you madam chair good afternoon madam chair and members of the committee my name is rj hours and i'm the colorado director of government relations with the american cancer society cancer action network which we call acs can for short here in denver i'm here today representing acs can and on behalf of fellow members of the colorado tobacco-free alliance including the american heart association the american lung association the campaign for tobacco-free kids and the colorado group to alleviate smoking pollution i want to thank representative conte as well as colorado counties and the sheriffs for their concern about youth and the use of cigarettes and other tobacco products including e-cigarettes acs can and the heart association the lung association ctfk and colorado gasp are very concerned about the increase in the marketing sales and use of e-cigarettes in colorado however our alliance partners do not support house bill 1150 as introduced we actually oppose the passage of the measures in 2008 that had been referred to earlier uh criminalizing youth possession of cigarettes and tobacco products so we we believe we need to be consistent here and and not support the extension of something we previously opposed uh so we we don't support that expansion uh of of the language from that time we believe the culpability and penalties related to youth tobacco use should be focused on those who sell or provide tobacco products to underage youth and not the young people who have been enticed to try or buy tobacco products additionally we do not support the use of the term nicotine products in legislation to denote the products of concern by defining them separately and then in a more seemingly innocuous way we believe it diminishes the importance of regulating all tobacco and tobacco derived products and they're and there are non-nicotine smokeless products and non-nicotine electronic smoking devices on the market now that may not be included by the language in this legislation since the introduction of e-cigarettes to the u s market around eight years ago the marketing and use of these products have increased markedly specifically regarding youth a study from the centers for disease control and prevention found that e-cigarettes were the most used tobacco product among youth in 2014 increasing from 1.5 percent to 13.4 percent of high school students reporting current use between 2011 and 2014 with similar trends in middle school students a growing number of studies have examined the contents of e-cigarette aerosol unlike a vapor an aerosol contains fine particles of liquid solid or both propylene glycol nicotine and flavorings were most commonly found in e-cigarettes aerosols other studies have found the aerosol to contain heavy metals volatile organic compounds and tobacco-specific nitrosamines among the potentially harmful chemicals and a 2009 study done by the fda found cancer-causing substances in several e-cigarette samples tested and additionally the food and drug administration tests found nicotine in some e-cigarettes that claim to contain no nicotine the health effects of e-cigarettes are currently under study and there are still serious questions about the safety of inhaling the substances in e-cigarette aerosol while e-cigarette manufacturers may claim the ingredients are just water vapor or safe without federal regulation and analysis there's no sure way for e-cigarette users to know what they are consuming nor is there any way of knowing what non-users are exposed to and the extent of the health risk to them additionally there are hundreds of other types of e-cigarettes on the market today and products vary considerably by ingredients and quality control assurance on behalf of acs can and our tobacco control alliance i want to sincerely thank again representative conte for her concern about the use of cigarettes and tobacco products by young people here in colorado we deeply appreciate her bringing this important issue to the table thank you all for your discussion here today and for this opportunity to speak thank you madam chair and i'm happy to take any questions thank you mr hours representative singer thank you madam chair and thank you mr alex for being here and also representing a coalition of people as opposed to having each of those members come up and testified so you saved me the time for asking this question six times uh what i'm curious about is so if you said that the the use of of e-cigarettes is is jumping even though it looks like overall tobacco uses is you know still down um but it sounds like almost a ten-fold increase in e-cigarette use by miners which is you know i think everyone here is worried about that ah to a certain extent whatever public health or legal framework that we've put in place today isn't doing its job if that's where the jump is now it could be any number of things that that we haven't gone and mounted a good enough public information campaign um from e-cigarettes or from from uh uh you know old tobacco products to to e-cigarettes um but i guess my question is if this isn't the answer and the status quo isn't the answer what what should cities and counties in the state be doing to work directly with youth with the you know individuals that are that are making these decisions independent of their parents independent of of the school system obviously independent of me mr hours thank you madam chair representative singer uh we believe strongly and i i sort of alluded to it my comments but there's so much more that can be done to adequately enforce the legal sale of all tobacco products including e-cigarettes we have no state license licensing system in colorado we have very little in the way of penalties i do believe that that the authorities do enforce and inspect and and uh to the best their abilities but but to to our minds there just aren't yet the resources adequately in place to enable especially local enforcement of tobacco retail sales and that's something we advocated here for last year to enable because we believe in local control for public health and that's something we advocated very hard for last year to allow these same local communities we're talking about today cities municipalities and counties to pass their own ordinances levy their own sanctions uh to to those tobacco uh sellers when they transgress all right president singer thanks no i'll leave it at that right now representative thank you um madam chair so mr hours you know sort of relay across the country what are some of the programs of um you know where you do have instances of municipalities adopting uh these kinds of you know punitive measures and you know what's been the result of some of those do you have any of that information or data mr owls thank you madam chair uh representative rosenthal i i do not have national information as it relates to current state law enabling local communities cities and municipalities to have their own ordinances in place that can reflect or go further than the state law only woodland park i am told has in the last eight years availed themselves to that opportunity and to what uh degree to what um result i i'm not aware we we were not asked to be uh engaged in that effort at the time uh which we wouldn't have supported but we were not contacted mr alex can you speak then to um maybe what the awareness efforts are taking place to um prevent these products from getting in the kids hands because i know that we're talking about finding which is punitive but i'm more interested in not that aspect but i'd like to hear more about one of the intervention strategies that we're using to address the healthcare aspects as it relates to nicotine products thank you madam chair specifically i don't have a lot of detail but generally i know that there are parts of the health department's tobacco control efforts that are aimed at prevention and youth education we're lucky here in colorado to have the benefit of of resources from the amendment 35 tobacco taxes each year that go into these educational programs we have monies available for our our great colorado quit line program to help adults especially quit smoking so there are resources available we're not at the threshold yet that the cdc prescribes uh for funding of tobacco control programs so there probably is more we could do if we had the resources but i i believe we are making the best use of what we have right now thank you representative lebson thank you madam chair um thank you mr hours for your testimony you made it clear um in your prepared remarks that the american cancer society is opposed to this bill but you also mentioned that the tobacco control alliance and i didn't grab my pin fast enough can you tell us those organizations that are also opposed that you're representing today please thank you madam chair representative it includes in addition to the american cancer society cancer action network the american heart association the american lung association the campaign for tobacco-free kids and the colorado group to alleviate smoking pollution gasp colorado gasp and we've been partners for over 50 years in tobacco control here in colorado thank you thank you who's missing from the group it seems like it's pretty honest thank you madam chair and with the chair's permission uh mr hours is it that you oppose the state giving the freedom to the counties or you would actually oppose the counties themselves choosing to act upon that freedom miss ours thank you madam chair representative conte as i stated earlier in my remarks and i believe he had to step out we our our coalition was opposed to the 2008 bill that amended statute to criminalize the possession youth possession of tobacco products as defined currently we also see extending that uh coverage beyond just the state and municipalities to counties is also uh something that that we have to oppose we you know we want to be consistent and it's important and if i may it it's important to understand when when our organizations look to methods to try to remedy this situation we look to science and evidence basis uh uh types of opportunities and and among those are are the ones i mentioned earlier about tighter regulation of the sale of tobacco products education penalizing criminalizing youth possession by kids is not one of the cdc recommended best practices to to achieve that thank you so much for your testimony today thank you so i have two more witnesses um chris is it pratt yes and then uh eric bergman do you guys want to come together introduce yourself one at a time and and share your remarks thank you madam chair my name is chris pratt i'm an assistant county attorney with douglas county here representing their interests in this bill i think we've the committee has already heard a good deal of testimony on the expansion of the use of e-cigarettes and how technology has really outpaced somewhat the law in in trying to prevent miners from getting access to these types of products um there is currently there was it the question was raised there is currently on the law 2514 301 which makes the possession of a tobacco product by a minor illegal that also allows municipalities home rule or statutory to enact stricter prohibitions conspicuously missing from that is counties and that may be because many counties don't have large unincorporated populations that they deal with but as has been mentioned in douglas county we have almost an entire city that we deal with and we have been approached in douglas county our sheriff's office has been approached by the school district who has schools both in municipalities and in unincorporated douglas county and they have been approached asking what our sheriff's deputies can do to help them enforce this prohibition against miners having tobacco products to which the answer has been we don't think we can do anything the law doesn't give us as a statutory county authority to go beyond what is written there which is more or less to tell them that's illegal you shouldn't be doing that and so what this bill proposes is to allow counties the same tools that municipalities have for the constituents and the leaders of those counties to have that tool should they need it to help the schools in in the case of douglas county or to help the county itself deal with what is a growing problem among minors in the county um now there's been a lot of testimony about the possibility of what this could grow into but i think as representative condi pointed out there are a lot of checks and balances that would prevent the abuse of this authority one the local governments are answerable to their constituents if their constituents don't want fines then they won't elect local leaders who are going to impose fines for this however every community being unique they all need the discretion to deal with this as the community dictates and in some communities it may be necessary to impose fines i do not have any information on exactly which municipalities have chosen to to enact an ordinance imposing a fine or what effect that may have and so i apologize i won't be able to enlighten you any on that however i can tell you that it seems peculiar that municipalities are granted that authority but counties are not there does not seem to be any particular reason for that loophole and in douglas county this is a particular problem because we have a very large population incorporated county we have i i want to say at least three high schools in unincorporated parts of the county and we we feel basically powerless to help the school despite their pleas for assistance to do anything because without this legislation we do not think that we have the authority to assist the schools in any way other than to send a deputy to tell those teenagers you shouldn't be doing that that's illegal and i think we all know what a teenager is going to do when you tell them that so all we're really asking for here is to put the counties on par with municipalities we're not asking to impose fines although the local officials and their constituents may see fit to do so we're just asking for this loophole to be eliminated for the counties to put on the sp be put on the same legal authority as the municipalities within their journey with the counties and for those for the discretion that's given to municipalities be given also to the county thank you miss brett quick question because i thought i heard um in statute that there is already code that could be used for your sheriffs to address possession of a minor with uh tobacco products when i say you can't do it i'm just having a hard time understanding why a sheriff can't exercise the law in douglas county thank you madam chairman the i believe you're talking about the aclu that testified that there is a law that imposes a fine under the criminal code title 18. but that's for selling that's for selling tobacco products to a minor representative farlow you have the statute there can you help us i thank you madam chairman i doubt that i can help you but i can i can raise the question we have the draft i can raise the question again maybe it's maybe it's for the drafter but yes it seems confusing to me between sure a good buck it's 25 14 301 and in 1813 121 and i don't think we're seeing where it excludes counties thank you matt thank you madam chair jennifer berman with the office of legislative legal services in the criminal code section 1813-121 it does provide that let me just check well a person who is under 18 years of age and who purchases or attempts to purchase any cigarette tobacco products or nicotine products commits a class to petty offense they can be punished by a fine of 100 but i believe that they could do community service to work that off as well the statute goes on to mention again that's purchase or attempt to purchase which is potentially different from possession oh i'm raising my money if i make something i'm in church here okay so but i i thought you know cause i you know we have 7-elevens all up and down colfax and i know that if you have possession if you're a minor and you have possession of tobacco product that's illegal so it has to be somewhere isn't it somewhere in the statue for a minor to have possession of tobacco that is you're trying to say it's not you're saying it's legal no man okay mr pratt madam chair thank you no a separate statute 25 14 301 makes possession of tobacco products by miners illegal however it does not impose any penalty and at the very end in subsection four you'll note that nothing in the section shall be construed to prohibit any statutory or homeroom municipality from enacting an ordinance that prohibits possession of cigarettes tobacco products by a person who's under 18 years of age or imposes requirements that are more stringent than that provided in this section however as i said conspicuously missing from that is counties who have no authority that is not granted to them by the state expressly members i did find that in statute representative rosenthal uh thank you madam chair and um i have a couple observations which you may or may or may not want to respond to and they're going to come across as snarky so just forewarned uh on the one hand you know no municipality is taking advantage of this and of this except for as was mentioned woodland park and isn't there a message there that they obviously don't think that this is necessary that it's effective and then or maybe you should answer that one first or speak to it if you wish mr pratt um as i said and i and i believe um as was testified it's it's unclear how many are taking advantage so there was one example that was known and i do not have further information to enlighten you on who may be using those all i can tell you is that as i understand it our school district in douglas county has approached us and asked us what we can do in this regard did you have a follow-up yes and and the other one is and i suppose that's it's not gonna happen but you know highlands ranch could always incorporate and then they'll have this right so i think i have a good solution for you no comment right no comment representative aren't i suppose i'm still unclear on the goal are they trying to help kids stop smoking or punish them and those are two different things in my mind representative conte bill sponsor madam chair i would surmise as maybe i have slightly more confidence in the douglas county commissioners that certainly if i were sitting in the role that there might be a fee but that it might be connected with a community service to be able to work it off or a educational class that would be designed to stop kids long enough to give them a message of what this that we're opposing a small fine right now this is pennies compared to what this habit could cost you did you say you're already imposing a fine is that no i'm not no i'm i'm saying that if i have faith that the douglas county commissioners who are the people that are primarily asking for this bill would have that common sense that no simply imposing a fine is not going to do the job and i would suspect that that would not be their intentions and that given the opportunity they would exercise the same wisdom and judgment that exists within this body well i'm wondering why then the douglas county is the sheriff's police department they're saying that they just feel hopeless that they're just rendering they just don't know what to do with these kids and they have no tools there's nothing they can do madam chair just just so you understand there is no police department because it's not a city it's the sheriff so it is the county sheriff's that is the law enforcement mechanism i just want to make sure that we're we've grasping the sheriffs are saying that absolutely nothing they can do with the the kids that are having nicotine products in douglas county is absolutely nothing they can do oh madam madam chair so the way the law reads right now it's illegal and so if the school is having difficulty enforcing through their own prohibitions which we've already discussed can lead to a slippery slope of just ejecting the student from school which is not desirable they ask the sheriff's office often who provide deputies to the schools to have a deputy tell these students it would be helpful is my understanding if the deputy could issue a ticket because right now the sheriff's office understanding of the law and our understanding is that that is all all they can do at this point is to tell them that's illegal you need to stop because you're saying they cannot issue them a ticket right now i'm saying that 25 14 301 does not give the county the authority to do anything um so i'm glad i'm glad you referenced that that section of statute i'll read it again it's 25 14 301 and it specifically states i'm not an attorney but it's fairly clear and this is a state law possession of a cigarette or tobacco product by a person who is under 18 years of age is prohibited and so this is similar to where we have other state laws that the county can enforce and frankly that cities can enforce in this case let's just talk about county since we're talking about counties there are domestic violence statutes and it's against state law to do certain things and your sheriff can uphold the state law in regards to domestic violence charges so why wouldn't they be able to to look at this statute and and say yes there's something on the books that prevents the possession of a cigarette or tobacco products by a person who is under 18 years of age mr pratt well and that is the problem we're running into is they they can't go to that we'll say teenager we'll say a 16 year old teenager the officer could approach that 16 year old and say that's illegal you have to stop that's all he can do he has no authority within the county's jurisdiction to do any more than tell him that madame thank you madam chair representative lebsock can you show me the penalty well representative um i i guess i don't mind answering a question from the the bill sponsor madam chair i guess i will do that so the question isn't um whether or not there's a penalty the question is is it appropriate for you to criminalize a child's behavior in your bill we just heard from the american cancer society and the whole group of tobacco control alliance folks who are opposed to the bill and they are saying that penalizing kids with a fine is not part of their agenda and they're saying it's not going to help and so that that's what i'm basing my decision on is what's in your bill um also if i'd have been here in 2008 i'd have been voted no on the other one as well um but that's neither here nor there further questions for mr pratt representative singer thank you madam chair i think there was a question in there first i want to give one of the people who's sitting at the table the opportunity to respond and then i'll queue up my question if that's appropriate representative thank you madam chair i'd just like to remind you representative lebsock this is not criminalizing as we've heard from representative lebsock in his conversation with the drafter this is a civil penalty it is not a criminal that what they're asking to do their authority does not extend that way and so this is simply a civil matter it is not in any way going to put anyone on anything on anybody's record so to speak i just want to make that clear so representative singer thank you thank you manager actually i'd like to respond to representatives i have i have a follow-up thank you madam chair you just said it's not going to be put on anybody's record and so if the county um initiates a penalty and fines then that child when they are they have that fine associated with that behavior is not going to be on their their their record representative conte uh madam chair thank you so much that is my understanding singer thank you representative lebsock i think one of the things that and this is how state and city and county sort of operate if you already finished your drink so i won't mention north clint but but uh but but how how states so the interaction of state and county and this has come up in taxation issues in the past unless the state specifically enumerates the ability of a county to do something it it is legally questionable as to whether that county is able to to take its own action and that's i mean we can disagree with the the content of the bill or why we're bringing this or the or even the you know the intentions behind it but i think it's just just to get that off off the table here that's part of the challenge when we tell cities something it's very different than when we don't enumerate something um in statute as it relates to to counties that being said so i i've i guess three questions here and two of them are yes no questions and one of them's a little bit longer so so is the douglas county school board in in support of this bill it's the douglas anticipating if it's that many young people who are smoking and the sheriffs are not able to do anything about it and they they can collect some revenue there's probably some thought about uh projected revenue that they can capture from ticketing and fining they probably think that we could probably get maybe a hundred thousand dollars if there is i am not privy to any of those plans um slightly different question so so schools are tobacco-free campuses right as it is now so i mean i would really like to have you know someone from the school district as opposed you know sorry that you're here for this question but but um part of the reason i asked if there was a plan is there's a lot of steps that go um in front of suspension or expulsion or any number of things and so i would hope that the douglas county schools can comment on this or that you can comment on on their behalf in some way about what it is about a tobacco-free campus that is not working for them and whether or not what's happening right now in douglas county schools isn't happening in other schools such as denver or other places where you're more able to to respond to these issues because those powers don't have to be enumerated mr pratt thank you and i am not sure it was a long question so i'm trying to place my thoughts i'll make shorter statements next time douglas county as i as my understanding is was approached by the school board and that's what initiated this whole effort from douglas county is that the school board was having difficulty with their system it was not working as and i think we've heard some testimony as this e-cigarette situation has grown i almost exploded really what we're finding is it's very difficult for the school to police this on their own students can very easily hide them they're not lit they can put in their pocket they can disguise them as other things and so the schools when they do find them are having difficulty because they can't really if they can't really stop people from using them and it's easy for them to hide them the times they do find them there really is no there's no way to stop the behavior to to to present the students with a situation where there's they don't want to be caught and the hope i think my understanding is they had hoped that perhaps if the sheriff's deputies who help out at the schools could issue a citation that that would have a significant effect on students willingness to bring those kinds of things to school that's my understanding representative singer thank you madam chair okay so there is a plan the idea is as a financial citation one of the things that i cited and when i what i worked on you know when i was doing similar programs not with tobacco but with alcohol is time and money and you know a citation is money but i would hope that the school district actually educates their kids about these things you catch someone with with a tobacco product you say you know what you're you're spending an extra six hours in health class young man um you know what whatever it is um that you know my my first um you know i'm not angling for kids wallets as their as the first line of defense here and so that's that's why i'm trying to hear you know the school's out of ideas but all i'm hearing is punishment punishment punishment but where's the education and i understand you're not there but i'm guessing you can talk to them i'm sitting down with the douglas county human services manager next week actually about all sorts of issues because i'm i'm really committed to giving the counties the authority but if they can't explain what they're going to do with the authority why would i want to grant that authority other than the parity issue mr bergman looks like you're ready to speak thank you so much madam chair and good afternoon everybody uh i wanted to kind of uh just kind of piggyback on representative singer's question and and statement uh i'm eric bergman with colorado counties incorporated um first off i want to say a couple introductory remarks we are currently 12th in the nation in teen smoking colorado is 12th which is shocking to me given our healthy lifestyle here um we're right behind arkansas and west virginia and unless you're talking about you know per capita gravy consumption i don't know that i ever want to be associated uh with with states like that um i've had a handout today that had some articles from around the state on um the explosion of teen tobacco use especially e-cigarettes and ones from craig one's from durango and one's from loveland all kind of bemoaning the fact that we are seeing these the spike in use right now what we are doing and uh in education and i apologize because we had a health and prevention health and prevention specialist from douglas county schools scheduled to come today and she had to cancel last night on us and so i talked to her on the phone for a bit they are doing education they're doing i think everything they think they can possibly do and it's just not enough um we are what this bill is trying to do is just trying to give us one more tool you know we talk about states being the laboratories of democracy and i kind of feel like local governments are the laboratories of democracy within the state we're trying something here desperately these e-cigarettes are have become a blight uh they're also used to smoke marijuana that's the other problem they're having is it's not just nicotine products that are being smoked in these things and they are so prevalent now it's out of control um i think also it's important to remember and i think you might have alluded this in your opening remarks representative singer even the threat of a ticket may work as a disincentive um you know the fines themselves uh the even the threat of a fine may provide that disincentive to get involved with this but the way we're going now i see us going down the wrong road and we're trying something here that we feel like might have a chance and we want to see if it can work and i do feel it'll be in conjunction with more education and other preventative strategies no one wants to just start taking money away from kids but i think what we're doing right now is not working and so we're asking for some parity with the cities to try to do something more in one in a couple communities that are urban size that are like giant cities um to try and get these kids back on track and that's all we're trying to do here and i happy thank you thank you madam chair i just had questions about that do you have any data at all that um finding someone for smoking has ever been a deterrent mr bergman i do not does it i just wonder thank you madam chair um i just wonder if the posers in the room do um that's one question the other question is when you said um with all due respect that it's it's not working i i i'm i'm glad you got to finally to the piece that where there is some prevention or concern about that but it seems to me there's a request to have an additional layer of punitive uh action on on students to criminalize it further uh with a monetary fine if if the concern is really to get kids to stop smoking it would seem like it within the bill there might be something that says and all money from these fines will circle back to prevention i mean i just i i can't get over hearing what echoing what representative singer said i'm just hearing additional punishment works and i don't you don't have any data to support that and neither do i i mean i don't have any counter factuals so to be fair um and if anyone has any i'd be willing to listen thank you further questions representative clinton smith thank you madam chair and thank you for your testimony i know this bill pertains to adding counties and adding nicotine products but are there similar authorities in place for counties to penalize teens who use marijuana and do you already have authority in that area and if i pass this would it be similar to giving you a tool that you already use in marijuana enforcement which i think is unconstitutional even for teenagers it's illegal for uh kids under 18 to have possession of uh marijuana products 21 yeah under 21 it's just 21. under 21 is illegal but you can madam chair thank you um uh representative klingenschmidt it is my understanding that any device that could deliver a vaping of marijuana products would also be capable of delivering tobacco products therefore it this applies it's the same mechanism same function in the pen it's just substituting one for another so any pen that could deliver a vaped marijuana could also deliver the vaped nicotine so this bill would cover should cover the pen's use for marijuana as well represent clinton smith thank you madam chair i think you answered my question but i just want to rephrase it maybe you can tell me if i understand it properly that if this bill passes it would regulate paraphernalia or give counties the power to regulate paraphernalia which is probably being sold over the counter retail for vaping but the teens are not using it for vaping they may be using it for marijuana and you're not able to enforce that use of that paraphernalia or you're not able to confiscate that because the counties don't have power to confiscate it because they think it's a vaping product but really the teens are using it for other substances so if this bill passes it would help you prevent illegal marijuana usage using these vaping paraphernalia am i understanding that correctly mr pratt i believe you are understanding that correctly representative klingenschmidt part of the bill you'll note is to change the definition used for tobacco products from a taxation definition to the definitions used in the criminal law and that definition says any device that can be used to deliver nicotine or tobacco to the person inhaling from the device including an electronic cigarette cigar cigarette or pipe and under that definition regardless of what they're really using it for if it can be used to deliver nicotine it would fall under the purview of the counties if this passed thank you madam chair i'm sorry maybe i didn't maybe i was too long and drawn out but i thought i had a question in there if this bill is about helping kids not smoke why does it not say that any fine levies will be used for education representative conte madam chair i just like to say i don't know that we would be opposed to that um that is you know as i'm talking with my counterparts here representing the counties they don't have any doubt that that would be exactly what they would use the dollars for they're not looking to for a new source for to pave their roads yeah so this this i i think that their heart is to get kids off of this they're trying to do anything and everything that they can to deliver this message education absolutely you know and punitive measures to deliver the the thought i can tell you that you know when it hits your pocketbook it does hurt well you know if you are buying tobacco products that's already hitting your pocketbook okay so there's already you know you're already spending your money on that adam chair yes thank you madam chair i have actually talked with uh tobacco-free kids on this topic and it's not uncommon for parents especially in the region that we're talking about to load a debit card with enough money for lunch for that child for every day of the week and they're expecting that that kid is paying for lunch every day what they're in fact doing is taking that debit card elsewhere and using it for an illegal purchase well you're saying that you're now saying that teens are going into 7-elevens with the debit cards of their moms get them to buy tobacco which is illegal madam chair 7-11 should be or wherever should be checking ids before they make that kind of purchase madam chair yes yes i have actually talked with tobacco-free kids and they have told me of an instance where the retailer inflated the price of the cigarettes knowing the child was illegal and and calculated that it would be enough if that kid bought cigarettes every week that would be enough to pay the fine that they would be levied if they were caught i think we're off topic on this one uh representative rosenthal thank you madam chair so um i don't know who would be best to answer the question but so just walk me through briefly what would happen if um a child is fined um and so how do they pay that fine do they uh do they just mail it in do they go on the internet and pay that way do they have to go to court um and then also what if they don't pay the fine is the fine increased is they they have to go to a court is court factored in anywhere in this mr pratt i believe if it's a civil fine i believe court would not factor into this and the exact handling of how it would be paid and what would happen if it was not paid is something that the local government can establish on a case-by-case basis they could in the ordinance they can decide how they want to handle that that's again part of the toolbox that they would be given for handling a local problem yeah most fines when they're not paid it issues a warrant for your arrest by civil fine you can't just have if the law enforcement issues you uh a summons or a ticket and has a fine if you don't there is consequences and typically it is a warrant but i'm not quite sure in this situation here but that is like common practice representative rosenthal you're laughing you laughing about i just i i don't know i'm just thinking like if if you if if somebody doesn't pay a parking fine you can you know they can put a boot on the car but i don't know how you put a boot on a kid i mean that grounding is grounding okay it's been a long afternoon who else has a question okay seeing none thank you for your testimony today i appreciate it okay let's see there's one more witness i have to call up mr kaplan please come forward introduce yourself and who you represent we will not be putting boots on kids welcome thank you good afternoon madam chairwoman representative fields and members of the committee my name is gabriel kaplan i am the branch chief of the health promotion and chronic disease prevention branch in the prevention services division in the colorado department of public health and environment i'm here today on behalf of dr larry wolck the department's executive director and the colorado's chief medical officer to share information from the department regarding the matters covered in hb 16 1150 clarifying the counties may prohibit underage nicotine procession tobacco use has been classified by the cdc and others in the nation as a pediatric epidemic research projects that 5.6 million youth who are currently using tobacco today are projected to die prematurely as a result of their initiation of tobacco use and preventing young people from ever picking up a cigarette or a nicotine product is a major priority of our program this bill extends to counties in ability already afforded to statutory municipalities which would allow counties to purchase to pass purchase and or underage possession or what are called pup ordinances or resolutions and we welcome this concern we agree that youth initiation of tobacco use is a severe problem and progress on reducing youth initiation tobacco products as representative singer has pointed out has slowed in fact the proportion of youth who we identified through surveillance instruments as susceptible to initiating smoking has increased since 2008 from 19 to 35 in 2013 and another survey we conducted indicated that about 60 percent of students in grades 6 through 12 thought it would be pretty easy or very easy for them to get cigarettes or nicotine products if they wanted them these data indicate that the popularity of these e-cigarettes or vape pens is rising pretty rapidly and further studies that we've looked over in the department have indicated that vapors are six times more likely to begin smoking than non-vapors and they have 40 times the odds of becoming daily cigarette smokers than non-vapors what we understand about youth usage of tobacco products is that they are the targets of clever and shrewd campaigns that are meant to entice them to purchase and use these products even though tobacco and nicotine sellers know it is illegal to sell these products to them many of these products come in flavors that really are meant to appeal to children only bubble gum fruit flavor fruit blast these are flavors that are meant to appeal to younger and younger audiences the department of public health and environment supports allowing counties and municipalities to have the powers they need to control youth access to tobacco and we have an extended history of working with our local public health agency partners to offer many programs and services to control smoking these statutes or pup laws are intended to reduce youth smoking by making kids more personally responsible for buying and using tobacco products evidence reviewed by the program however has shown that tobacco control efforts which penalize children who are often exposed to aggressive marketing tactics or illegal sales on the retail environment have not been proven to be an effective strategy for use reducing youth smoking however counties and municipal governments can pursue multiple evidence-based interventions promoted by our state tobacco control program to address illegal sales of tobacco products including nicotine products the department uses amendment 35 monies to fund the rocky mountain center for youth prevention and local public health departments to provide assistance to school districts to implement the tobacco-free schools law and to address the problem of youth possession and other nicotine products in a way that focuses on prevention and education our state tobacco program has worked with the rocky mountain center to develop and implement a program we call second chance which is a school-based alternative to suspension or penalty programs for kids who violate tobacco-free schools and or minor possession laws and we also fund the american lung association's non-tobacco cessation program to help kids who are trying to quit using tobacco mechanisms to reduce colorado's youth epidemic need to be comprehensive in order to focus on the source of the problem and the source of the problem is essentially the enticement and supply of tobacco products to children who lack the skills and independence to make good choices that can serve them throughout their life policies should include merchant and community education retailer licensing banning the sale of candy flavored products prohibiting the redemption of coupons conducting regular store inspections and supporting strong penalties for vendors who sell to minors for adults who sell to minors these strategies when applied together have been shown to reduce illegal sales we thank you for sharing this information with you and i'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have thank you thank you mr kaplan questions representative art thank you madam chair i just want to thank you for the information that's what i was looking for questions i just have a question because you mentioned that the source of the problem may not be um punishing or summoning or ticketing um the youth that the source of the problem is how we advertise and promote the product is that what i heard you saying that is correct madam chairman we uh really try to focus on that as the central source of the problem is the sales focus and what kinds of resources or support can you provide douglas county because we've heard from the school district that they support this bill we've heard from the sheriff's department that they support this bill i guess the commissioners support this bill what kinds of resources or information can you share with them about other effective models that might work for douglas county that's not a summons or a fine or ticket well madam chairman thank you we would be happy to put them in touch with the rocky mountain center and with the local public health department tri-county uh which is aware of the second chance program which is a program that we implement um that is focused on this problem it actually has a very interesting approach which i think addresses some of the questions that have been raised by the committee so we generally advocate in this program that counties and school districts and those who work with youth always confiscate the tobacco products that that should be an important part of the discipline approach and that parents and guardians should be notified as quickly as possible of a tobacco violation and this should be signed and returned to school for repeated violations that we consider and we suggest additional strategies which include parent guardian notification via telephone call by a school official conferences with parents guardians school leadership and others mandatory enrollment in the second chance program referral to school counselors and nurses for assessment including tobacco prevention education enrollment and cessation classes if the youth are interested in that written assignments around the health effects of tobacco guided questions regarding the reasons for their personal use and motivations for quitting restorative justice and community justice programs in school suspensions including tobacco prevention education programs as part of that suspension and then suspension from her extracurricular activities for a limited time thanks for sharing that information representative and it's real quick i don't want to belabor the the point but i think that was a good question that you had and i want to thank mr kaplan for identifying the programs and things that cdphe believes work one sentence in your presentation stated that penalizing children have not been proven to reduce nicotine or tobacco use in children i believe that could you repeat what you said there and that you're in your prepared statements because i want to make sure because that it speaks directly to what representative arndt was asking of other witnesses i just want to make sure i get that quote correct and from your prepared statements i think it started with penalizing children have not been proven yeah i'm sorry mr kaplan please thank you man and chairwoman members of committee and representative lebsock uh so by sentence read evidence reviewed by the program has shown that tobacco control efforts which penalize children who are often exposed to aggressive marketing and tactics or illegal sales in the retail environment have not been proven to be an effective strategy for reducing youth smoking there's a document that's put out by the cdc uh called the comprehensive community guide to preventive services which goes over public health interventions and they've looked at strategies that simply penalize youth possession and found them to not be effective by themselves and instead advocate comprehensive programs that look at a wide variety of tools thank you representative singer thank you madam chair just uh as as a repetition there can you repeat the comprehensive miss the rest of that title sure um so comprehensive uh tobacco uh prevention programs for youth initiation which include banning the flavorings of products that appeal to youth it includes a licensure of tobacco retailers it includes regular inspections and severe penalties to vendors who violate the sales rules to minors it addresses the sort of organization of tobacco product sales within the store location to make them less accessible to youth behind the counters behind opaque glass those sorts of things in addition to the kinds of strategies that have been discussed here thank you representative thank you madam chair i've just been listening to my folks from colorado counties and who have been in contact with those folks out in the field who are dealing with this their thought was exactly where your minds are that the education might be so much more the important piece and literally their fines their tickets might be as little as five dollars but along with that comes mandatory time that they have to spend in education classes and so forth it's not it's it's just a mechanism that along with one can come the other and they can group that all together and i am every confidence that the county commissioners in any county that wanted to enact any kind of ordinance would be connecting with our partners here at the state level who have the documentation and would be taking the heed and the advice from them just as we would at the state level thank you further questions for mr kaplan seeing none then at this point is there anyone else that would like to testify on 11.50 please come forward ma'am chair i so apologize pat ratliff for colorado counties i've got a meeting going there and this hearing here and this is more important um we've been reacting both representative conte and cci to what we viewed as a fairly narrow request it's clear to me that there is much more here that needs to be considered we've talked with a number of legislators but certainly not all of you we would like the opportunity to make this a rationally helpful intervention with youth and i in particular have reasons for wanting this did i introduce myself pat rat of colorado counties i've lost half my family to smoking i'm so crazed about this i can't begin to speak of it i would like everyone to know that we will work with the various sponsors to make this a bill that does not concern you about profiling or costs or anything else that views a comprehensive approach to these children that is what we intend and that's what we will commit to do with our very sponsors on second reading we would just ask you to let us have the opportunity to do what we should have done ahead of time i so apologize but i appreciate your attention thank you madam chair any thank you for your testimony today any questions seeing none thank you anyone else that would like to testify on house bill 1150 please come forward welcome to local government please introduce yourself good afternoon panel local government my name's sophia san miguel and i just have a first-hand experience with uh i represent myself um a young lady who is into those vape pens and unfortunately i didn't realize that they've transitioned into nicotine provision in the vape pen prior to just recently they had made them where they were just fumes of some vapor that didn't possess nicotine however currently now they're coming out with .6 nicotine vape pens and i no i don't smoke i don't have anything to do with nicotine it's um an alternative for some of them given the fact that full-blown cigarettes are pretty deadly at times so i support the bill if it helps young folks get off cigarettes or never even touch them well thank you for your testimony today is there any yes we'll have to make sure that you sign up okay great is there any else anyone else who would like to testify on house bill 1150 seeing none we're going to close the testimony portion of this hearing and now the bill is on the table for any amendments are there any amendments representative clinton smith thank you madam chair i have amendment l zero zero one and l zero zero two uh and they both address the same line of the bill so there may be a settled question unless one is offered as a substitute but the they sh they should both be considered together before we choose which one to move on i think okay why don't we pass them out and take a look at it and then once we get the bill the amendments passed out we will have you explain them thank you oh thank you [Applause] okay okay i think we all have copies now so the question is we're still missing one to avoid a subtle question we need to review the two amendments and determine which should go first is that right representative clinton thank you madam chair um and i'm happy to talk about both of these and i'm happy to move both of these but i don't know if i'm allowed to move my own amendment as a substitute to my own amendment why don't you explain them first so okay so i i talked with representative conte this morning let's talk about l02 first and i said why don't we add three simple words because oh i'm sorry the bill sponsor did not get a copy of the amendments here's uh another one for she's got so l02 was proposed because i noticed in the original bill line 17 we're adding or nicotine products but in the original bill line eight we're not adding or nicotine products so why did you add it to one part of the statute but not add it to the other part of the statute it seems like you're giving counties mixed guidance and so i thought to to make it consistent we should just add or nicotine products to both parts of the statute instead of just the one and i asked the drafter for that very simple amendment and she was great their drafter is here she brought me the amendment i requested it is l002 that's what i wanted to do and then the drafter also because she's a lawyer and i'm not she said when you do this it creates a problem in the definitions part of the statute and so she she drafted a proposed conforming amendment updating all the definitions at the same time and so that now becomes l001 so these two amendments are identical if you if you read the last line of l001 it's the same as l002 we're just adding those three words more nicotine products but also above that the drafter uh advised me and i think i'm fine with this and the bill sponsor is fine with this i've talked to representative conte is to update some conforming language to the other parts of the state statute so that or nicotine products is added in a handful of other places so that there's no conflict in the statute and i i would request that uh the drafter maybe come up and tell me if i got it right yes the bill director please come forward and reintroduce yourself again and respond to representative queen schmidt's question thank you thank you jennifer berman with the office of legislative legal services i do believe that representative klingenschmidt got that correct um for l001 lines 25 and 26 are kind of the meat of the amendment and they are the exact same as the amendment for l002 and lines uh 1 through 24 are essentially conforming amendments that would use consistent language throughout that statute 2514 301 to refer to cigarettes tobacco products or nicotine products so the way i'm interpreting this is that you should move l zero zero one yes ma'am i move l zero zero one there's a second second it's been moved and seconded by representative ransom is there any objection to l zero zero one seeing none l zero zero one passes and it's my understanding we won't need l02 is that correct that's right ma'am are there any other amendments seeing none we're going to close the amendment phase to the bill at this point are there any final comments before we take action on the bill representative lepsop just real quick madam chair i'm i'm opposed for a number of reasons um not the least of which the american cancer society is opposed to this bill in addition to all the i believe six other alliance members um the tobacco control alliance in addition to that opposition we heard professional opposition from an attorney from the aclu and even heard from even though cdphe testified neutral the mr kaplan simply stated that penalizing children has not been proven to reduce nicotine and tobacco use and so um for me this is a a fairly simple no vote president thurlow oh thank you madam chairman and i have to say i've changed my mind on this bill about three times during the testimony sorry and but but where i'm finally going to come down is i'm going to vote for the bill and it's it's based on you know we've gone through the law books quite extensively and it seems to me that even though it is now illegal to for an under 18 year old to possess cigarettes there is no penalty with the exception that cities can define their own penalty if they so choose and i think the the heart of the bill is just to give counties that same ability now what i would submit to everyone is that just because counties and just because cities have had that ability that doesn't necessarily mean that they've used it and as we go through all of the arguments about what's effective it's pretty clear to me that nobody knows what's effective some people think monetary penalties are effective some people think they're not some people think education is the answer and and probably everybody agrees with that but how do you do it so i i very much like mr bergman's argument that we have what's 63 counties and we have a whole bunch of cities and we have school districts and and they are just as well intentioned as we are and probably closer to the problem and and spend more time thinking about the problem of how to how to cut down on nicotine usage among young people so leaving that should given the counties the same ability that the cities have and then leaving everybody the ability in different places in colorado to do something in douglas county one way and to do it in dove creek a different way or mason county another way that to me makes a lot of sense so i'm going to vote for the bill rebsome ransom thank you madam chair i've raised teenagers you can talk until you're blue in the face and you can explain cessation programs and you can explain how unhealthy it is you can go with all of the statistics and data and sometimes you just need to have some penalties there are some teenagers that will not listen to everything that's logical i see teenagers smoking all the time i see it in denver i see it back in douglas county it breaks my heart because i have lost people to lung cancer as well in my family and i think that allowing counties to just establish some of the same parity and giving commissioners the ability to figure out what's going on in their county i actually counted i think there's six high schools that are in unincorporated douglas county and that means that if if you're up in denver those high schools that are within a city within denver they can have penalties if they choose but just because our high schools happen to be in unincorporated areas our commissioners can't and so um obviously i'm going to be a yes vote and thank you for bringing the bill representative conte for the comments represent singer thank you uh madame sharon to uh i guess reiterate representative lebsock's sentiments by i don't like this bill but i'm gonna vote yes um so uh i think this bill needs a lot of work um we we spent a lot of time in this committee just talking about uh with with director sobine about um looking at a cost-benefit analysis about how the scared straight program actually cost the state of mississippi 16 000 for every 65 spent it's a waste of money um so and and when i i was hoping to hear that douglas county had a plan or that they were trying to mimic something that another city was doing i haven't heard that either and and i understand some of the concerns about onerous um owners fines that's why we have the eighth amendment um in the constitution so i look forward long story short i look forward to seeing some floor amendments and letting the whole legislature deal with my rants because i think i think it is really important to talk about this i mean the cdc does have this report about uh preventing initiation of of tobacco use income indicators it's only 205 pages so i thought i would start with page one and now i mean i've sent it on to cci to have you guys take a look at it and see what you can come up with because we could be doing the wrong thing here we really could be i mean we we don't know i believe in more tools in a toolbox but if if those tools you know to carry out the metaphor a little further are faulty we could actually be harming harming the situation harming our kids and and that is a statewide matter of concern thank you it was in clinton smith thank you madam chair i'm pleased to join representative singer and what i perceive to be an anti-marijuana bill so i'll be voting yes for the comments madam chair i'll just before i let you have this last word i was just going to share my thoughts um and i clearly understand the impact of tobacco because my mom passed away because of lung cancer and so i believe that we should be doing all possible to prevent people from using tobacco and so for me awareness and prevention programs is the way to go but as we were talking about cigarettes and and youth and i think there is an increase of youth using cigarettes but what kept ringing in my mind is eric gardner who kept saying i can't breathe i can't breathe and the policeman stopped him because he was selling single cigarettes and so they put him in a choke hole and he lost his life so when i think about adding more penalties for cigarettes for a kid just for having possession of it just telling you where i'm coming from that gives another opportunity for law enforcement to interact with the youth now it may not happen in douglas county but i can tell you what happens in other jurisdictions and if we're going to be penalizing youth for having nicotine and tobacco products and it puts them in a situation where they have to pay tickets and fines and there'll be warrants or you have to maybe go to court i think that does set up a scenario from school to prison pipeline so i will be a no vote but it sounds like you have enough votes here for um to pass this bill but um i can't support the bill representative rodenthal thank you madam chair and um you know i have to admit i really struggled with this bill you know i'm a teacher and so i i i i've seen i've actually had a lot of discussions with the youth in my classes about you know drug use and cigarette use and um you know so you know i can see where the bill sponsor is trying to find you know multiple ways to reach these youth and and but i think as what was revealed in testimony that we heard you know by by the the advocates that they don't have any data i mean there's no background there's no research there's no best practices it and i'm i'm just frustrated by that um and and i wish there was more of that that we could say well you know what in i don't know let's say greeley colorado they did a they had their own fine program and it cut down use by 40 or or something like that and i just don't see it so i i can't uh support this bill today thank you madam chair i have to say that this is you know i think what we're used to seeing at the state level is the complete program laid out and i think somehow it's frustrating for us to let go and allow local counties govern themselves but i have complete confidence in those local elected officials that are closest to the problem and if they don't do the will of the people that elected them guess what they might not get reelected and that's how democracy works all we are doing is allowing them the freedom do you not think that they will be conferring with the center for disease control and our local uh health and human services department i think they absolutely will i think that they will come and they will work alongside them do you think that they will not do study sessions and go to and look at other places in other counties and see what they have done that might have worked i absolutely have sat in on some of those study sessions where county commissioners have sought and sit around and talk to with other commissioners and find out what have you done in your county what's worked there just as we do here at the state house i would ask you have a little faith in your local elected officials this is simply permissive this is simply saying you can enact whatever ordinance you want to enact maybe that ticket is going to be for three hours of an education class on the detrimental you know possibilities that smoking can bring to your life it may not be a fine penalty at all as far as monetary and that is in the purview of now the local counties as we would give them the authority but i don't know how much time you have spent with your county commissioners i've spent a fair amount i've sat in on their study sessions i've sat in when the local sheriffs came to talk to them i've sat and when the state came and talked to them i've sat when they when they sought out council at huge meetings with 64 of them around a table with representatives from all over the state and they conferred with one another i can tell you that they do not make decisions lightly and they understand that they are accountable and i understand that county sheriffs are accountable and if they are perceived at being onerous where kids are concerned and delivering penalties that are too harsh for the circumstances they will reap the benefits or the penalties from their constituents come election time colorado ranks 12th in the nation for teen smoking use we at the state level are set the policy our partners at the county level implement those policies as we allow them to all this bill does is give the freedom to say you can set the policies as you see fit we're not prescribing anything that they have to do we're saying we trust you to talk to the cdc to talk to the state health
_pIiOPFvPBQ,02-11-2016,3356,CO,the addiction and it's definitely magnified for youth adolescents and young adults whose brains are still developing and studies show that so i just want to wrap up keep it brief denver public health sees labeling as responsible and preventative measure that addresses what our state communities and businesses concerns are regarding the toxic nature of nicotine and the addictive nature of nicotine we've heard testimony that a lot of businesses are are in the dark they would like to receive guidance and i think this is the opportunity that we can provide them this also helps our communities and it's the ability to just be responsible to not only our youth but also to our businesses that are looking for guidance so on behalf of denver public health we'd like for everybody to please vote to pass house bill 1137 thank you madam chair and representatives and i can field questions there any questions at this point we can also ask questions after the next witness all right why don't you go ahead thank you madam chair again i'm lisa van ramdunk the executive director of the colorado association of local public health officials we are the association that represents all of the local health departments in colorado every county is covered by a local health department and in your individual jurisdictions you may find that you work with more than one public health department we've got a lot of great experts we heard some terrific testimony the other day and so i will certainly defer some of the technical questions to those great experts but i did want to come here and tell you that calfo is in support of house bill 1137. our local public health agencies are engaged in their communities as many of you well know in helping current tobacco and nicotine users quit and in helping prevent youth and others from starting to use these addictive products in many of our public health programs our public health professionals are working with new moms and families to help them ensure safe environments in their home where their children can grow up to be healthy and so the idea of labeling is is certainly a place where we can help ensure those safe and healthy homes for kids and i think as with denver public health we broadly as public health agencies see this type of labeling as a reasonable step towards helping community members make informed decisions about what they put into their bodies and helping inform parents and other adults to prevent accidental ingestion of these products by children so thanks thank you are there any questions for either one of these witnesses yes oh representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair uh and thank you both for your testimony miss von rimdenk uh is when i was first given the idea for this bill it was by a county health official who was out there in the community trying you know they have a charter they're out there trying to help families and they brought me some of these deceptive bottle labels which we have pictures of and you know without my bill and without labels it's kind of the wild west out there i think the real retailers are trying to figure out what is best to put on the labels but in the absence of guidance does it leave in your opinion room for either a lack of information or deceptive information so that teenagers and moms are having this argument about what's really in the mystery bottle miss van remdunk thank you madam chair thank you representative um yeah i think you know generally we support the um broad idea of informed consumers and i would agree that with the enormous variety of um labeling that we see and the the actual contents of these these bottles that this is one instance where stronger labeling requirements really do equal um a more informed consumer i think there's we can debate labeling on a lot of other a lot of other substances food that we put in our body but this is certainly one of those labels that seems a lot more a lot more common sense and a lot less controversial any further questions thank you both very much for your testimony uh mr clinton representative clinton schmidt we have one more signed up in favor um so shall we go forward with mr kaplan yes ma'am all right is mr kaplan here there he is come on up and tell us who you are and who you're here representing good afternoon madam chairwoman uh representative mccann and members of the committee my name is gabriel kaplan i am chief of the health promotion and chronic disease prevention branch in the prevention services division at the colorado department of public health and environment on behalf of dr walk the department's executive director and the colorado's chief medical officer i'm pleased to be here today to convey the department's support for house bill 1137 concerning a requirement that package nicotine products have a warning label we have numerous points of entry and interest in this legislation we are concerned about accidental poisonings we're concerned about nicotine and its health effects but primarily we're concerned about nicotine as a pathway to a lifelong addiction to tobacco products tobacco kills well over 5000 of our residents every year and we know that for every death there's about 30 more individuals who suffer from lifelong tobacco-related chronic illnesses uh the financial costs of this burden are tremendous and so we are doing everything in our power to limit the effects of this addiction and problem uh this bill would require simply the products that contain nicotine except for cigarettes a few other products and approved cessation devices carry a warning label that simply states the product contains addictive nicotine there are some amendments uh which do a bit more but that's the primary focus of the legislation all the products that we're talking about today represent novel ways of delivering nicotine products and these are an emerging challenge for public health very little is known about these products and very little regulations particularly in colorado exist for them and despite a lack of understanding about them their popularity is rising we know that colorado has actually been singled out as a test market for unregulated products such as these and this uh this test actually has been enormously successful data shows that from 2012 to 2013 the increase in sales of starter kits for e-cigarettes and cartridge refills increased first for starter kits by 500 percent and by cartridge refills almost a thousand dollars in convenience stores uh sorry a thousand percent in convenience stores so uh we can see that this popularity is rising and we see this in our data of colorado youth as well we'd like to correct the impression that e-cigarettes are a cessation device there is data that indicates smokers are interested in using these products as a cessation device unfortunately the data doesn't support that these actually work as a cessation device in fact the most recent study which came out just a month ago showed that if you were a smoker and you started using e-cigarettes you were 28 less likely to smoke to quit smoking than if you didn't use e-cigarettes at all and that if you're a vapor and you are not yet a smoker your odds of becoming a smoker are actually 15 to 40 times greater the american family of pedia academy of pediatrics did a study of about 35 of these products and found there were substantial discrepancies between what they contained and what was on the label and while the fda has proposed rules which will require labeling uh those rules are not likely to come out uh for some time we're not quite sure where the omb is on that process and in addition the regulation states that the rule would require these postings 24 months after the rule is released so if that gets held up in court it could be a substantial amount of time before any labels appear on these products and stores we know that warning labels work we know this from our experience with tobacco control when you see a label you're more likely to think about quitting you're more likely to hesitate and for all of these reasons we would ask you to support house bill 1137 and we think that warning labels are a good common sense public health strategy thank you for your time and happy to answer any questions you might have thank you mr kaplan are there any questions for mr kaplan so i have a question um because i happen to have some nursing students meeting with me this morning and um we were talking about another bill but i just was chatting about this bill it was interesting because one of the nurses said that she used to smoke so i asked her about the e-vapor issue and in fact she used it to quit smoking um which was interesting to me she said she did reduce as the woman testified on tuesday that she did actually decrease her amount of nicotine and it took her about a month but she has successfully quit so i'm interested in the data that you were talking about because it does seem as though some people do use these as you know to help them quit i don't know that i call it a cessation device but um have you all studied at all locally about how um in colorado how these may have been used to help people quit smoking if you know mr kaplan thank you madam chairman uh we uh have not looked locally at this data we have just looked at the studies that have been done on national level i'm not aware or familiar with any studies that have been done locally i myself have no doubt that there are lots of anecdotal instances where an individual was able to use these products to successfully say from smoking the problem though is on the mass when you look across a large number of people which is what our responsibility in public health is is to look at the broad population and for every individual who might um successfully quit there are multiple individuals who to simply fail and what the data shows what this most recent study both a study in england and a meta-analysis performed in the united states show was that um if you take up a cessation strategy using e-cigarettes you're actually 28 less likely to quit than if you didn't and if you use other approved cessation devices now there are lots of approved cessation devices that are available to colorado residents through the colorado quit line and any resident who calls up regardless of their insurance status would be able to go through a quit strategy and receive coaching from the quit line which is sponsored by national jewish which has testified in support of this legislation thank you any other questions for mr kaplan all right oh representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and thank you mr kaplan for coming i'm glad to have the department's support on one of my bills the there is a amendment being proposed that would exempt from our labeling requirements any product that the federal food and drug administration has approved as a tobacco use cessation product so i understand from your testimony that most e-vaping liquids are not yet on that fda list but if they did someday gain access to that last and the fda approved them as a cessation product then would this amendment remove the labeling requirements in question mr kaplan thank you madam chairwoman i believe it would um the you know we are not opposed to uh the vape uh industry and and vaping in and of itself our concern right now is that it's a it likely shows and this is what the data shows uh that it's a pathway to addiction to actual tobacco products and right now we don't have evidence that these work as a cessation device on the broad scale and so if the fda were to perform a study and if the science seemed to indicate that the data were changing over time then we would certainly welcome these as a cessation strategy if that could be shown the point we have is that right now we don't see that and so for that reason they wouldn't be exempt under the amendment representative thank you madam chair and thank you mr kaplan i just on tuesday we heard that the fda was going to approve this within a matter of weeks or months is that your impression as well mr kaplan madam chairman thank you uh so there is usually about a 90-day process uh for the omb to review uh the proposed rule uh from the fda and uh they received the rule from the fda um in about october so they're actually a little overdue for having released it so it could well be that it it does come out shortly we anticipate that there are probably lots of concerns uh across the board with that regulation and so that might hold up the release further we simply don't know when it's likely to come out what we do know is the proposed rule which we all saw about a year and a half ago stipulated that these warning labels that are called for in the regulation won't appear for two years after the release rule date of the rule uh and so for two years these labels will not be required by fda regulations so even from today we're going to go two years without any labels and then as has happened several times with fda actions in this area there's the likelihood of a lawsuit to hold up the implementation of the rule and injunctions and such could pull that implementation period much longer thank you any further questions representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and since our last meeting i was handed this statement from the federal register and i'd like to ask you about it the the proposed federal warning label that may be coming forth has one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve words uh compared to gordon's magic four words my magic four words are warning contains addictive nicotine but this is a proposed label that says warning this product contains nicotine derived from tobacco nicotine is an addictive chemical leave it to the feds to say in 12 words what i've already said before but my question is even at the end of this 90-day period isn't there like a 12-step process this is at the end of the 90 days i was told it's just the first step that might be approved and that is for the feds to decide if they can even have authority to label these things mr kaplan so uh thank you madam chairman i that is a question that's sort of little beyond my expertise federal regulations are not something i understand very closely my understanding from looking at this information in the interim between tuesday's testimony and today was that the rule-making process is a nine-step process and when it goes to omb uh it is at the eighth step and so the ninth step would be approval from omb uh for the fda to release it uh and then fda would proceed to think about sort of an implementation timeline they could be as aggressive my understanding from what i read uh to call for the immediate um sort of implementation of the rule which would then initiate the clock they would set off a two year waiting period but they may sort of get held up for a variety of reasons so i think you know your allusion to challenges with federal operations is a good one we don't really know what's likely to happen all right see no further questions thank you very much for your testimony thank you madam chairman thank you members of the committee and thank you representative klingenschmidt we'll now move to uh individuals who signed up in opposition um let's start with catherine york good afternoon ms york if you'll tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone sorry hi my name is catherine york i'm here on behalf of the colorado chapter of the smoke-free alternatives trade association also known as safada i'm the chairwoman for our board and i'm also here on behalf of uh my small business located in denver called boosted llc we are an e-liquid manufacturer i'm also a licensed attorney and accordingly i am going to speak to you a little bit more about the federal regulations um i have only been with the company for six months but my husband started it and after leaving private practice i came over full-time but my background should allow me to answer a couple of the questions that maybe were unresolved earlier um so here's a printed out copy of the notice of proposed rulemaking applicable uh in this instance the deeming regulations that were first released in april of 2014 by the fda there was a comment period it closed back in 2014 it is cr uh this rulemaking is in the final stage of the regulatory process at the federal level it it omb the office of management and budget or o ira is another um right part of that they have been reviewing this since october 19th so it is a little bit more than 90 days they are allowed to give themselves a 30-day extension for a total of 120 days for review and we i'm under the impression based on speaking with our federal lobbyists that that's what's happened in this case and accordingly we expect that the regulations will be finalized within weeks um in this regulation it does in fact propose the warning that representative clayne schmidt uh read and the fda uh has not allowed us to call ourselves cessation devices because this is the only type of regulation they are allowed to um issue for our product based on a few court cases including the saterra case that was from 2010. specifically this regulation is uh was issued based on the fda's authority under the tobacco control act um the long version of that name is the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act of 2009 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic cosmetic act allowing the fda to regulate nicotine products or tobacco products uh which was defined as or which was defined to include products that were derived from tobacco products which is why our nicotine products which although they aren't like a traditional tobacco product are being regulated as tobacco products and are subject to the tobacco control act now part of the tobacco control act in section 916 is that there is an express preemption clause for a variety of things including labeling which is why as soon as these regulations are issued under the tobacco control act authority the fda regulations will expressly preempt any contrary state labeling requirement and um i believe uh representative clinton schmidt may be aware of this because the expected amendment has something to do with uh include something about fed contrary federal language is that correct that really mandated language and so i i believe he's aware of the express preemption clause but um that so our conclusion your your time is up oh i'm just gonna just sort of wrap up i'll give you a few another minute or so to wrap up we're just concerned that having state requirements that we're required to submit to in addition to these expected federal laws like are impossible for our businesses to do uh the these products are can remain on a shelf for a year and so the small businesses that buy these products and are unable to sell them during that time um are not able to plan for the future if we have a a state law that's going into effect on the first of january and we have to plan for this federal regulation so i'm just concerned for our businesses the and i believe that it's a waste of uh the legislature's time because of the expected federal regulations all right are there questions for ms york representative lyongraph thank you man madam chair can you tell me ballpark um what these products bring in annually to our state i do not have numbers for our state specifically but it is a billion dollar industry and we have more than 150 small uh businesses operating as retail outlets so that uh they're mostly mom and pop shops and they're spread across the state um and so those stores you know having inventory is expensive for them and they're concerned that they will not be able i'm sorry that's sort of not your question but they're concerned about being able to comply with this law as well as plan for their inventory um throughout the year and buying quantities and all of the things you would expect from a labeling bill representative blankraft thank you madam chair so if the federal law goes through every product that is produced will have this labeling or whatever labeling they come up with yes ma'am on it yes york um yes sorry uh catherine york uh i was supposed to introduce myself yes all of uh our products are going to say warning this product contains nicotine derived from tobacco nicotine is an addictive chemical unfortunately we're not sure if the feds have decided to change that that's part of the mystery of the rule making process and so we can't actually change our labels yet to comply with the expected regulation because if they change like three words in there then we're that we have to start over anyways it's it's sort of a tough spot for us representative blancraft thank you madam chair so if this bill goes through you could conceivably have to change your labeling and then and maybe label all these products with this language and then the feds could come in and use one or two different words to get to the same point and you would have to redo yes ma'am and that is a um yes that is exactly our problem and for example my company has hundreds of thousands of labels like on hand right now and we would have to reprint all of them um in order to comply and that's the manufacturer's perspective the shops have a different perspective obviously but changing our labels multiple times just because there is a state law requirement is very difficult thank you uh representative eskar thank you madam sharon thank you mr york for being here you just talked about how you have hundreds of thousands of labels already um set to go how long have you all been aware that there's going to be something even coming from the feds when it comes to labeling this york uh thank you um we technically have been aware since it was introduced in april of 2014. however the regulations were not submitted to the final stage at omb until october of last year and so we try to think about planning but we are also aware that we need to be able to still maintain our supply chain so that we're not out of labels when we go because we have multiple flavors and we make each one of them in five strings of nicotine so that you can go down over time um so it's a lot of labels it's a lot of ways represent vascular thank you madam chair and i believe last time we were all together i'm going to say her name wrong with sven drewska bondroska was here and she brought different bottles from her store and some of them had labels do the labels you're talking about for your company already have warnings on them can some of the labels have warnings on them already miss york um yes ma'am i have not seen a bottle that is uh sold in a retail location that doesn't have some sort of warning i actually uh don't remember seeing any that uh representative clinton schmidt was able to find either so i think it's standard in our industry to have some sort of warning about the product containing nicotine i think the concern uh was brought up that some people have something that says may contain nicotine on their non-nicotine strength uh e-liquid my products do not have that but some products apparently do though i do believe that would make it easier to keep those products out of the hands of children because i believe that was brought up and that seemed to be a corollary issue though i i have not seen any products that contain nicotine that do not have a warning on them in and i've seen thousands of different products at these trade shows and uh speaking with our retail locations that we do business with thank you so i have just a quick question so your business is just the manufacturing you don't do any retail uh yes ma'am we then wholesale to about 1500 retail locations across the country and we do business in 45 states which means that when any state would propose something like this we would be concerned because we would want to be able to comply with that state law and that's why we welcome reasonable regulation some parts of the uh notice of proposed rulemaking are not quite as reasonable as we would like but this part makes sense so that there's a standard warning um and at it's appropriate at the federal level to have this type of labeling requirement so that it is standard and we can do business freely in interstate commerce so um so what kind what are the labels that you have in stock do they contain what warning do they contain see um my all of my products that contain nicotine state that they contain nicotine they contain uh they i believe they all say nicotine is an addictive drug or something similar and then they have the prop 65 california labeling requirement which is to state that nicotine uh may cause birth defects and other reproductive harm all of my labels including the ones without nicotine say keep away from children and pets and must be over the age of 18 to use or possess that is just something that we as an industry have adopted as a standard thing even even with the non-nicotine products just because we do not want kids getting their hands on it our target audience is the 45 million adult smokers in the united states i mean it's an amazing number but it's true there are significant numbers of adult smokers in the united states that yes it's anecdotal evidence but many of them have written us thank you letters as the manufacturer saying that we save their life and you know you can't totally just ignore that if you're a manufacturer it feels it's difficult to hear the testimony sorry i'm rambling but it's difficult to hear testimony demonizing our products when there was a longitudinal multi-year study in the united kingdom that found that e-cigarettes are 95 less harmful than traditional cigarettes and that 5 was mostly based on uncertainty because you know there's unknowns in the world but that also 44 of the population in the united kingdom did not realize that e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking public perception of our products is based on how they look and on and fear and uncertainty but the science that has been done is is not quite as uh bad as it might have been made out to be i would be happy to send um the study itself it was more than 100 pages so i didn't print it out i have a summary if anyone would like that from uh the public health study i i don't know if that's appropriate but if it is please let me know i don't think any of us want a 100-page study there's a summary it's only three maybe a summary yes representative thank you madam chair and just to follow up you said that you already have the california law labeling my question is if this law were to pass would you have to put colorado's label on it california's label on or would you have to do separate labels for separate states miss york it's not quite as bad as having to do separate labels for separate states though if there's more than one or two states that are having requirements the space runs out as you saw like we already have to use very small writing and that was remarked upon and we are concerned that at some point it will be illegible if we have to fit everything on our bottles um and the i would also like to point out that the california market is extremely different than the colorado market we are not as big a market as california a lot of e-liquid manufacturers are willing to change their labels for california so that they can still do business with those thousand literally thousands of brick and mortar locations for specialty vape stores but here in colorado we are not that big of a market and i think that that really harms the small businesses operating in colorado because those retail locations are competing with each other so they having different products in each store is great but if you remove the variety then they have less to compete with each other and they're definitely are not able to compete with online products that it is almost impossible for us to really enforce a labeling requirement against representative valantine thank you madam chair how far off are we from the california law ms york that has already been enacted it was it's not specific to our industry there's something called prop 65 and they have about 60 chemicals anytime one of those products is found in a one of those chemicals is found in a product that product must write a prop 65 warning i'll tell you that when i went to disneyland uh with my family this last summer there was a giant prop 65 sign in front of disneyland saying disneyland may contain chemicals known by the state of california to cause birth defects or cancer and that's the prop 65 warning and so although it's very bizarre and it does make people very concerned when they see it on our products it is not limited to the vape industry and it is just a product of california's regulatory system all right anyone going to disneyland remember that warning before you go um are there any further questions yes sir mr representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair and thank you mr york for your testimony you know after our last hearing i met many of miss york's clients out in the hall and they showed me bottle after bottle many of them with the california label on them and i first of all want to commend you and your retailers for self-initiating for being above board for being very honest with the consumer about what's in your labels and on the record i'd like to state all of the labels you showed me i believe are comparable to the language that we would require in colorado law and so when you see amendment 002 later it says federally mandated language or the following or comparable language i think your excellent retailers are already meeting what will be the colorado standard by offering comparable products what we are trying to get after are some of these other mystery bottles and you said you've never seen these but they're out there and there's other less ethical perhaps or at least less forthcoming manufacturers that are producing things they don't even list the ingredients on some of these on the front it says zero nicotine on the back it says contains nicotine there is no uniform standard and so while your retailers are meeting a very high standard and thank you for doing that there are others that we're trying to bring up to your standard and that's the intention of my law um i wasn't sure if there was a question in there but i did have a question about what that statement um do you mean that products that just say contains nicotine would meet your standard representative klingon schmidt uh thank you madam chair and thank you for the question i think we'd have to say something about being addictive also but okay otherwise it's pretty comparable i think so that is my concern because you work go ahead my concern is that not all of this the products even though they are labeled quite clearly in a variety of ways um already say addictive so that does mean that a number that literally thousands of out-of-state manufacturers would have to change their labels in order to do business here we as in-state manufacturers uh would be likely to change them just because we would want to still do business in our own state obviously um but that represents a significant burden on the small businesses the tens of thousands of small businesses in our industry all right thank you seeing no other questions thank you for your testimony ms york all right ian firth you tell us uh who you are and if you're here representing anyone and just so um witnesses know there is um on the table in front of you a timer so when it is green you are good uh when it turns yellow you have 30 seconds left and when it turns red you are done so keep that in mind if you come up to testify all right go ahead mr firth is this on my name is ian firth uh oh sorry uh go ahead good afternoon comedian can you pull the microphone down a little bit closer there you go my name is ian firth i am the owner of a colorado-based e-liquid manufacturer i am also a co-chair and founder of the colorado chapter of the smoke-free alternatives trade association i have some clarifications on some notes or testimony that was given on tuesday can i add those to the record uh on tuesday we heard from various uh people about certain things i wanted to clarify those there was a comment made about e-liquid being available at retail at 500 milligrams strength that would actually be a 50 concentration of pure nicotine the current agreed upon ld50 of pure nicotine is 500 milligram for an adult so consuming orally one mil one milliliter of such e-liquid would be fatal in fifty percent of examples nothing like that is sold or available to the consumer pure nicotine is only available to laboratories and suppliers who dilute and distribute it to companies like like mine as a manufacturer myself and many others work with nicotine at 10 concentration or 100 milligram per milliliter from there it is diluted during the e-liquid manufacturing process to 0.3 0.6 1.2 etc resulting in our industry standard labeling of three milligram six milligram 12 milligram statistics about uh increases in nicotine poisoning are misleading when presented as they were on tuesday if we think back 100 years there were very few automobile accidents because there weren't very many automobiles this is very similar with e-liquid e-liquid nicotine poisonings will increase simply due to the increased availability and usage of electronic cigarettes the 3000 poisonings that was mentioned on tuesday sounds like a lot compared to a prior year number of only 1500 but it's still a very small number compared to 150 000 cosmetic poisonings 118 000 cleaning substance poisonings 100 000 analgesic poisonings or fifty thousand vitamin poisonings all reported for children under the age of six in the year of 2014. but there was also discussion about propylene glycol uh there were some incorrect where points were raised um pg is one of two carriers used in e-liquids it's commonly used at a total volume percentage of 50 to as low as 10 percent uh pg was claimed to be a skin irritant and some people are allergic to it but it is still commonly used in hand creams consumed in thousands of foods and sold over the counter as a dry mouth rinse in 1942 propylene glycol was being used as an airborne germicide in 1950 it was registered by the fda for use in hospitals as an air disinfectant it's still used in various forms of air sanitizers due to its antimicrobial properties when aerosolized the other carrier that wasn't mentioned is vegetable glycerin also known as vg it is a palm-based or renewable soy-based liquid um it's a non-toxic sugar alcohol it is also used in similar pharmaceutical and food industries that was that now on to labels um vaping is a consumer-created solution to the tobacco problem our the vaping industry has been self-regulated for the better part of a decade every day roughly one million bottles of e-liquid gets shipped across the united states from over 500 brands to almost 10 000 specialty vape stores each one has a different label each manufacturer has their best estimate at what the industry wants or will require months ahead as we are constantly aiming at a moving target early on labeling was simple just a flavor name a logo and nicotine strength as the industry matured we looked to other consumer products for guidance labels started to include more detailed ingredient lists the ratio of pg to vg and warnings we didn't see poison warnings early on since vaping wasn't widespread the people who were vaping knew what they were buying as the consumer base grew it was clear that more information should be placed on labels nicotine warnings age warnings and keep out of reach of pets warnings were added last year we saw california proposition 65 warnings appearance labels even though many companies are exempt from the requirement and many others disagree with the claims made by the state of california your time is up if you could just wrap up quickly please we have born on dates expiration dates poison control information barcodes from automated manufacturing facilities for tracking inventory and batch and lot numbers for traceability is the type too small in some cases yes labels are designed for shelf appeal do they look interesting to the consumer when viewed from the other side of the counter sometimes the logo takes up more space than it should labels are also designed for the employees so they can easily select the right product at the correct nicotine strength for the consumer we have several trade organizations both svada that i'm a member of and the american e-liquid manufacturing standards association amc has standards they publish that many of us follow svada has similar standards that we follow as well all right you your time is up um representative escar has a question thank you thank you madam speaker are these i'm right here i know yes we couldn't read them on the other day i handed out a bigger version of it so this is this is your labeling that is my labeling mr first i have to recognize you before you answer go ahead representative so my question on um the top one the 1.5 milligram up here is that the milligrams of nicotine mr firth that is milligram per milliliter correct representative escar my question then is on this particular label and the ingredients listed it does not have nicotine in the ingredients is there a reason for that mr firth it's listed under the warning portion of it it represented investigar okay so the warning portion says this product may contain nicotine but it's not have it's not listed in the ingredients is that correct mr first that is correct and representative esker thank you man i'm sure and then i'm to assume the zero milligram label is the non-nicotine label correct mr firth correct all right and so the the product that does not contain nicotine also has the warning that says this product may contain nicotine is that correct mr firth that is correct okay i can tell you why that would be great go ahead tell us why it's zero milligram it's still an adult product it's still an adult product is that okay do you want to ask for a further question representative escar and using using the word may mean yes it may contain it they look at the zero when they realize it doesn't but it's still an adult adult product okay representative blantine thank you madam chair and just to clarify these were the labels that we could not read on the bottles that we were presented with tuesday is that mr firth uh i thought mine were big enough for people to read but only one of mine got passed around but there are others that were the the typeface is very small representative geneal thank you madam chair and under the lot number um i see is there a shelf life for these i'm not sure if that was answered last tuesday or not mr firth uh there is a shelf life up to two years okay thank you representative landgraf thank you madam chair you mentioned that sometimes the the labeling the lettering is very small and hard to read i don't see anything in the bill that has a lettering size requirement mr firth there's nothing that we know of uh the beer industry is an industry that our microbrewery industry is an industry that has actual font height requirements for readability so this representative line graph thank you ma'am chair so this this bill wouldn't fix the small labeling um anyway mr first it would not one last question uh representative blindgraf thank you madam chair do you know of any products that have um dangerous for children or keep out of the reach of children or something that's on one of the amendments mr first products that aren't liquid products i'm sorry what's up i didn't quite get the question i was wondering if you are aware of any um existing products that have uh keep out of the reach of children or like to find the actual language sorry um yes keep out of the reach of children uh mr firth uh planing supplies uh no representative landgraf i meant do you know of any of these uh vapor products the vapor products that say that mr firth oh from other manufacturers yes hundreds and hundreds of them okay thank you representative ransom thank you madam chair i have a question about the labeling is there any reason that it couldn't happen on a box as opposed to on the bottle that it actually comes in or are these products ever sold in a box mr firth they are sold in boxes uh which gives an opportunity for better merchandising marketing as well as giving them a lot more inch space to put more information on them but it's a trend we're seeing over the last six months any further questions right uh representative klingenschmidt thank you madam chair and thank you for your testimony i'm noticing on these labels they're very colorful and they have sort of candy flavoring descriptions orange cognac liqueur or white chocolate mint but i also notice a skull and crossbones where you have indicated the phone number to the american poison control association which of the four ingredients and i'm going to list these ingredients propylene glycol vegetable glycerin natural or artificial flavors or nicotine which of those four ingredients are poisonous mr firth the poison is in the dose but nicotine nicotine okay thank you all right seeing no further questions thank you very much mr firth your testimony mike weber you could tell us who you are and if you're here representing anyone thank you council representatives sorry thank you i'm the owner of an electronic cigarette store located right down downtown denver it's called mystery vapor bar we've been open since 2013. i have about five or six employees i'm also a homeowner so you guys represent me quite a lot in this state um foremost though i'm also founder of the president and president of the colorado vape association again we're a small grassroots type of organization that represents retailers and consumers across the state and are dedicated to supporting the owners employees and customers within the industry with the latest product information um safety guidelines and so forth um and just so you know cva members are you know good citizens of the state there are as we had mentioned 150 stores across the state which people are collecting uh rental space sales tax on as well as employee taxes and so forth so we do represent a significant amount of money in the state these labeling requirements from a manufacturing side just so you know a box and things like that that costs us a lot more money if we have to package it and someone puts it in that box and does that we're not big tobacco we don't have fully automated systems and things like that but just so you know we're very self-regulating we even most of the places in every brand in my store including my own private label brand are made in iso standard labs so the largest players in this industry are already using lab grade stuff because they're already consulting with the fda and applying for applications right now to meet their guidelines so there's a lot in the works but from the labeling side if i have to relabel every single label three times and then my suppliers down there bound by which states to do it i them and being impacted from a logistical standpoint on when they can get this because they'll be doing smaller supplies and so forth our customers are impacted thus my sales are impacted and your tax revenue is decreased so you know there are a lot more implications into this now since 2009 we've always been deemed that the fda will eventually regulate us and so forth but what you need to understand though is that this isn't about cessation it said in 2009 all we claim is that this is a healthier alternative to tobacco we are not a cessation product never have been last time i was here tuesday a doctor who and both the doctors that were present did not back up any of their claims of information with one study name all the studies right now are being done mostly in the uk but just now and you can look it up and i'd be happy to provide you all this information the uk just passed e-cigarettes to be allowed in hospitals right now in addition in regards to the labeling requirements just so you know a pack of cigarettes and a cigarette has over 5 000 chemicals i have yet to ever see 5 000 written articles on a pack of cigarettes why is that allowed i'm not sure but we are forthcoming with all of our information so it's part of the cva and every supplier that i've ever dealt with excuse me um already are abiding by labels regarding poisoning i'm sorry regarding poisoning labeling is not the answer that's a safety cap and all of the products in my store already have safety caps beyond that i mean parents need to take some responsibility for what they have in their house you guys have you know amended things for marijuana and kids consume edibles all day not all day but in similar packaging of that it can be in a safe locked thing and that parent leaves that brownie on the counter and guess what the kid eats it is that on the marijuana manufacturer i don't think so i think parents need to take a lot more responsibility for that stuff regards to alcohol have you guys ever had um what's that one that has um red red fire or whatever it's called um fireball excuse me fireball that has 20 to 30 percent propylene glycol in it it's called fireball and by the way when you go to argonaut people are allowed to give up free samples of liquor that's legal right now in in those places so there's a lot of things that aren't very clear on on why we're being impeded but we just like to inform you guys and educate you and i will personally i i live downtown as well supply you with all of our studies that the only ones that are legitimate right now are out of the uk not just hearsay provide you at least a good well-rounded view of our industry because there's also concern that we get tied in with marijuana as well and that's not the case one out of five people are tobacco smokers and they have nothing to do with that so we want to make sure that's also very clear mr weber your time is up can you if you just have one more sentence that's fine yeah um i would just essentially um as part of the cva and as a local business owner um oppose this bill hb 1137 it'll just create an undued cost for us it'll inhibit us ability our ability to do sales it goes all the way down the chain the fda is going to eventually mandate this anyway and they already have i would like to sit down and for something that's being you know voted on i feel be important for you guys actually read that legislation so because last meeting was clear that no one even knew that under 18 we legally can't even sell zero nicotine out of our stores and that's a law you know one that was set and it's not clear that you guys are aware of the laws that aren't even on the books but i would be very happy to sit down one-on-one and you guys can come into my store and get a second look because a one-store image is again there's very crappy marijuana dispensaries are not good and there's ones that are professional but they're you know they're in business and they need to be monitored so we are for safe products um we're for anything against anti-miners and labeling requirements but we do ask that they're fair because tobacco does not put 5000 ingredients on there we put five thank you mr webber are there questions representative vlanteen thank you madam chair and um at the very beginning you introduced yourself and said that you were president of an association the colorado go ahead mr webber colorado vape association represent valentin so are i guess i'm assuming you speak for the the vape association then yes and our members okay represent blondie so um representative klingen schmidt has a a small bottle in front of him that i'm assuming was the same one that you showed us um tuesday no i never presented anything no representative klingen schmidt did and he told us a story about a store in the in the colorado springs area that had kind of their own i don't know what you would call it they were mixing it in the back is the way he explained it is that a common practice in your industry mr rubber thank you when it first started just so you know all of these products propane glycol vegetable glycerin nicotine food flavorings and water are all federally legal you can go in the walgreens walmart anywhere you and i can all buy them that's why this is an issue no matter what because even if this whole thing gets banned and you guys put us out of business people can legally go and mix their own so this is not going to go anywhere but to answer your question i all anyone and part of my membership does not do that and everyone is moving towards all lab grade iso certified labs because they understand the ramifications and things coming down the pipeline but currently sure there are some mom and pop stores that do that i don't abide by that and within our mission statement and our requirements they're not members of my association representative lontine i i appreciate that all of those ingredients are available to anybody thank you purchase i i get that i just have a concern with that being a process for sale i mean if i want to mix up at home that's my choice but when i buy something at a store i would like to know that it's you know gone through a clean lab and there's strict standards involved so i just have concerns about the mom and pops in the back mixing it up because we have no idea what the strengths are and cleanliness and those standards so mr weber i actually completely agree um i have a manufacturing background before i ever got into this business um so i have always had even my own privately labeled brand in an iso certified lab um so i you know we i am it's it's not for me to say that other people my industry should not adhere to these standards we are all for safety and things like that within my store though all of my products are coming with all of these labels all of these requirements and everything people have said everyone in my store and our members for instance all have name a product name of strength name of all ingredients not for sale to miners warning keep out of reach of children and pets warning and the volume size so that's what's present the other thing too when it comes to poisonings i would say there's a much bigger issue to make sure which all my products do and no one is brought up but we all have see i have safety caps on every product i sell that's not mandated so that that right there will stop a kid from being able to drink the liquid and so forth and the parents sort of know they know what they're buying when they walk in our stores they come in there for consultation representative janal thank you madam chair and just a quick question about um the the vape association how many uh people and or businesses are we talking about uh mr weber um five of the ten but if you go you can go to my uh we have a facebook link page and i'll be happy to send it to you we have over about 500 to 1000 members and i'm continually adding new real content and real studies that i'd be happy to provide with you mostly out of the uk most of things we've heard here i haven't heard one you know who they're credited to by anyone even the health department and just so you know before i started my business i went to the denver health department and have recorded and asked if there was any issue with e-cigarettes before i even opened my store they looked at me and said absolutely not there's no issue with this i said are you sure they said go forth so you know there have been decisions and and the city has been collecting lots of tax for me for years now and we're for complete safety and labeling i agree i just think we should let the fda handle this so we don't incur a million other costs which are just to potentially put us out of business anyway i also would like to say that it's not very fair that tobacco again has 5 000 known chemicals in it they only list a few warnings on that but their lobbying money can do a lot we're a small we're small stores around here aiding to help people and again we are not this is not a cessation issue we're not we're not even allowed by the fda to claim cessation so that's people use that publicly but all we can say is this is a healthier alternative i'm an ex-smoker myself not smoking anything is by far the best but there's plenty of people out there that smoke marijuana too and where the studies on the health effects of that that's not being federally mandated right now but this state has given them access to do that i would just like to see fair playing grounds as well representative ryden thank you madam chair and i may have missed it but i'm looking at the fiscal note and it talks about the liquor enforcement division and how they average 2 460 tobacco inspections a year that they anticipate that this would add about five minutes per inspection and so they're not looking at any kind of increase in costs and i'm wondering do all the vape stores sell other sell tobacco products as well and or do you think that they would be more exclusive to just that the product um and would require a whole separate sort of uh inspection process mr royper um no currently vape stores only sell basically liquid nicotine our whole industry is all about getting existing smokers giving them an alternative to get off this press about miners things like that you guys have already enacted under 18 we can't even sell zero nicotine so retailers have the most to lose here worldwide it is perfectly legal to buy any of these products and at the walgreens and make it yourself so the retailers of anything are the most professional watching these things i actually had the liquor board come in this past year just sort of showed up got an a plus rating and they walked around made sure we had no 18 plus warning made sure they they're watching people id which we do we have everyone id in addition i even have one of those high-end id scanners just like marijuana does at their desk just proactively because i i do care about our constituents and our consumers so there is a lot of proactive stuff here that uh we are doing as an industry represent brighton thank you madam chair so i guess what i was trying to get at was are we going to add a a number of new locations that are not being inspected now for by the liquor enforcement division or would your store and others already be included in what in inspecting that they do mr weber um i mean i'm guess i'm not sure for every location we have we're bound to be inspected so we're just talking about the extra time for them to go to more businesses but wouldn't but i guess that what i'm confused about is don't we want further business growth in general why would why would we be concerned about them going for five minutes to inspect we have no issue with the inspections if anything they can come every week i'm not sure what you're saying representative ryden thank you madam chair i guess what i'm asking is if you're currently under tobacco laws or liquor laws and if indeed there's no additional work for them to do or have we do we have a miscalculation in our fiscal note and perhaps there would be additional costs to the government to inspect additional stores i see thank you um when he came into my store no he had a pre-list of everything that was just you have your sales tax license up there do you have nicotine products it's no different than them walking into a liquor store we're bound by the same criteria i have stuff at my my pos i have stuff at the front door we have our all of our you know trout you know insurance for employees i mean your stuff for any general business so yeah there's nothing else besides that we don't serve food um you know there's nothing we're just a retail store so yes as long as we have our fire permits we have all of our postings we have our stuff there is absolutely nothing that's added to that list that you guys currently use to inspect liquor stores and you know and everything else that abides by the same standards thank you uh represent minecraft thank you madam uh chair i just i noticed on the fiscal note that it says penalties range from a written warning up to one thousand five hundred dollar fine would that be per bottle this is probably for representatives i'm not sure mr weber could answer that but maybe represent clinton schmidt do you know thank you madam chair thank you representative landgraf and also representative briden for your questions about the fiscal note my understanding is that uh two years or before i became a legislator that senator nicholson passed a bill to make it illegal for teens and that bill when it passed probably already had a fiscal note that put in place that these products since they're now illegal for teens they need to be subject to inspection and so my understanding is those inspections are already happening the only difference with my bill is that they got to look at the label now to see if the label is accurate and i was told by the fiscal analyst yeah this is going to take an extra five minutes but they're already doing the inspections they're already at all these locations and if anything i have an inverse fiscal note where we make a little bit of money because some people if they get it wrong they might be fined so this is is a negative cost to the state if it passes product any further questions representative primavera man i'm sure but you don't know this all for sure do you mr yoshikawa no because it hasn't been released since you know what we're doing is we're waiting on it i would love to know exactly where i stand and what's going to happen and it's right down the pipes but to pass something and then to have the federal one pass shortly thereafter it's kind of silly i think all right see no further questions thank you so much for your testimony today and uh mr croom i think it is [Music] if you want to come up and tell us who you are and who you're representing today i don't need these to know who i am but i need them my name is wilson croom i'm president of the colorado association of distributors our members provide products to convenience stores everything except for the beer coat and direct store delivery products and it does include tobacco and nicotine products first i'd like to mention since it came up on tuesday the accidental use by child or consumption by a child on january the 28th the president signed a bill requiring nicotine products to be packaged child proof that'll be effective in july 180 days neither cad or its members or anyone i know in the industry opposes labeling of products containing nicotine we supported inclusion of nicotine items for prohibition to underage sales this bill creates a labeling requirement that will be resolved by fda while the timing of fda action is not certain it could be prior to the effective date of this bill or shortly after when the fda establishes these requirements they will be consistent nationwide while this bill causes all product not labeled as call for in this bill to be unsalable on january 1 2017. the fda requirements will allow phase in period distributors and relayers would be able to sell product this would create a burden for wholesalers and retailers because it's highly unlikely that you could run your inventory to zero on december 31 of 2016. so whatever product they held at that time would be a complete loss to the business because it couldn't be sold it's not likely that manufacturers could justify unique labeling just for colorado and if this if this becomes effective before the fda action and this would create a situation where they didn't produce product that could be sold to and by colorado businesses the affected product is legal in colorado and there is a consumer demand if an environment created is created whether it was not available here by the retail community they could turn to the internet across state lines or illegitimate operators to acquire the product at a cost to the state and law-abiding retailers and wholesalers regarding enforcement we currently have a huge problem with operators selling out of the bounds or back of the trunks of their cars tobacco products that no tax is collected on we've tried a number of times to work with the revenue department to find a way to resolve this because it's costly to us as business people and there's not been success with that so these same dealers would not be reluctant to sell an unlabeled product containing nicotine and i don't think they'd be concerned with age limits thank you all right thank you very much mr croom are there questions for this witness representative ryden thank you madam chair and i maybe should have asked this sooner of the one of the vape shop owners but is it your experience that um from the distributor side that a shop would purchase like a year's supply or would it be like a month-to-month sort of situation mr crew that's difficult to save representative riding because if you try to maintain an inventory level that you can satisfy your customers needs up to a given point uh you could have one product you may have three months supply of one you may run out from three or four days if you can sell it but it'll be i mean it's just the art of inventory management it's not so fine that you could say all right this is all i'll sell through january 30 i mean december 31st so i mean it's hard to put a number on that but it it'd be impossible to not wind up having to throw away a lot of product all right see no other questions thank you very much for your testimony thank you we ask you a no vote so members of the committee um we have patrick maroney i don't know if he's here today but he's here for questions only he works for liquor enforcement for the state so does anyone have questions for liquor enforcement that's a good question so the question is do they enforce this well i don't think we have we don't have it yet so but it's probably well that's a good question i don't know is mr maroney here i don't think he's here so never mind um all right we have um a question for the drafter did she leave jennifer i can't see her she's behind the pole there you are you want to come back up and tell us again who you are and who you're representing thank you madam chair jennifer berman office of legislative legal services i think representative eskar has a question for you thank you madam chair i actually have just one or two okay and this may be for you or for the fiscal analyst so going back again when we were discussing the limitations on fines on line 20 of page two the fiscal note says it could be fines up to fifteen hundred dollars where in fact statue it says a fine of between one thousand dollars and fifteen thousand dollars for a fifth or sub subsequent violation within a 24 month period and my question is is it really up to fifteen thousand dollars for a a fifth sub subsequent violation and to that question is a violation one bottle without the right label is it one visit to a store what what is a violation and how do they acquire how many miss berman thank you madam chair representative veskar um the statute does state in section 24 35 506 which concerns the penalties that a fifth or subsequent violation in a two-year period could get the minimum of a one thousand dollar fine up to the maximum of a fifteen thousand dollar fine and as drafted the unit of the violation might be the best way to look at this is the is a packaged nicotine product which could mean that multiple packaged nicotine products in one place that do not have this warning label could each be viewed as a single independent violation of each other they could be viewed as multiple violations whether that's how it would be enforced that i don't know uh representative escar thank you madam chair so just to clarify that i'm hearing you correctly the way the bill's drafted take [Laughter] i think you have to be 25 so you're probably what 17 or 18 or 16 seven years so we'll see you back up here no but seriously if you um want to make a statement you can tell us what your questions are and then maybe someone else will ask them of representative klingenschmidt well i was just wondering what the economic detriment would be on the small business side or if there would be any economic detriment at all for the relabeling of all the e-liquids or if it was just a nuisance to the actual small business the mom and pops and what they'll say would be doing okay i think that's something we'll probably be taking into consideration when we vote on it several of the business owners indicated i think that it would have an economic impact on their businesses do you have any other comments um i was wondering on if there was any evidence or studies on either goods specifically whether or not there would be an effective deterrent with a warning label with a warning that will be an effective deterrent specifically to the e-liquids representative escort has an opinion thank you madam chair and actually i have a question for you on that then as as a teenager does a warning label on any product deter you from using a product um i've never used a product but if i did i don't think i'd be inclined to read the side of the label now okay representative janal thank you for being here and um being brave enough to come up and and talk to us all i just wondered um being a high school student uh do you see this and on yeah within the um high school mr ott um i haven't seen it within my own high school but i do have a family member who is one of the small mom and pops so i was wondering if the economic detriment would be grand enough to shut him down because he used to smoke two packs a day and now he doesn't smoke cigarettes at all and now he has a steady income any further questions representative geneal just a clarification on the students what percentage would you say are using vape cigarettes in my high school mr ott one percent okay probably less thank you thank you very much for coming up and participating and yeah um mr before you leave we have some sign up sheets in the back we need you to sign up as a witness all right thank you very much all right that concludes well is there anyone else that wants to testify any other students looks like we have a lot of you here all right um that will conclude the testimony phase of the hearing representative klingenschmidt or anyone else are there any amendments to discuss regarding the spill yes ma'am there are amendments um i have prepared and i think were distributed several days ago amendments two three and four and i'm just been made aware of amendment zero zero five and i believe the drafter is working on zero zero six which will hopefully resolve the question of representative landgrass and eskars about multiple bottles versus one violation so again our goal and i'm asking the drafter to bring this amendment that she's working on right now and she showed me a handwritten version of it that would say we're not going to let's let's wait till we get that amendment and let's go ahead and talk about the other amendments do you want to move l02 yes ma'am i well there's probably some discussion because we need to resolve the differences between l002 and l005 why don't you go ahead and move l002 because i believe l05 is a substitute to it so we'll discuss them both once both of them are moved thank you madam chair therefore i move amendment l002 and is there a second oh second okay representative brown seconded all right and there's a substitute to l002 representative ryden thank you madam chair and i move l005 as a substitute amendment to l002 is there a second second second by representative genoal all right representative klingenschmidt tell us does everyone have a copy of l02 and 0 0 5. okay tell us about l 0 0 2 and i know you haven't had much chance to look at the substitute but representative ryden can tell us about her substitute thank you madam chair actually five looks like what i started with when i was drafting l zero zero two and the reason we didn't end up with a repeal version is because and we ended up with the l zero zero two version which i think is better is for two reasons number one the department and the counties were in the room with me when we drafted l zero zero two and i believe they told me they support this version of the language that is federally mandated or the following or comparable language and that gives maximum flexibility to retailers we don't want them out in no man's land and we don't want them with two conflicting rules and so i'm concerned and i'll wait till representative ryden uh introduces or talks about l05 before i uh oppose it but when we can when we were considering doing a repeal version we went against that because there could be if we did a repeal version this strange instance where the feds come out with a rule but we already have the colorado rule but it it's not exactly the same and therefore we'd have a double rule and i want to avoid that and so we came up with the ver the flexible language in l002 where it says either or and i think either or would prevent these retailers from going in no man's land where we have a state law and then we have a different federal law that that does not preempt or does preempt and we end up with two different laws the either or language allows them flexibility and i think it would cede or give way to federal language most of the retailers i think would choose federal language since they're selling across state lines but without that flexibility then the retailers could be in a bind and therefore we provided the maximum flexibility in l02 notice also in lines 10 through 13 we're exempting for example nicotine gum or products that the fda has labeled as legitimate tobacco cessation products all right thank you representative clinton schmidt representative ryden do you want to tell us about l005 thank you madam chair well i think l05 really clarifies that when the federal government does act it will supersede what we have and we will repeal the language that we that's in this bill and i believe that that is really what will happen and i want to make it just wanted to make that clear that we wouldn't have two parallel systems going on at the same time which i don't even think would be legal all right are there questions about the amendments representative janal thank you madam chair and representative clinton clinton it's my understanding what i heard from some of the people coming to testify today that the president just signed a something that would in 90 days uh put a warning on uh tobacco products no it's uh for the safety caps it's for the safety caps the way i understood it but representative clinton do you know madam chair you're correct uh representative janal your statement is incorrect in 90 days what's going to be required are child proof caps and even if they have child proof caps on nicotine products there's still no federal warning label requirement even in 90 days that has not been signed by the president that has not even been authorized as a rule in fact the current rulemaking decision process has not even decided if they have federal authority to make any warning labels whatsoever so the apples and oranges represent valentin thank you madam chair um i'm wondering the california language i hate to be coming back to that but it seems like that's such a large market and they're already our large manufacturers complying with that although it's under their proposition 65 but would um would their labeling suggestions fall under the comparable language language and and and does the california labeling include anything about addictions and keeping out our reach of kids representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair thank you representative lantine i haven't read the california law but i have read all the bottles that were presented to me as having been manufactured in california and they all did use the word addictive and i think that is comparable language to what would be proposed here in colorado so i think i have yet to see a bottle in this room or anywhere uh maybe with the exception of the one that i bought in colorado springs uh that that has some attempt at these warning labels that would not be comparable language i'm trying to provide the maximum flexibility when i use that word comparable language and i think that's a pretty low bar for a legal standard if someone's going to go into court and say well you know our language has these 10 words and maybe they're not even close to the same as my four words they're still comparable i think that's a pretty loose standard [Music] representative lontine thank you madam chair i was just curious if the attorney who testified on behalf of the industry was still here she could comment on that she is here ms york do you want to come up we'll allow testimony on that question about the prop 65 question ms york you introduce yourself again please uh my name is catherine york i'm the a co-chair of the safada right i'm from colorado and i'm sorry prop 65 only addresses the it does nothing to do with addictiveness of nicotine it has nothing to do with nicotine in general nicotine is just one of many chemicals that the prop 65 warning applies to nicotine specifically is a chemical where you have to put a warning that says this product contains nicotine a product known by the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm that that's all you have to put to satisfy that requirement for nicotine it has nothing to do with addictiveness and um as we discussed during my testimony earlier some products do not say that nicotine is addictive because there is dispute within our industry about whether or not it independently is as addictive as other tobacco products and so until the fda regulations come out it is unlikely that manufacturers will all independently adopt a warning that says nicotine is addictive and uh representative clinton schmidt said that unless it says addictive it's not comparable and i believe comparable actually is kind of ambiguous and that creates some uncertainty for retailers because they have to judge whether or not it's comparable and that puts retailers in the awkward position of now making a legal decision that could cost them 15 000 on a bad day so i'm sorry but comparable is not the perfect standard either even if it's intended to be flexible flexible is not always great as a legal standard thank you i represent primavera thank you madam chair and this is probably a question for representative ryden who had this l005 drawn up what we saw yesterday or whatever day we met in committee were the warning labels labels were so little that but they still weren't legible and this amendment says uh the following or comparable language is conspicuously placed on the package in a warning label i think they were conspicuously placed but i still couldn't read them because the font was so small so i was wondering about a conceptual amendment to say something about a warning label that is readable or something like that um miss york no this is for representative i'm sorry representative bryden thank you madam chair i would not object to such a conceptual amendment although it does concern me that if we start specifying type size we would be putting our our small business is sort of in the same position that they're talking about now in terms of having to change it for a specific state it that does concern me all right um is there any other yes you may leave thank you miss york are there any other comments on l zero zero two or l zero zero five we'll we'll be voting on l zero zero five first um [Music] so any further comments on l005 representative klingenschmidt i presume that you are opposed to l005 am i correct yes madam chair i'm opposed to l005 and if i could draw everyone's attention on l005 there are lines 14 and 15 which are never going to happen and i'll tell you why if there's going to be a federally mandated warning label for nicotine products it's not going to say that do not contain tobacco because remember we discussed that colorado statute has nicotine or tobacco and colorado law considers nicotine as not tobacco but federal rules are labeled that nicotine is derived from tobacco so when the federal rules come out they will describe nicotine that is derived from tobacco they will never make a federal rule that describes a nicotine product that does not contain tobacco and so that will cause this double law where we have a state law if my bill passes and then we have a different federal label that is mandated by a federal rule but it doesn't trigger this repeal because the federal rule will say there has to be a label but it won't use these words and so it will not actually trigger a repeal of the colorado law and we'll end up with two laws if l005 is adopted and that's why we we considered doing it this way but ultimately the drafter and and the department and the counties we're all in the same room together we decided to create more flexibility to make sure that whatever the federal rules are we don't run into a problem with preemption and therefore we came up with l002 which avoids the preemption problem all right are there any further comments so um what we're going to do is we will ask if there is i will ask if there's an objection to the substitute l05 which is a substitute to l002 if there's objection we'll vote on that substitute uh if if it passes then it becomes part of l002 which we will then vote on it replaces l002 so we don't need to vote on l002 if it doesn't pass then we'll go back and vote on l002 any questions lots of confused looks so we're going first of all let me ask is there an objection to l05 which is the substitute to l zero zero two there is an objection so we're going to vote and representative escar has a confused look on her face so let's see what she has to question my question is before we vote on l005 is what representative klingenschmidt just said factual because that i think does mess up the intent of what we're trying to do with l05 so here's my suggestion because i don't think we really know precisely the impact of l05 i'm planning to vote no because i think if we will and go ahead with l02 and then if we find out more information there can be a second reading amendment if we if this bill passes because i have some concerns myself about what l zero zero five um what impact it has and i want to make sure before we vote on that that we have a clearer understanding of what the federal government might or might not do and i don't think we really know for sure so that's what that's what i'm going to do um i don't know if representative ryden or representative clinton schmidt have any further comments representative ryden thank you man i'm terrible i i i just have a disagreement with representative klingenschmidt on this matter and after speaking with a drafter that's why i presented amendment l005 so folks can make up their own mind about it all right there is objection so now we will vote on l zero zero five and again if this passes then it amends the bill and we don't vote on l zero zero two if it doesn't pass then we'll go back and vote on l zero zero two all right miss king could you call the role representative brown no representative buckner no representative esgar pass representative humphrey i'll go with a drafter yes representative joshie no represent klingon schmidt no representative landgraf i'm going to go with humphrey and say yes representative blanteen yes representative primavera yes representative ransom yes representative ryden yes representative esgar because i know the drafter is smarter than me yes representative janal um because of the drafter yes madam chair no so that amendment passes eight to five so uh that will supersede amendment l zero zero two so let's move on to l zero zero four or three sorry representative clinton schmidt thank you madam chair um i move l003 and is there a second second who seconded it uh representative vlantee all right um tell us about l003 thank you madam chair this amendment was brought to me by uh children's hospital and national jewish health and their concern and i was neutral on this amendment actually until a few minutes ago when one of the uh opponents of the bill came up and handed this out this orange label that has skull and crossbones i mean mr yuck stickers right and they they have the poison control center right on their and they told me what nicotine is a poison and i didn't really think of it in those terms until they really explained that but now i think it's essential that we keep this out of the hands of children this these products are labeled like bubble gum or like cherry or banana flavor it's intended for human consumption in some way although it may have a child proof cap i think it's still imperative and i agree with uh the children's and health advocates that say this should be kept out of the reach of children it puts that extra thought in legal adult buyers of these substances that you know we ought to protect our children at least by giving them the information that it might be dangerous so i i'm in support of l03 are there any questions is there any objection to l03 seeing none l03 will be adopted all right tell us now about l004 thank you madam chair i move l004 thank you is there a second okay second by representative humphrey now you can tell us about l04 thank you madam chair l004 again tries to deconflict with federal definitions of what a tobacco product is because the fda is already label requiring labels on tobacco products but not yet on nicotine products and so the department in fact insisted and prodded me to where i finally caved in and brought this amendment to say that instead of just requiring a label on any product that is contains nicotine that is not a tobacco product that we specify which kinds of tobacco products so the following tobacco products are described in federal rules and that includes cigarettes cigarette tobacco roll urine tobacco and smokers tobacco as those terms are defined in the tobacco control act so this helps align with federal law when you're talking about what is tobacco well these four kinds of products are defined as tobacco and federal law and so this removes ambiguity from the colorado version so i urge a yes vote on l04 are there any questions i think you invented a new word deconflict deconflict well anyway is there any objection to l004 seeing none l004 will be adopted now we have l006 which just arrived so can you tell us is do you want to move l06 thank you madam chair i move l006 is there a second second second by representative gennall tell us about l006 thank you madam chair we just drafted this on the fly in response to representative landgraf's and the drafter confirmed that without this amendment there could be ambiguity if a retailer has a hundred bottles for sale does that mean they get fined a hundred times in one visit well this amendment would fix that and say no no no that's not what we mean we're not trying to find them a hundred times in one visit this would limit it to a single store a single visit even if they have a hundred bottles they only get one morning they get one fine and not a hundred fines at the same time so i am intending to resolve the discrepancies properly identified by representatives escar and land graph and i support this solution to what i think is the problem they articulated and therefore i support l06 are there any uh questions regarding l006 is there any objection to l06 seeing no objection that amendment is adopted are there any further amendments by representative klingenschmidt or other members of the committee seeing none the amendment phase is closed and we are now ready for action on the bill representative klingenschmidt would you like to move the bill thank you madam chair this is an exciting moment for me i move house bill 16-1137 to the committee of the whole with a favorable recommendation as amended all right is there a second second representative on teen second um would well are there any comments from members of the committee and then we'll give representative clinton schmidt an opportunity to wrap up representative landgraf thank you madam chair um i know that my name is on this bill but after careful consideration of all the facts um i'm sorry but i'll be a no and obviously i will be asking to have my name removed if the bill goes forward representative humphrey thank you madam chair um and thank you representative clinton schmidt for the bill i appreciate what you're trying to do here and and we certainly don't want kids um um you know getting into this stuff but uh i you know i i like to think in terms of personal responsibility with the parents uh this can't be well shouldn't be sold to the kids that's illegal um and i just think that this is uh you know a stop gap measure that's going to be a uh could really be a stop business measure from what we've heard from business owners you know regardless of what you know we might think about the product it's a it's a legal product um so i'm just you know i'm i'm i'm thinking within the next matter of months that there's going to be federal regulations so i'll have to be a no vote for today all right other comments representative vescar thank you madam chair and at first glance of this bill i was supportive of it and the more we've been digging into it and the more i'm finding out that the federal regulations are supposed to come down very soon knowing that there's already many warning labels on many of the products that are being sold i just i i'm afraid that this is going to cause a lot of conflict for small businesses specifically in my constituency and across colorado honestly and i do believe that these products need to be regulated i do believe these products need to be able to warn people that there is nicotine in them and that there is a poison in them i just am afraid that this bill right now is just going to cause more harm than good when the feds are supposed to bring down the sentence so i respect the idea i want to protect children as much as you do i just don't know if this bill is the best policy for all of colorado right now representative brydon thank you madam chair and i was sitting here listening to the testimony and thinking about my own history with my own son who you know has managed to get to 37 and is thriving and is doing well but when he was two he got into a box of salt well we all know that nacl is a poison and if you eat too much salt you can die and yet i don't believe there's labeling on the box that says keep out of the reach of children or dangerous poison inside so i have also been hearing from our small businesses and it just i remember back too when the way before we were in the legislature that a bill was passed that outlawed smoking in public places and one of the places that was hurt the most were the small little corner bars where people came to their neighborhood bar and they smoked and they drank and there was as i recall virtually no timeline on that new law and a whole lot of people went out of business and it just i agree with representative escar it just feels as if this is going to do maybe more harm than good and i do believe that certainly we should watch for the federal government to act and if they don't then perhaps we should bring this back again but for right now it just feels like we're really putting the squeeze on our small businesses not giving them enough time to really comply they're going to have product on their shelves that they're going to have to just get rid of um it just i don't know it just doesn't feel like it's something that we should be doing at this moment in time and so i am a no vote also today president buckner thank you madam chair um thank you mr klingel's representative klingel schmidt for bringing this to our attention i think your intentions were valiant your intentions are fantastic however as much as i respect all the testimony from the hospitals and i have a fond affection for all the hospitals in colorado i'm really concerned about the federal regulation that's coming down and also i'm even concerned there if there's not much there's no regulation basically on edibles and there are so many more edibles available than vapes i don't quite understand so i can't vote for this right now but your intentions are amazing and i talked to my daughter and my son and they all have children and i asked them what they thought about the labeling and i know we all try to be super conscious i know i did as a young mother and even as an older mother but sometimes unfortunately kids get into things hopefully this won't happen with this particular product but i don't think the timing is good right now for small businesses and i'm going to wait for the feds to come down so i'm going to have to vote no representative gennall thank you madam chair and thank you representative clinton schmidt for bringing this bill forward i think it's opened our eyes to uh an issue that we'll be watching and i know you and i sat down and talked about this and um at at the time i thought it was an excellent idea um and i thought it was needed for for the safety purposes and for the health purposes but hearing the testimony today i guess kind of made me think differently about this bill if we had voted on tuesday it might be a different outcome but hearing the small businesses and the business owners talk about how they would lose sales and consequently it may affect their business even more i do have concerns and if the fda is going to come out with something in the near future i think that that would be a better route to grow to go and the and the other thing that that made me question this is when i asked the young high school student that is representative eskars um uh in her in pueblo uh he um he he said that he was concerned with his family small business and and that for a young man to be concerned and come up and question that i'm glad you asked that question and also when i asked how many of the students in that high school does he think uh did vapor cigarettes uh he gave me a one percent amount so it's not that i don't care about the health issues but i do hear the small businesses and i think this that this will affect them greatly and when the fda does come out hopefully soon i hope that will remedy this issue so respectfully representative klingerschmidt i will be a no today all right any further comments representative klingenschmidt do you want to wrap up thank you madam chair i was hoping to wrap up before everybody said they were no i could have persuaded you with i had a killer closing speech i knew i could have gotten all of you you haven't voted but uh i haven't voted yet so you persuade them thank you madam chair i am concerned again we have products here that look like candy and this bottle doesn't even say nicotine on the bottle and adding four words that nicotine is an addictive substance uh that that nicotine is in the bottle at least you got to list it as an ingredient i think that's common sense not only that my bill would fix a truth in labeling error we've seen deceptive labels the health community is about that and by the way i believe in personal responsibility i believe in parental responsibility even teenagers ought to be taught read what's in the bottle before you put it in your body the problem is when they try to do that there's nothing on the label there's nothing to read if you're a parent and you're trying to protect your teen and you and you're careful and you read the labels but the labels are blank or deceptive then how can a parent take responsibility so i think there are conflicting principles at play here and i think we're enhancing a parent or a teen's ability to be personally responsible when we simply tell them what's inside the bottle i have talked to retailers who say they want guidance i don't believe federal guidance is coming in the next 90 days i don't think it's coming in the next year if it does that's fine as the bill is amended this would be repealed my bill is supported by the department and thank you for their help today my bill is supported and was initiated by the counties and i so grateful to have their support today and the doctors and the child advocates are all in favor of truth in labeling this is not an anti-liberty bill it's not hard for a business owner to put a sticker on a label in fact the responsible ones are already doing that and they're already using comparable language and so my bill would would narrowly bring into line those rogue elements in the industry that are mixing whatever in their kitchen and not telling people what they're putting in their bodies and i think that's needed colorado needs clarity the retailers need clarity the parents and children need clarity the hospitals need clarity there is no clarity and i don't think the feds are coming with it anytime soon and even if they do uh even representative ryden's amendment which passed would would fix that so i don't see the logic behind the opposition i'm still asking for a yes vote and hopefully my closing words have at least impacted if not changed a few hearts here thank you ma'am thank you and um represent clinton schmidt i'm going to be a yes vote on your bill um because i do think that it sounds like the federal regulations are not coming in if they do it'll still be a two-year period and then if there's a lawsuit it could be five or six years or more before we have any kind of federal guidance and um i do think it sounds as though many of the manufacturers are already putting labels on these bottles that contain warnings and contain the reference to nicotine um i think that they will be able to make the

IVKM7dp8s1Q,03-11-2014,2656,CO,getting ahead of myself representative young thank you i move house bill 1290 to the committee of the whole as amended with a favorable recommendation second okay house bill 1290 has been moved to the committee hole with the favorable recommendation by representative young seconded by representative schaefer and it is as amended miss berger will you okay mr burger would you please call representatives conte yes everett yes you know yes joshi yes landra yes mccann excused schaefer yes singer yes stevens yes tyler yes wilson yes young yes madam chair yes congratulations representative becker your bill passes 12-0 see you in the committee of the whole thank you very much everyone for your support all right our final bill on the agenda is senate bill 18 by representative hamner and representative young so there was an open date for me to vote okay i should have told you that i was just this bill shouldn't have any problems looks like you have samples here yeah i think are you gonna pass out cigarettes for us nicotine products okay representative hamner and young are you organized yet well thank you madam chair and committee thank you for hearing senate bill 18. i think we would all agree that we should follow current law about the distribution of tobacco products to minors and that that's not allowable in the state of colorado the complicating fact is that there are new and interesting and appealing products and we're going to pass some of these around because if you're like me you had no idea that some of these products were out there um they're being packaged and marketed in ways that are appealing to people children 18 and younger i think we all recognize that that's a very vulnerable age i have true confession i started smoking cigarettes at 17 which i never had so this is a really important issue to me personally but also as someone who cares deeply as as you do about young people and helping them make good decisions current it currently it's confusing to the retailers about some of these products that maybe are tobacco and maybe not tobacco but are nicotine and whether they're allowable to be sold to children under 18 or not so senability teen clarifies that for retailers and protects our youth and i'll let representative young make some comments while i have you pass this around oh and there's more representative young thank you madam chair and you have a couple of educators here so we can't uh uh avoid having show and tell so that's why we have uh items to take a look at and you know as representative hamner indicated you know i haven't been into the retail convenience stores to really seek out these products i don't use them so i was a little amazed when i began to look at what senator nicholson had put together and realize that the marketing has changed on tobacco and nicotine products and they don't look like what we used to see and they're not just cigarettes and was a little astounded earlier in the year when someone told me that cigars were favored by junior high students and middle school students and i just couldn't feature that until i actually saw how they were being marketed now and realized that we've had a sea change in the way tobacco and nicotine products are being marketed so and as representative hamner has indicated that i think there's while the law may be clear to lawyers it may not be clear to everyone else and you know sometimes that happens with our statutes i've seen that with dui legislation where actually lawyers weren't able to actually follow the law until we recodified it didn't actually make any substantial change to the law but made it so everyone could really understand what was permissible and what was not and so and by the way as those items are going around we need those back we're keeping an eye on you so but please do take a look at them and uh um so the intent of this um of this legislation is to make our statutes clear at a practical level at the street level so that everybody understands exactly what is permissible what isn't we want to make sure that that our children under 18 are not having access to tobacco and nicotine products or any devices that would deliver those products to them and so with that we'll entertain questions we have witnesses and that are coming to testify may be able to answer more technical questions for you but we'll try to answer them as best we can now are there any questions for our bill sponsor representative stevens thank you madam chair let me ask does this also include though for people who uh i say students but um youth under the age of 18 who are trying to quit so for example are they then barred from using nicotine gum are they barred from using anything under the direction of a doctor if they so chose to quit because we do to but we do tobacco and nicotine cessation programs in high schools and we we do target this age group because we if they have started we want to get them off uh and in some times there is a case for intervention so um would this how would this play into that representative hamner thank you madam chair and thank you representative stevens for it's a great question the bill does not uh does it does not include any changes uh to the prohibition there's no prohibition on regarding the sale of smoking cessation products that are approved by the fda okay so representative stevens oh good uh the other question then would be and there have been um i don't know the whole issue of uh european or chewing tobacco in terms of nicotine delivery but but wherewith and so i'm going to assume already these products are already out we have already outlawed all of those so we're just saying any other product under a different name that includes nicotine is this correct representative young yes that's correct and also in answer to your first question on page four of the re-engrossed version of the bill uh lines three through seven specifically respond and that was already in the in the statutes before but we're just expanding it so it's tobacco or nicotine for clarity represent a bland graph thank you madam chair does this include things like um you know the papers that people use to wrap make cigarettes so would be used with tobacco or nicotine products representative young representative lambgraf that's a great question that i do not have the answer to but hopefully one of our our witnesses will be able to answer that thank you representative hamner thank you madam chair um and thank you representative lanegraft for the question the bill language doesn't speak to the papers but it does include any electronic device that can be used to deliver nicotine including but not limited to electronic cigarettes cigars cigarrellos or pipes it doesn't speak specifically to rolling papers so that's a great question perhaps our bill director can answer that if you can't representative young and uh and actually thank you madam chair we've eliminated the word electronic from this so it's any device that can be used to deliver nicotine and so perhaps it does i think maybe our witnesses may be able to get confirmation on that but we removed electronic because not all devices that deliver tobacco or nicotine actually do so electronically so um that's true right i was just going to say it it may include the papers but you may want to clarify that's a good idea okay are there any other questions for our bill sponsors seeing none you have one two three four five witnesses signed up let's see for our for your bill and one is against do you have any preference for who you'd like to bring up young thank you man i'm sure we'll take the witnesses and support first please okay our first witness is april montgomery join us at the table and state your name and who you represent please for the record welcome and thanks for being here [Applause] i'm april montgomery and i'm here as a volunteer for the march of dimes in support of senate bill 18. um we've the march of dimes currently major thrust is the prevention of prematurity and tobacco and nicotine products are one of the causes of prematurity the as a matter of fact a few years ago the colorado department of public health in collaboration with the march of dimes did a study on attributable risk risk for prematurity and one of the major factors was tobacco use now i'm happy to report that the that has become less of a risk and there's fewer premature births due to tobacco at this point but there's still a fair number of them so what this bill would do would be again to add nicotine to those to the prohibition with tobacco products for children for individuals under age 18 what this will do will be to protect young women and their children who from exposure to nicotine there's also some evidence that not just tobacco products but that in animal studies that nicotine is detrimental to the development of the nervous system in those are animal studies not humans so it is important indeed to protect young women of childbearing age and their children from nicotine and tobacco project products thank you are there any questions for miss montgomery representative conte thank you madam chair i'm just wondering the little products that are going around in the baggies over here the tablets that people are dissolving in their mouth that contain nicotine and tobacco products have studies been done on that are the health risks any greater or different i'm not aware of the of any studies there may have been but i'm not aware of them representative thank you madam chair we just passed a bill for a prohibition of selling uh tobacco cigarettes to people under the age of 21 is that correct representative hamner may not know that representative young thank you ma'am john i don't think that's come to the floor yet i understand that it may be in process i think we did it representational i'm sorry madam chair my question is to you why is it 18 years of age and not 21. that statute thank you madam chair representative genele i don't believe that that bill has gone through the the statutes yet but it is uh both this bill and that bill are addressing the same part of the statute so if both bills are passed then there will have to be some harmonizing that will be done okay thank you hey are there any other questions for miss montgomery seeing none thank you for your testimony today thank you madam chair and thank you for the committee our next witness is gabe kaplan you could join us at the table please state your name and who you represent for the record [Music] good afternoon madam chairman and members of the committee uh it's a privilege to be here today i'm here on behalf my name is gabriel kaplan i'm the director of healthy living and chronic disease prevention at the state health department and i'm here on behalf of dr larry walk the executive director of the department and the state's chief medical officer and i'm pleased today to convey the department's support for this piece of legislation tobacco use remains the leading cause of death and disease in colorado and kills more than 4 300 of our citizens annually each year and costs our state 2 billion dollars in health care and our employers 1 billion and lost productivity each year we're beginning to understand now that smoking is actually uh also understood in the pediatric world as a pediatric disease over 80 percent of tobacco users first try uh tobacco before the age of 18 and many of them become addicted at this point in their lives and then have to have the rest of their life to struggle with this addiction and the consequences of it preventing youth initiation is the key to reducing the burden of tobacco in our state like the rest of the nation we've made great strides in reducing the use of tobacco and protecting our citizens from the toxic effects of secondhand smoke since the broncos last won the super bowl in 1998 we've facilitated conditions we've facilitated conditions that have reduced the number of smokers in our state by 200 000 this means that we will have fewer lung cancers down the road fewer deaths from such cancers and fewer incidences of cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease nicotine is a highly addictive component of tobacco products and such products that are available to youth now come in a myriad of forms including e-cigarettes chewable tablets flavored strips and there's even talk about other products such as nebulizers which could deliver this through non-electronic forms studies from the stanford school of medicine and others demonstrate that the industry has used candy-like flavors and tobacco products to appeal to youth and to create lifelong habits and dependence while youth smoking rates have dropped steadily along with adult rates in more recent years we've seen that this decrease has leveled out suggesting that we may be losing ground in our efforts to prevent tobacco initiation among youth the public health community believes that fewer that newer flavored products such as e-cigarettes are likely to contribute to youth addiction and nearly 37 percent of high school students in our last survey reported that they had already tried smoking and nicotine infused products research suggests that many youth who experiment with tobacco start with easier to use products such as flavored products these new nicotine products now emerging on the market are just one more potential gateway into a lifelong addiction to tobacco this bill reiterates the state's commitment to being the healthiest state and unequivocally emphasizes our intolerance of efforts by marketers and tobacco companies to lure our youth to a lifetime addiction of nicotine and tobacco we hope you can support this important legislation and we remind you that this bill really does three things first it reiterates the state's commitment to health by reiterating our commitment that youth not initiate smoking and use of nicotine infused products second it clarifies requirements associated with signage in the retail establishments and you'll be hearing uh testimony from a representative of the retail establishment in the retail industry talking about how they appreciate the clarification that this legislation will provide and finally it also makes clear that there are a number of products that are now emerging on the market that provide mechanisms to deliver nicotine not necessarily tobacco but they set up potential health problems for us down the road so we hope you can join us in supporting this important piece of legislation thank you for your attention and time thank you are there any questions for mr kaplan representative wilson thank you madam sharon thank you for being here you were talking about the rate of smoking dropping what what do you attribute that drop i thought it was the broncos but mr kaplan thank you madam chair and thank you representative wilson pretty sure the broncos although it's traumatic at times has had nothing to do with our smoking incidents in the state um however uh i think we had some early successes due to a number of factors i think conditions and policy and changes that were facilitated by the general assembly and the administrations of recent years created conditions which made it more challenging for individuals to smoke and encourage people who did smoke to sit uh to sustain from smoking and also gave other others pause from initiating tobacco i think legislation that the legislature has passed such as efforts to limit access to electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products also have assisted this and the policy changes such as increases in price through efforts like amendment 35 have made it more challenging for the youth to have access to the kinds of resources that would support the sustained commitment to smoking and so those factors together were resulted in associated with a drop in smoking among youth from the mid to late 1990s through to about the middle of the last decade and then we saw those numbers stall around the late parts of what i guess people now term the auths the first decade of the 2000s representative wilson thank you manager in any explanation i noticed the word enforcement was missing so if we pass this and say nothing mustn't do we depend on people complying with it what's the enforcement piece since right now it's illegal for 18 year olds and under to be smoking or using any kind of tobacco product where's the enforcement piece mr kaplan thank you madam chair and thank you representative wilson do the sponsors of legislation want to speak to enforcement as it is uh sort of provided and covered in the bill or i'm just inviting you i don't have representative young thank you madam chair i don't have statistics on that but i do know that there is current enforcement that there are some tickets that are written in fines assessed both for real retailers that that sell is someone underage and also to underage consumers who buy them so that's already a process that's in place in the statutes and and is enforcement albeit maybe not as vigorous as we all might want but it is it is enforced i'm not sure that's an answer to your question representative wilson on the fiscal note talk there's a thing about background and the department of revenue has a role in enforcement mrexcel wilson thank you madam chair and thank you again and my point being i'd only been in school for 40 years but i can count on one hand the number of citations issued to those who are supplying minors with cigarettes i see the same thing here we can say that we're going to keep nicotine away is there an improvement in the enforcement piece of this because if i'm standing on the street corner smoking a cigarette and i'm 14 years old i think i'm breaking the law or at least i could put the heat on who may have contributed to delinquency of a minor here what's the enforcement piece on this it's going to actually make a difference rather than make us feel good i don't know if you can answer that mr kaplan thank you madam chair and thank you uh representative wilson so there are provisions in the legislation uh regarding um the the penalties uh for providing and distributing and dispensing these products the department of revenue is the primary lead agency charged in the state to handle enforcement around the retail side the department of public health and environment also has a piece of support that comes from the food and drug administration which tasks us with also inspecting retail establishments to ensure that they comply with advertising and retail requirements associated with the sale of these products the fda and the department of revenue do issue citations to retailers who are not seen as being in compliance with this legislation i think that the rates of enforcement indicate that our retail partners are actually pretty good compliers with this requirement there is some research that suggests that obviously there are mechanisms but through which youth can access these goods through various mechanisms and strategies and they are successful from time to time um the actual enforcement of a youth smoking a product such as that is is the realm of law enforcement and not the realm of public health representative young thank you madam chair and at the bottom of the second page of the fiscal note i think you'll see that there have been the past two years have been approximately 300 violations of the existing statute that have been cited and i agree that that our retailers are are doing well with this but they probably could do better and i think you'll hear one of our other witnesses talk about the fact that the changes that we're making to the um to the statute here actually provide them the kind of clarity to even do better in that regard janelle thank you madam chair um two questions um when did this these types of tobacco products actually hit the market so to say so to say what year would you say they came on board and how fast is this growing from 2010 to 2012 to 2014 are we seeing this go up in single digits are we seeing this going up exponentially mr kaplan uh thank you man of chair and thank you representative janelle that's a great question uh we first observed the emergence of electronic cigarettes about three or four years ago in the state of colorado the state of colorado was actually targeted by a large tobacco company as a test market to test this product we've seen that early in the years of this product it was small small industrial manufacturers who entered this business line first and advanced and promoted these products but the larger tobacco retail companies have identified that this could be a potentially lucrative market and they've bought out many of those retailers and so now when you walk into a convenience store retail establishment if you see some of the more popular brands many of them are owned by the larger tobacco companies representative janelle thank you madam chair e-cigarettes i can understand but what about those chewables and those sticks and all those other things when did they come come into play mr kaplan do you know that uh i don't actually know the date that those products were uh introduced i know we began testifying uh on those products about uh four or five years ago i remember my colleagues who were coming to the capitol at the time to testify on behalf of those products and i know that the department was involved in testifying and legislation associated with the emergence of those products around dissolvables in particular uh about four years ago representative janelle last question and you've seen a steady increase in those sales or uh single digits double digits i'm just trying to see how fast growing thank you madam chair so uh we don't have the sale data uh that would be probably in the realm of the department of revenue uh that had would have greater access to that information through sales data there are uh data sources by which we could uh access those but they're through marketing companies like nielsen they're pretty expensive and we haven't looked at them yet uh we do have a survey in the field uh that actually is just being concluded and we'll be able to look at uh the youth utilization of these products uh we did not ask the serv these questions in 2008 because they weren't on our radar in 2010 we didn't have because of the downturn the resources to run that survey so we ran the survey uh in 2012 and 13 in high schools and middle schools and we added those questions and we should be having those results in april about and we'll be able to answer those questions and be happy to provide the legislature with the report on that thank you thanks okay are there any other questions for mr kaplan grifton conte thank you madam it's uh representative stevens did you want to say something risen two and a half percent just from 210 to 212. so about eight point about eight and a half percent of seniors were using the chewable uh the tablets we just saw and most young women now want to use it for weight loss i mean obviously that would be you can understand that so that's catching one representative young man i'm sure seniors meaning me or seniors many seniors in high school oh okay just checking so from 2 10 to 2 12. so you have about six five up to about an eight about eight or something it's it is among under 18. you'll see that it is growing representative conti i'm sorry that's okay thank you so much i guess i'm just wondering most of the products that i saw that were passed around commented that they were a combination of tobacco and nicotine why then would they not be covered under current statute representative conte i mean representative young sorry representative conte thank you and under the existing statute if they contained tobacco then in fact they would have been but we are not only considering products now that might contain nicotine only but also those in the future that would also not be a tobacco product but contain nicotine and that was not would not have been covered representative conte thank you madam chair so are any of the products that you passed around in the handy-dandy little sort of sealed pouch uh qualify under this or representative hamner uh thank you madam chair and thank you representative conte because that's why we're having this discussion to clarify um current law includes um that what's prohibited to under 18 is cigarettes and tobacco products so this is clarifying that these new products also pertain to this um to not being able to be sold to under 18 to people under the age of 18. represent county thank you madam chair can you point to particular which products i'm sorry maybe i didn't look thoroughly enough but i didn't see anything that didn't say that it had tobacco in it so to me all of those would be covered under the current statute or maybe i'm missing something is there something in there that wouldn't be covered that doesn't say that doesn't have tobacco in it something that's just nicotine only yeah i didn't see anything most of the dissolvables do say tobacco yeah yeah i think they do and representative young thank you madam chair again let me just say again representative conte that we're also considering uh looking forward so we're not in a re reactive mode that there would be products that would be nicotine only in the future well i i understand i'll look through to see if i can find it okay i just i just am wondering is this legislation in search of a problem or is there really a problem and or is the problem that we're not be able to enforce the laws that are already on the books ten years ago when i worked for department of revenue the liquor and tobacco enforcement agent agency that was part of department of revenue hired teenagers to actually go into stores to try and purchase liquor and tobacco products as a covert kind of an operation so um i know they do work really hard in enforcing these laws i'm sure they do and i'm sure i know that there are certain ways in which their hands are tied and i'm wondering if that's more the issue than what i'm wondering if this is going to fix the problem representative hamner um thank you madam chair and i do believe in and thank you representative conte that because there are so many new kinds of products these aren't the typical pack of cigarettes that everyone knew was you know not to be sold to people under the age of 18. these products are so new and different i think this is just the bill is clarifying that these new products fall under that category as well i think it's something that the retailers find helpful and is clarifying to our young people that these are also products that are equally dangerous as a pack of cigarettes so i think it's just clarifying representative schaefer thank you madam chair i think we've seen the tobacco industry be very creative and entrepreneurial in their marketing and their selling our attempts to sell and we're going to see new products with nicotine in them and i do believe we need to be proactive and get prepared for this when we consider the damages to young people of any kind of tobacco or nicotine use gripz and conte did you have another question well i guess i'm just wondering why did you find something i haven't yet but okay i'm trying to listen to it i'm just wondering couldn't couldn't this be handled through simply rule clarification through the department of revenue for the current cigarette marketers or something like that that might be a question for the bill drafter unless you guys can answer that but we already have legislation that outlaws everything that they're showing us okay mr kaplan thank you madam chair uh i think it's an excellent question and i i see your point representative conte i think the intent behind this legislation and one of the reasons that the public health community is attracted to it is what has been alluded to in the comments which is that this market is really rapidly changing we've seen it change so much in the last four or five years and we can already anticipate products uh that may be derived from tobacco or that really don't have to be derived from tobacco but that deliver nicotine either through an electronic cigarette or through a nebulizer or other kinds of delivery vehicles that may not have to have a tobacco label on them and therefore may cause confusion in a retail environment as to well is this something i can sell to an 18 year old or is this something that i can't sell to an 18 year old and so i think it's really by clarifying and really limiting the complete the confusion for the retailer uh it just makes for a much better environment for the retail establishment to be in business and and to know that they're in compliance with the law thank you madam chair just i just wanted to clarify just because there may be some loopholes here um with nicotine we have nicotine cigarettes that are gum that's available by prescription correct and that has x amount of nicotine in it are we going to get ourselves caught up in a situation here where you know you can sell a small amount of nicotine so many milligrams and it's okay but if you surpass that then it's against the law is this all nicotine containing products no matter what amount they have in them mr kaplan are these nicotine patches and things that are prescribed by doctors bought through pharmacies and not the same kind of product as these products that are sold at liquor stores and that kind of thing along with representational question so that's an excellent question i don't actually know if there is an age restriction on obtaining the product uh through a prescription and or whether you can get it over the counter if you are under 18 my understanding is you cannot if you aren't 18 obtain it over the counter and the legislation does have specific language saying that those products that are used for cessation that are approved by the food and drug administration the department of health and human services for cessation purposes are exempt from this legislation representative clarification nicotine patches are exempt from this mr kaplan you'd have to check with the office of legislative legal counsel since i'm not a lawyer but i believe the language does exempt them from this legislation we saw somebody wander in from legislative legal services so we might have to bring her up representative hamner thank you madam chair and we'll have to find the exact i don't have the re-engrossed bill in front of me i'm sorry but there is language that makes it very clear that if a product has already been approved by the fda it doesn't pertain to this legislation page four representative however nicoderm cq is i think i believe it's an over-the-counter product which is a nicotine patch and i don't see anything in just this brief bringing up this screen here that says you have to be a certain age to buy this representative thank you madam chair i think if we can continue with testimony i i hope that we have someone who can specifically answer your question representative general thanks thank you any more questions for mr kaplan representative wilson thank you madam chair i finally found what i was looking for it's been a while since i looked at the 18 code as a superintendent but the definition in current statute of tobacco product any product that contains nicotine or tobacco or is derived from tobacco and is intended to be ingested inhaled or applied to the skin any electronic device can be used to deliver nicotine i mean all these things are covered in present statute are they not i have our bill drafter who's up here well not our builder after but someone from legislative legal services would you like to join us kristen state your name and thank you are you representing thank you madam chair kristen forrestal from legislative legal services um i believe representative wilson is right the definition does the current definition of tobacco product does include nicotine products but um i believe the intent of this from senator nicholson's side was to clarify in statute because throughout statute we just say cigarettes or tobacco products and according to the builder after jennifer berman that that was confusing to people so she wanted to make sure that nicotine product was throughout the statutory sections so people knew it was including all these new products out there thank you and what about i think representative landgraf had a question about whether the papers could still be sold under this bill there was a lot of discussion about those types of products in the senate um it came down to even like soda cans that could be formed into pipes to smoke from which i think is beyond the scope of this bill and you could still sell a soda can to a miner but it's my understanding that if you had something that's specifically made for tobacco like rolling papers then you would not be able to sell them to minors thank you okay are there any other questions for our bill drafter or our legislative legal service expert actually okay thank you okay any other questions for mr kaplan seeing none thank you for your testimony today okay um the next person is greer bailey you could join us at the table state your name and who you represent for the record please just for a few minutes appreciate it come a long way thank you madam chair members of the committee greg bailey i'm the government affairs director for the petroleum marketers association convenience store association why we're here today is that we represent about 1200 of the convenience stores in the state um we're testifying in support of this bill for for a couple different reasons and i'll make sure i try to address your concerns representative conte um essentially retailers have between a 92 and 96 compliance rate uh currently according to the department of revenue and the synar reports every year with uh sales to tobacco and nicotine to minors not that eight percent is good and the retailers can do better and we we feel that this bill will help us especially a lot of our newer store owners which are first generation americans have a greater understanding of the law specifically on page four of the bill or i'm sorry not page four now uh page six of the bill where it says required signage that has to be posted at all retail establishments um this is this is a current law but the current law says it is legal for any person or 18 of age years of age to purchase tobacco products and non-conviction 100 fine may be imposed now it's very clear to me as representative wilson noted that tobacco products if a retailer would call me does include nicotine but for but for our newer store owners and their interactions with customers many of whom are trying in some cases against the law to try and buy tobacco products from us nicotine products while not clearly defined on the sign can be construed differently by the store owner and we don't want to put our store energies in a position where they're having to debate the merits of a nicotine versus a tobacco product anymore and so just as a general practice it's better for the retail community more regulatory surety and it's a better public policy for the state in order for us to continue to maintain that 92 to 96 compliance rate which we get matching federal dollars from for being for being above the sinai report criteria to uh to have that sign change just a little bit and so it includes all these nicotine products i think representative stevens is pretty accurate one she said is that as cigarette consumption declines our stores have seen a slight increase uh 48 over the last couple years in the sale of these otp products and that's another source of confusion for the retail community and that otp products and cigarette products are taxed differently and so again it's just by marrying these in the sales to minor statutes it provides a single a single way for retailers to say you know what i don't care what it is if it is nicotine if it's tobacco or if it's whatever nobody under the age of 18 should be ever having and so that's actually a benefit for the retail community and it's a benefit for the state to maintain that high compliance level for retailers um so part of the other questions so representative wilson was correct theoretically they are and actually in reality they are all currently covered but for me trying to explain that to a person who just got you know written up for a first time violation for selling a dissolvable nicotine strip this this provides more clarity because these signs are actually provided by the department revenue for free to the entire retail community and so these signs will be changed and then it's going to be a requirement as currently requirement for all these signs to be posted at the point of sale at the register and then getting rid of that the excise tax disparity you know that that argument saying well why is cigarettes taxed differently and why am i inspected differently for cigarettes rather than otp for those excise taxes and if they're treated differently why aren't they treated differently under the law and this this helps clear that up for us as well and so really really it's just a regulatory clarity issue looks like you raised some questions representative conte thank you madam chair first of all just so um i'm you know operating in clarity here otp stands for mr bailey other tobacco products thank you um in the world of alphabet soup that we live in it's always nice to have clarity um and so i guess again i seek only to understand why based on current statute could you not go ahead and put these signs in all of your retail stores and know that you are consistent with the law mr bailey we could um we could do it just voluntarily but the signage requirement is delineated in statute and so by adding the nicotine word in the same nicotine products even though under current law it is they're all dealing with the same things tobacco and nicotine products this this is a requirement that can help help hold retailers accountable for something that is important for the state and for the retail community and our joint effort with our colleagues in the health community to keep nicotine and tobacco away from minor so we really don't see this as a regulatory burden just a regulatory update to something we already do county final final let me just recap and see if i understand what's going on basically you have people in your stores that assume or are running on a possible false assumption that because of the signs that have been previously printed that they don't understand that cigarettes and tobacco includes any kind of product with nicotine and it's too big a hassle a corporate expense so whatever to do this out and if it's in statute then the department of revenue will do it for you is that it mr bailey okay representative young thank you madam chair i'd like to step in because actually the statute require currently requires the sign so if if they corporate if they did it as a corporate venture to change the sign they actually would be in violation of a requirement in statute so this provides clarity about what exactly needs to be on the sign so that everybody uses the same sign in the same way representative conte thank you madam chair who currently pays for those signs they can be mr bailey sorry manager um we can either produce them individually or that we can get them from the department of revenue representative wilson okay so no change thank you madam chair and as much as i enjoy passing legislation it seems to me i think representative connie was right the signs have been wrong all along the statutes been very clear whoever passed this statute were they were way ahead of us because they list all these products and nicotine and pipes cigarillos electronic cigarettes so if we pass this legislation the government will pay for the signs to update the signs and make sure that all the store owners are aware of the statute if we don't pass it we need to have a new sign anyway and make sure that all the store owners are aware of what the statute already says so i'm struggling with why we need the legislation and understand the the retail operators are the good guys in this my thing about enforcement is when it leaves that store walks out the door and hits the streets that's the enforcement part but i don't understand what's the difference whether we pass this or not we've got to have new signs because they've been in violation of this all along mr bailey it's um slightly inaccurate to say that this has been the way that it's been forever and ever because e-cigarettes haven't been around forever and ever and it was actually a representative ken summers who updated the statutes only um four or five years ago and added some of these electronic cigarettes to the current age to sales to minor statutes and so at that point it probably would have been better to update the signs at that point but we didn't and really what the retailers are are concerned about is transparency to consumers and that interaction and face-to-face between the clerks and that person who might not want a tobacco product but might want a nicotine dissolvable product and so being able to point to something that say the state makes me post that the state says you're not allowed to have nicotine along with and you're not allowed to have tobacco products and while you know and i know and everybody on the committee knows and the department of revenue knows that tobacco products do contain that definition does contain nicotine products it still doesn't it still helps being as transparent as possible at our point of sales and our retail establishments to your point about the penalties actually that not to bring up but but house bill 1263 the fiscal net on that representative canspiel does a very very good job of outlining the current enforcement penalties for things like sales to minors and the attempts of an underage person to try and buy tobacco products but i can tell you that the retail community shares your frustration with once that interaction leaves the store and you see that 15 year old kid walking down the street with a cigarette or whatever that the lack of enforcement and the lack of citations by law enforcement is is very very frustrating representative wilson thank you manager and i'm not badging you here i'm just i'm just really struggling with how more transparent can we be than the current statute it's extremely clear the problem is that the store owners have not been informed what the statute says all those products in this bill that i read unless i'm missing something are defined right here and if that was representative summers kudos to him because he was ahead of his time he addressed every issue that we're talking about now so what am i missing in this mr bailey i would say energy support in this legislation that adding the word nicotine to the signs is more transparent for the actual consumers and store owners who might not be as sophisticated to know that and then i would also assert that these statutes and these laws and regulations do continually need to be revised and looked at and it doesn't hurt the state at all to treat retailers like customers and periodically take an opportunity to remind us of the current laws and regulations represented wilson and then i'm going to be quiet any product that contains nicotine it can't get any more plain than that in current statute i completely agree with mister thank you i mean i i completely agree with that that's what it says gripson of landgraf thank you madam chair so so what this will really do is is force a new sign that adds the word nicotine mr bailey yes representative landgraf thank you madam chair so the fiscal note uh shows really no no fiscal but the signs are certainly going to cost something i would guess quite a bit based on the number of stores that will have to get new signs if the stores don't pay for them and the state provides them free there has to be someone there has to be a cost somewhere yeah mr bailey i know you don't work for revenue and you didn't put the fiscal note together but if you can answer that you can go on to the department of revenue website right now and download an actual um sign and a pdf format that meets the criteria of the legislation and there is nothing in that in the in the law that requires a certain amount of you know it's plaque carding or some sort of material or whatever so in all reality a single sheet of 11 by you know 8 by 11 paper whatever the criteria is you know taped up at the point of sales sinus sufficient rips and planned graph thank you so the various stores actually print them is what it sounds like you're saying the state doesn't send them to you you go down you download them yourselves mr bailey and main practice for the for the for the stores that choose to for the stores that choose to utilize the department of revenue site there's that we do have some stores that make a big deal out of not wanting to sell tobacco or nicotine to miners and so they they tend to take the current regulation and they um jazz it up to make it very very clear representative blandgraf okay so they can add the word nicotine now if they can jazz it up is that mr bailey there's something being missed here i'm at what am i missing it's so the so the so the regulation says that the sign has to say this it's in in reality it's no different than any other signs that we have to you know post on our gasoline pumps that say may contain 10 ethanol make made you know nfpa fire code whatever you know the wording is specifically picked for a reason and while it's certainly possible that a retailer could just choose to add the word nicotine the state regulation says the signs have to look like this mr bailey i know that i'm not sure where the genesis for this legislation came from i know you've been working on it is it because the retailers needed clarification that this bill was brought forward do you know that thank you madam chair um nobody in the real retail community senator nicholson's been very very great at working with both i think the health community and the retail community um tobacco cessation is something that's very important to her and you know she was kind of asking you know the you know kind of not so much in relation to this bill but what the community could together could continue to in light of these new products keep keep our compliance rates up and keep tobacco nicotine products out of the hands of kids but i can't genuinely say that our association asked her for this legislation now okay thank you representative hamner thank you madam chair and actually i've been involved in versions of this legislation probably for three years when senator nicholson was the senator for summit county she and i were both approached to carry legislation that probably went way further than this where this legislation goes but i just want to remind the committee that this is a real problem that these products are being sold to children under the age of 18 not intentionally i think because our current legislation is unclear and what i'm hearing from mr bailey is that the convenience stores would appreciate this level of clarification from us and that we'll hear from our health community that this is a step in the right direction to protect our young people and i think just looking at these products we had to get our reading glasses on and look at the ingredients to see if they actually had tobacco in them i think it's just an effort to be uh clear and to to you know just for more clarity on the part of the retailers and the youth trying to purchase these products representative conte final question i promise is it possible right now that as a chain of convenience stores petroleum marketers whatever you want to call yourselves that you could send out an email to all of your store owners with the link to the department of revenue site maybe even the specific link hyperlink that would take them to the sign that would add nicotine in the definition and that they could go to that link and print off a sign that would include the word nicotine can they do that right now today and is there a reason that they can't do that mr bailey yes we could send out a link to our 1200 members yes we could link the department of revenue sign but absent this legislation the law specifically requires this sign and this sign says tobacco products not nicotine representative so there is no sign currently thank you madam chair there is no sign currently that adds the word nicotine mr bailey not that's mandated by the state that's what this bill would accomplish for the retail community and not that the state even offers mr bailey i'm not aware of a sign that the state offers that it contains nicotine so that's what we're doing okay okay are there any other questions for mr bailey i feel kind of sorry for you mr bailey i'm just happy to be here supporting in tobaccoville thank you thanks for your testimony today hey our final witness and in favor of the bill donna viverette you join us at the table please and welcome state your name and who you represent for the records madam chair committee members my name is donna vivaret and i'm here representing the colorado association for local public health officials and jefferson county public health good afternoon and thank you for your up for the opportunity to speak on behalf of calfo and jeffco public health in support of senate bill 18 as we've already heard declines in youth smoking have been partially offset by the growing popularity of these kinds of products that you're looking at today they include little cigars flavored cigars dissolvable tobacco electronic cigarettes and hookah that's a word you haven't yet heard i think this this afternoon the 2012 national youth tobacco survey found that e-cigarette use among high schoolers doubled between 2011 and 2012 with use in the last 30 days increasing over 80 percent among middle schoolers and high schoolers hookah use by high school has increased by 30 percent in that same time period in the past year since the study's completion those of us working in the local tobacco control effort would say that the increase of the availability and use of these types of products and devices is alarming among youth i invite you to do an internet search on any of the terms including hookah vapor stones vapor electronic pens hookah sticks these are other nicotine and tobacco containing products and the accessories for their use are often come in colorful packaging are in self-service displays and are not regulated by the fda product flavors include traditional menthol as well as banana split cinnamon roll starbuzz acid all-american whiskey and party hearty peach because these products are not fda regulated nicotine content is often unknown or if it's listed it may be mislabeled an fda study to assess nicotine levels in e-juice the nicotine liquid that is used to smoke out of an electronic device found that some of these devices labeled as nicotine-free actually did include contain nicotine students conducting informal assessments of the availability and promotion of these products in several of our communities in jefferson county reported that it's relatively easy for them to get these products citing that some store clerks as we've heard believe that some of these may be legal to sell to minors senate bill 18 with its more inclusive definition of tobacco and nicotine products will make it clear for clerks that not only are cigarettes smokeless tobacco illegal to sell the miners but so are electronic cigarettes hookah dissolvables and other devices used to inhale nicotine i'm looking to see if i might deviate to some of the things that may be more relevant given this point in the discussion um on page three at the bottom at the bottom of page three in the bill the definition under the definition of tobacco 27 line 27 it says any electronic device that can be used to deliver nicotine to the person inhaling from the device and just note that electronic has been struck so that amendment in effect allows for the coverage of a number of non-electronic devices that were not formally covered under the legislation those non-electronic devices include hookah pipes and as mr kaplan stated nebulizers that are also non-electronic so that's an addition that senate bill 18 affords if it were passed with this amendment included i want to you know just talk a little bit about nicotine it's not a benign substance it's you know especially for adolescents with their developing brain nicotine is known to impact the maturation healthy maturation of the brain and it's highly highly addictive has a very short half-life just two days of use for a vulnerable adolescent can result in nicotine dependence um and and and potentially a lifelong addiction and and the health effects related to tobacco dependence um calfo and fanac and or calfo and jefferson county public health support this bill with the proposed amendments as it would assist local efforts to keep all nicotine products and the devices used to inhale them out of the hands of miners the amendments being proposed strike to strike the term electronic as it relates to devices effectively covers both electronic and non-electronic devices used to inhale nicotine making these illegal to minors thank you so much for your time and consideration of this important public health issue thank you other questions for miss vivaret representative wilson i thought you said you were going to be quiet that was on the last witness and i stayed quiet until the next witness came thank you thank you madam chair and and thank you for your testimony and trust me there's well i won't say there's no one any more rabid about that but i'm in the group against nicotine and kids smoking and so forth trust me on this so if they're if their use is increased then are we implying that the stores are not doing their job on keeping them from purchasing them since it's already illegal under the statute is that what we're saying miss favorite thank you madam chair wow there are a number of ways that um thank you representative wilson um there are a number of ways that youth get tobacco products certainly one of which is through retail outlets that may sell illegally this bill helps reinforce the message that that these products are illegal to you then they and they cover that additional set of devices that are non-electronic and used with great prevalence in our communities kids smoking hookah it's it's not a minor issue it's it's a major issue so they can currently purchase those things legally a hookah pipe for example so i'm not really answering your question definitively but i would say illegal sales still do happen the signage as addressed earlier would would potentially reduce some of that confusion about it but there are a lot of things that still can be done to reduce youth tobacco use including you know making these changes in in this current legislation and there's more that can be done as well representative wilson thank you madam chair and and i agree there's lots of things that could be done like banning tobacco try that one but that's not going to happen um but in the in the fiscal note each one of the areas talks about whether it's revenue expenditures the local government impact everything said minimal minimal minimal so if the impact is minimal why why i guess my question is why don't we simply enforce the statute there those are on the books because i'm not saying where's my witness go there i think the stores are doing an excellent job i think they're doing an excellent job once it goes outside that door that's where the problem is and for us to say local government impact is going to be minimal that's assuming they're not going to do anything about this either that's my frustration with it and i don't see changing a statute or making a new statute out of one that's already addressing what we're talking about totally is going to make a difference we should be addressing the enforcement piece of that so i don't think there's a question in that i'm sorry and i don't know if there's a comment there miss bibaret thank you madam chairman thank you representative wilson i actually would um beg to differ with respect to the language as it's currently proposed and amended that that the striking of the word electronic does make a difference that's different that's not under current legit it's not under the current law um the way the law is now so striking the word electronic covers those devices that are readily available to kids um and are being used like again hookah pipes and other devices that are not electronic so that that is it makes a difference at the local level and i i really am not equipped and i apologize for for commenting on the fiscal impact um or the or really even much of the enforcement my apologies representative conte thank you madam chair i'm looking on here by your own testimony most like virtually all of the hookah products have tobacco a small number of them also add nicotine so by striking the words cigarettes and tobacco as we do on page 3 line 12 as we do on page 3 line 16 as we do all over the place how is that would that not make a majority of the hookah products that are out there legal and simply the ones that contain nicotine illegal thank you madam chair if i understand correctly the issue has to do with the device is used to inhale so a hookah pipe does not contain tobacco but it can be purchased and used to smoke sure tobacco and other things familiar that i would like with hookah so i said i'm more familiar than i would like to be with hookah um so i'm surprised i don't know my understanding is that striking again the word electronic is a separate section from that definition so that previously or currently i guess um currently um a young person could purchase a hookah pipe and use it now yes they by law would not be able to purchase hookah tobacco known as shisha but they can have a hookah pipe and get their hands on you know tobacco via other means so maybe a marginally beneficial um addition in terms of the the current statute but in in the eyes of the folks who are working in the field we see so many young people using hookah and and going to hookah bars even under 18. so we're we're hopeful that you would consider this is a beneficial component of this bill any other questions for miss baberet representative shaffer thank you madam chair thank you miss beverett for coming in thank you miss vivret for coming in from jefferson county uh thank you for your efforts to reduce these habits among our children i've i'm looking through your exhibit here and all these manufacturers r.j reynolds arriva jackpot camel are they all available especially these little tablets are these sold in convenience stores the ariva and this is the type of dissolvable you're talking about is that correct it's not electronic is that correct it's favorite thank you madam chair and thank you um representative schaefer the um the definition and i apologize i'm not as uh vassal with the legalese of the bill but as i understand it the way that the definition of tobacco reads there's part a which has to do with um so on page three it says you know a product that contains nicotine or tobacco or is derived from tobacco and is intended to be ingested or inhaled or applied to the skin of an individual and then the second part is any device that can be used to deliver nicotine to the person inhaling from the device so line number pardon me do you have a line yes uh 27 on page three and uh number uh line number one oh the device is can be used to deliver right on line number 27 page three and then on to page four line lines one and two electronics so i'm sorry can you repeat your question please i apologize representative thank you madam chair no i am thank you i um these are examples of dissolvables right right yes and i could purchase these at my local or my teenager could go buy these at the local mobile station or any other station his favorite thank you madam chair um and representative schaefer um there's great variability in their in their uh in their presence in in local retail outlets there's i know if i if i heard correctly i heard that um senator nicholson was able to purchase all of the dissolvables in a store in netherland many diverse products are available some places you see again electronic cigarettes and other devices you see you can see you can purchase hookah pipes for example in a gas station um they are it's diverse it's yeah okay thank you very much okay are there any other questions for miss vigorette seeing none thank you for your testimony today we have one final witness against the bill mr hours would you join us at the table please and say your name and who you represent [Applause] good afternoon madam chair my name is rj hours and i'm with the american cancer society cancer action network and i'm here today to speak in opposition to senate bill 18. but first i want to say on behalf of my organization acs can and our tobacco control partners i want to sincerely thank representatives hamner and young for their work on tobacco control and their concern about the use of cigarettes and tobacco products and nicotine products by the young people of colorado i also want to say we we deeply appreciate their efforts on on this the american cancer society cancer action network uh does now and has previously held concerns about the potential unintended consequences of senate bill 18 it's our position that these changes are are not necessary from a public policy or a public health perspective at this time among the tobacco control community acs can has chosen not to support senate bill 18 as it was introduced in the senate and amended in the senate our partner organizations are neutral on the bill so that's just one distinction there i want to thank the sponsors again for bringing this issue of youth and tobacco and nicotine forward and uh with that uh thank you madam chair there any questions for mr hours i was just you know represented schaefer well thank you man i'm sure i was just wondering mr hours why are you opposed to senate bill 18 given all the work you've done to prevent more minor use mr owers matt thank you madam chair representative schaefer we believe that current statute does adequately include coverage for the products that that we do deal with some of the alternative nicotine containing products that you all have had a look at today to my knowledge the nicotine there is derived from tobacco some of these dissolvable products even contain tiny flecks of tobacco um so we we believe the current definitions would would cover that adequately thank you so mr hours um you mentioned part of the reason you're against it is because of unintended consequences what would what kind of unintended consequence could there be for clarifying the law madam chair there are products i know hookah was mentioned a few moments ago there are combustible products available that do not contain uh tobacco or they're not tobacco products they don't contain nicotine and that's just one example of something we wouldn't want to see perhaps de-emphasized as something for youth we also with some of the proposed language as was alluded to earlier by representative conte i believe there are about 28 instances where the word cigarette is would be deleted from statute by this bill if passed we believe that that keeping terms like that of current products as well in front of the consumer in front of retail clerks etc is important in that the importance of of educating youth and others about the dangers of tobacco not be lost through omitting current products uh while trying to incorporate newer products and i know in the senate the word tobacco was reinstated uh and would remain in state law but we we still do have that concern about cigarettes being omitted in the future so you'd be happy if cigarettes was put back in he would support the bill i couldn't go so far as to say we would be able to support the bill but we would be much more relieved if a word like cigarette was left in statute thank you representative conte question for the bill sponsors if what we're seeking is clarity in the statute why is cigarette continually been stricken representative hamner representative young thank you madam chair and i just want to assure the committee that this is the first conversation that i've had with the american cancer society and would be willing to visit with them and see if there is some way to amend the bill that would also meet the needs of what happened in the senate so i i can't directly answer that question today great thank you are there any other questions for mr hours thank you for your testimony today thank you madam chair thank you okay that concludes the list of people who've signed up to testify on senate bill 18. is there anyone else in the room that would like to testify who's not signed up seeing none the witness phase is closed are there thank you available chair members uh you know that we've had a lot of questioning about the bill and current statutes i reflect back to my first year in the legislature i ran a bill not related at all to tobacco use it was a dui bill it was a simple recodification of the current statutes and what does that mean it means that we analyze the situation at street level and realize that our constituents our citizens could not really understand the laws as they were written and we didn't make a substantive change to the laws but we were organizing them who were those citizens that were drivers certainly but it was law enforcement it was a criminal offense it was da's it was judges and sometimes we spend so much time here looking at our bills and looking at the statutes we assume everybody else understands them to the depths that we do and in fact that isn't always the case and i think today what we've heard is that in fact a large number of people in our communities don't really understand what our statutes say around this and and this bill while it does make some substantive changes really does try to make an effort to clarify our intent and our intent is that we do not want children under the age of 18 to have access to tobacco and nicotine products and hopefully this bill you will agree in fact does that kind of clarification and will provide our retailers and others with the clarity that they need to do a better job of ensuring that our children don't get those products thank you madam chair and i want to thank everyone who came to testify for and against the bill today and for all of you for listening and asking really great questions i was really impressed with all the questions and um i guess i'm um also wishing that we could do a little more with enforcement and i appreciated representative wilson's comments there i do want to call you your attention to a part of the bill that doesn't um doesn't prohibit a local community from taking action in addition to what is seen in this bill and i think it's one of those situations where you know should the state make the change or should we empower the local counties and cities and towns to go beyond the scope and the bill does allow that to happen i encourage them the local decision makers to do that to do what is necessary to adequately enforce the policies and the laws that we pass as a state but i do believe that what this bill does it offers clarifying language and i i think it also raises this issue to a new level of awareness and i certainly hope that our local elected officials take it to heart as well so thank you we're trying to see if representative mccann wants to come vote but i i was uh sort of surprised when the american cancer society came out today against the bill i do think mr ours makes a really valid point i think the street term is cigarette and you know there may be a convenience store clerk who doesn't understand maybe that a cigarette contains tobacco products so i think for second reading maybe that would be something i appreciate representative hamner's willingness to work on that and i'm sure representative young as well so i think she's the only member so we can take a brief research uh mr or representative young would you like to move your bill it would be to the committee the whole thank you madam chair i move senate bill 18 to the committee of the whole with a favorable recommendation second okay we're going to take a brief recess to see if we can get representative mccann over here to vote she's presenting a bill yes public health and human services will now come back to order we had a brilliant thought by our two bill sponsors to open up the amendment phase again so the amendment phase is open and we will lay it over to work on an amendment regarding what the american cancer society is concerned about and then for action at another meeting so did you just learn something else we're all about collaboration all right so with that public health and human services is adjourned all right i'm outta here
hHLrN4fXX58,03-17-2010,1202,AZ,read the please oh yes please read the names and i'm sorry i didn't have you do that last time that's okay since mr lopez made those chatting comments uh madam chair for

comment if i was reading this correctly there's 30 currently there are 31 members on the committee um just an observation i i can't imagine having that many people on a committee adding one more

legislation is brought to our attention by the tobacco enforcement unit in our office of course we enforce the tobacco settlement and enforce uh youth access to tobacco statute so yeah this is a battery powered device that uses vapor deliver nicotine uh to smokers and it's a relatively new product and so it's a loophole in our existing statute we thought it was appropriate that the legislature make a statement that this type of product which is marketed as i guess as a way to wean people who are smokers away from cigarettes but it's also marketed to children in that it comes in various flavors and you can get them in a shopping mall uh kiosks and that sort of thing we want to make it clear that this is not an appropriate product for miners in the state of arizona so we ask

W5uEMz6GzIg,01-19-2010,1144,AZ,this is madam chairman members of the committee for the record my name is flora sarder and i am the research intern for commerce and economic development senate senate bill 1053 prohibits a person from knowingly selling or furnishing electronic cigarettes to a miner prohibits a miner from knowingly accepting or possessing electronic cigarettes and defines electronic cigarette as a battery-powered device that provides a vaporized vaporized solution of nicotine a violation of the prohibitions is regarded as a petty offense madam chairman members of the committee i'd be happy to answer any questions before before anybody does i didn't bring the computer one bill and so i don't have a list of who wants to testify so if anybody who wants to testify would just put it in writing like we used to do or let me know if you can come up and we'll do it afterwards i'll make sure i have the computer with me from now on so thank you other questions for flora unless you can get it for me okay thank you well i know greg stanton is here i'm sure he's oh senator alan do you want to speak to your bill before we have greg come up oh thank you madam chairman well it was brought to me um i had no idea that there were electronic cigarettes on another galaxy far far away when i was a little girl we had these candy cigarettes we played pretend but this is not really play pretend and i was very very taken back and would be happy to sponsor this and everybody that knows me knows how bad i really how much i really dislike my husband smokes so much so let's don't start these kids off trying to develop a bad habit thank you senator ellen truth the um candy cigarettes didn't have nicotine that's right he's have nicotine that's right greg stanton from the attorney general's office brought the bill please speak to us madam chair and greg sent from the attorney general's office with me is nicole harris who was one of our attorneys in the youth access uh uh division of our upper office the only thing i want to add to what staff had said about this issue is that these things these electronic cigarettes which probably are better called nicotine delivery systems um they come in various flavors chocolate mint uh fruity flavors uh et cetera they're sold in kiosks and over on over the uh over the internet so youth right now have great access to them and that's the exact point of this is say this type of product uh should not be available to uh uh to youtube added to our youth access uh statute we do have a little show and tell going on as the senator is looking at it it looks like a pen other versions of it actually look like a cigarette if you were to puff on that that one's ready to go if you uh enjoy i'm not a smoker myself but it would light up the front of it would kind of light up and it would look physically like a uh like a cigarette um uh greg where do they um i mean is it do they come preloaded or can are these reusable or once you use it once okay son excellent question you can unscrew that and a portion of it you would plug in and then a portion of it with the nicotine would be replaceable uh and then you put it back in there so parts of it are you have to continue to buy the the product a part of it is uh permanent in fact they doing my holiday shopping i was in the mall kiosk and saw it and went over to kind of ask you questions at least the one that i uh saw uh ran about 129 dollars so they are they are fairly uh expensive i don't know how much replacement parts uh are at least that's the initial uh the initial cost of them but yeah they are sold in places where children would have easy access to them it has different flavors but at all it all has it all has nicotine in it correct it's it is in some cases marketed as a way to sort of wean yourself adults who are active smokers to wean themselves off smokers but obviously when you're uh have different flavors uh to it uh intentionally or not uh it certainly is attractive to uh to teenagers and younger folks and that's what we want to get at in this issue but does it have less nicotine than a cigarette i just wonder nicole who may know more on that i don't know the answer to that question it does the cartridges that you can buy you can buy them in different nicotine levels so from regular to light and they're supposed to have one cartridge it doesn't contain nicotine but it may contain a little bit so that explains the weaning off since we continue to come back and and add more um items to the list of what cannot be marketed or sold to children as the market changes have you thought about making doing an amendment and adding nicotine products to this so every time something new comes on the market we don't have to come back and change the law or they get our products containing nicotine i think uh a man of chair uh i think at least from the attorney general's office perspective we would happily uh support such an amendment uh man chairman i think that we would need to review what they are and certainly i don't like to see children smoking cigaret or any kind of tobacco a lot of young people uh when they start to play ball i start this chewing business etc so that was actually my point since we've already done this with chewing tobacco another if we just add a category in addition that says nicotine containing products then we've covered all of them before the marketplace comes up with something new because the issue is because this wasn't specifically um against the law then they've been able to sell it so we would cover a lot by adding that something like that in addition to the language so senator fisher okay did you want to say something and you're not sure again for sure yeah madam chair and greg don't we already have um statutes uh in prohibiting inhalants and how come this couldn't be um taken care of under that statute you know because i know there's other things um i know there's an incense out there now that kids are buying to uh get high on okay i don't i'm going to turn it over to the expert on that question madam chair and senator for sure i think we we decided to include this in the youth access because it's similar to a cigarette um it's kind of grouped in with a cigarette although it's electronic it contains nicotine nicotine is derived from tobacco so we kind of wanted to keep those all together that's why we decided to just include it under our youth access law which we do go out and do inspections and so we could do inspections for sales of this product also so madam chair this this couldn't come under something like like where we have prohibited them from you know selling paint or uh some of these other chemicals too it probably could but i we didn't look into that route i didn't even consider that route we kind of just considered okay okay thank you hey um other questions okay we do have um senator payton has his computer he will he will read people who want to come up and speak but i wanted to i wanted to have tim baskey come for the american heart association did you want it you wanted to speak okay thank you madam chair members of the committee my name is tim baskey with the american heart association uh the american heart association we're taking a neutral position on senate bill 1053. it's a position of the american heart association that these devices should not be sold until the fda has a chance to properly evaluate the products and deem whether they're safe for consumer use and to our understanding that it's not happened yet we do understand though that for the fda we do understand though that while the fda continues its efforts to enact tougher our regulation of this product the oversight of electronic cigarettes is certainly warranted many brands of these products are found to possess known carcinogen and the products all result in the release of unknown elements in the form of vapor or smoke more directly the use of electronic smoking devices can serve as a mechanism to maintain a smoker's addiction as well as initiate new smokers to the destructive habit many electronic cigarettes are marketed with you foreign flavors as have been discussed and flavored tobacco products pose a particular threat to young people um more importantly though the american heart association are is concerned regarding the permanent use of electronic cigarettes and the threat it has to our smoke-free law or clean indoor air law since these devices are marketed to mimic the appearance of a cigarette it could cause stress for the owners of those businesses if they're not sure if someone is smoking or not as well as though for any enforcement when they come in if they recognize that this is a smoking if they're actually smoking a cigarette or an electronic cigarette so once again the american heart association we are neutral on this uh given the fact that we would rather wait to have these products available to consumers until the fda had a chance to and that actually doesn't make any sense to me that it would be that you would be neutral on something we're talking about youth access is something that you've clearly stated is dangerous whether the this doesn't undo what the fda is going to do it might be really odd that you wouldn't say no matter what the fda does and hopefully they will do it it will be outlawed completely where it's going to keep children away from this and i understand where you come from that and our belief is that by providing uh saying you know 18 or older or restricting access to 18 or younger are you making this legitimate a product when the fda still hasn't claimed this is a legitimate product for consumer consumption so is the state granting this as a legitimate product when the fda hasn't even weighed on on that fact yet yes and for sure a case i i guess i'm sure what you're saying is by by making this prohibiting this to youth we're kind of putting a stamp approval on it for adults is that the position you're kind of taking for sure i guess and or the american heart association position is that right now that this hasn't been deemed safe for anyone to use adult or a child just when i read the bill i don't see where it says it's safe for anybody but it just says you can't sell it to a child it's not illegal to sell it right okay any questions i i do have a question he brought up the i'm sure he brought the clean air act and i don't know if it's necessary for him or maybe for greg so someone could use could we have a statewide ban on smoking and restaurants and so forth and so on so someone could smoke one of these in one in a restaurant without violating that do you want to come back up thank you tim um madam chair uh senator for sure and i think uh the folks from the healthcare community uh uh would probably verify this i think the honest truth is that we don't there haven't been definitive studies on exactly what smoke is being emitted from these electronic uh cigarettes and so there hasn't been the test case about whether or not this would be in violation of the state uh uh smoking ban and not having to talk to the attorney general on that particular question i'm not sure what official i have a sense of what he'd probably say on that but uh we haven't taken a definitive position whether or not someone's smoking these in public because you do admit smoke uh with the violation of the state uh uh state uh smoking smoking ban maybe restaurant owners in the uh in the room may have a different uh opinion [Laughter] all right thank you thank you okay um we have dwayne huffman in case needed from representing department of health services wait joined up and that he was neutral on the bill as department of health service that was only if needed but there was there was a gentleman there was a colby bower representative representing american cancer society i will have kobe in a minute there's a there was another constituency buffalo yeah he did not need to speak oh for the record would you just read it against i'll read them all just that one we've got the other buffalo rick galener representing himself um is against the bill not wishing to speak is he here he doesn't want to speak anyway okay well kobe bauer american cancer society come on up he does wish to speak he's also neutral on the bill thank you madam chair for the record my name is colby bower and i'm representing the american cancer society cancer action network and we represent the american cancer society on policy issues like this i'm going to come up here and fly the big neutral flag also very very for very much the same reasons that the american heart association has for for being neutral but i do want to clear up uh some things and just sort of walk the committee through because i don't think this is the first time we're going to see e-cigarettes issue come up and so i wanted to educate the committee a little bit on what they are you guys have all seen the product um these things are being aggressively marketed right now if you check your your spam folder in your email box it's probably full of that and some other pharmaceutical products uh but and of course they're in the mall kiosks and being aggressively marketed also to kids i also i want to take the opportunity to uh to recognize senator allen's history on issues like this and we certainly our neutrality is in no way uh trying to um take away from your intent on this we think it's certainly a noble goal to to keep these out of the hands of kids but i do want to say that um similar uh to mr vasquee um there's no evidence this is that these products are safe for anybody and i think that's a moral dilemma that this committee and perhaps the body needs to figure out the fda has done some some very small lab tests on two of the products including the enjoy product that was passed out earlier they found carcinogens they also found antifreeze and also nicotine so you know the question you should maybe ask yourself is does this committee come back and say we think it's okay for adults to inhale antifreeze and not kids or vice versa and to the fda regulation i know there was a few questions on that i think it's a very relevant topic the fda regulates pretty much everything from lip gloss to dog food to anything you put in your body or can be accidentally put in your body by way of consumption and yet these the makers of e-cigarettes have not submitted to fda testing currently they're in a court battle with with the fda the fda is attempting to regulate them uh much in the same way that they regulate other drug delivery devices but they uh and and currently a judge ruled that they cannot regulate them as a drug delivery device leaving the door open for them to regulate them as a tobacco product even though they don't really contain any tobacco they just contain chemicals derived from tobacco which i would like to point out to the committee also opens up a whole great pandora's box if it is in fact a tobacco product should the state be taxing it like we tax other tobacco products should we be regulating it uh in terms of enforcement like other tobacco products those are just some issues that i think are going to come forward and on the clean indoor air ban the american cancer society cancer action network feels that these should be implicitly included in any clean indoor air uh laws that there's nothing really written into our current one i'm not sure how how the the state will want to move forward with that but we would certainly support any sort of bill that would include these explicitly in our laws so with that i want to leave some some time for questions i can also tell you what other states have done the attorney general in oregon for instance has banned these products via court order essentially any non-fda approved nicotine delivery device um and then and then another organization campaign for tobacco-free kids which is probably on the cutting edge for keeping tobacco out of the hands of children has recommended that state legislatures actually take a proactive approach and pass laws banning all non-fda approved nicotine delivery devices that's not necessarily our position but i do want to throw that out there to the committee and i'll be happy to answer any questions but you said there's no nicotine in these though no there is there there absolutely is nicotine in them in fact and in in there's just no tobacco i mean nicotine is a naturally occurring chemical um it's actually in quite a few fruits and vegetables um it's just really concentrated of course in tobacco uh that another chemical is also in the e-cigarettes is derived directly from tobacco although technically there's no tobacco in them so it you know i like to tell people they're sort of operating in this gray area it's not a tobacco product they have not submitted uh to fda testing you know if you think about the patch and the gum all those other nicotine replacement products those are all fda approved and those are regulated for consumer safety and e-cigarettes is not submitted to those testing so we don't know what they do long-term we just know they contain things like antifreeze what's in what is what's in the um patches that's different than what's in here for the fda to have chosen to regulate the patches and the gums well it's not the fda is attempting to regulate e-cigarettes right now and it's it's currently in federal court on how they can regulate it whether they regulate it through like a consumer product or whether they regulate it as tobacco well that was the question i was asking if the patches don't have tobacco either right the gum doesn't have tobacco either yet they've already chosen to regulate those why would why wouldn't this the fda why wouldn't this have been automatic under that same category the fda is suing to make that happen it just it it just hasn't happened yet i mean excuse me the fda is not suing e-cigarettes assuming the fda the fda attempted to regulate them okay and e-cigarettes said no we don't fall under any of your categories and it's currently in federal court then there's issues too about whether the fda should be regulating some herbal products and vitamins that and other products on the market that can be very dangerous to people and there's no regulation on any of those as well okay senator for sure yeah i'm sure part of the part of my question was answered so in that regulation so that the gum and the patch those things are prohibited from being sold to minors also yeah and and in fact there's even a product out there nicotine gel which is sort of a novel product where you just sort of rub it on my canvas they're actually regulated by the fd they submitted to testing and are properly regulated and the fda regulates pretty much everything i mean you know whenever you know you hear about these dog food scares because there's i mean that's the fda i mean they regulate everything and yet this is a product explicitly designed for a consumer to put into their body into their lungs and the fda has not done any testing because they haven't been allowed to hey other questions it's probably too much information but actually it's extremely helpful i i offer myself as a resource for for any member that wants to move forward with amendments um you know i would echo uh madam chair your sentiment that we should probably be more inclusive the marketplace uh is a really dynamic thing and you have everything from uh e-cigarettes to the nicotine gel uh infused water now being sold in arizona um so there's lots of great products out there to keep people hooked on nicotine but i offer myself as a resource should anybody need me thank you questions hey i believe that's everybody who has signed in um senator training will you move the bill please yes you want to move the bill okay go ahead okay i move senate bill 10 53 with the due pass recommendation thank you if there's no further discussion please follow the rule and chairman explaining my vote uh i do appreciate the information that which has been brought forward today the fda in my opinion does not have a particularly sterling reputation in the uh ability to act in a very timely manner i i just find it appalling that we're waiting for the fda to approve these but i do appreciate that the testimony has been helpful and with that i don't die madam chair quick explanation i support the bill and vote i but i'd like it noted that this is not intended to validate the legitimacy of this product as being safe for anyone so please note that hi given senate bill 1053 you do pass recommendation members for the first committee hearing we are complete thank you very much congress committee is adjourned
WNbqVPxju3s,3-12-2015,3022,AK,like to rewind to the pilot episode of department presentations to this committee when commissioner davidson and i described the department areas of primary focus for the coming year and she outlined the first being access to health care second child welfare third developing tribal and federal partnerships and uh fourth improving the health status of alaskans and i spent some time going through seven areas of opportunity and then finished that by uh saying and implementing the healthy alaskans 2020 plan will be part of the means to that end so i want to provide a little more detail of that today um i feel like after tuesday i need to before you go further i just wanted to recognize that representative foster has joined us we have a full committee um before i go any further after tuesday's hearing i feel like i need to distinguish healthy alaskans 2020 from healthy alaska plan i know the alaska and alaskans can get a little confusing at times but we're all moving in the same direction in terms of healthier people in a healthier state i do feel a little compelled uh with all due respect to my partners in the uh the department that the term healthy alaskans was one that we were using even back in the hickle administration i have a copy here of healthy alaskans 20 2000 uh so it is something that has been around for a while um next slide um healthy alaskans 2020 though is quite distinct from healthy alaskans 2000 and healthy alaskans 2010 in a number of measures uh and i think the first is that this is really a state tribal partnership the effort has been co-organized and co-led by the division of public health and the alaska native tribal the the right direction right now and this this scorecard is in the back of your uh packet i believe um the the six where we've achieved i want to stress though uh it doesn't mean that we can anyway relax health is a part of the biologic systems that we're all representing and oftentimes these are systems with a lot of moving parts and we recognize that if we are not vigilant that we could actually lose ground on some of these measures and i'll just use as an example youth smoking for instance we've made tremendous progress and we don't want to lose that that those gains it's important to note that these indicators don't cover everything we do in the division of public health this really was a statewide process that incorporated partners outside of government and that a number of the measures are really outside of the scope of what we do in dph it makes an exciting group though because we really have worked together to be bureaucratic silo busters and to look at how each of the organizations that are involved and each of the sectors can best play their hand the best to move us all in the same direction i should also point out that uh this doesn't necessarily address new and emerging issues uh for instance during the discussions i don't recall that the possibility of marijuana legalization ever came up so there are things that are very high on our radar screen that you won't see here next slide this graph i recognize is very complicated it's one reason why you have it as a handout also the intention though is to demonstrate how the advisory team has grouped the indicators to address broad topics such as the outcomes of longer and better life and into health factors including healthy behaviors access to clinical hair care social determinants of health which are things like economic health of our communities and the physical environment another difference with healthy alaskans 2020 is we don't have a book what we do have is a website uh our feeling was that oftentimes reports like this can be useful but they oftentimes wind up on shelves and they are not living documents so you can track the progress of healthy alaskans 2020 at ha2020.alaska.gov and you can find updates on the performance data as well as description of evidence-based strategies to achieve the targets as well as list of actions undertaken who are the key partners as well as state and national resources next slide please the partners involved in this have already described how they've used this effort to help guide their strategic planning and to develop performance improvement plans that can guide what they do best the ongoing process will also generate accessible data to quantify the problems and progress healthy alaskans has provided a focal port for understanding community priorities for selecting strategies to improve health and to and for leading efforts among the partners including the alaska wellness coalition the uaa behavioral health alliance recover alaska the all alaska pediatric partnership and the juno suicide prevention coalition as well as the work we do in the department of health and social services as well as anthc which just having come from there i can say that was part of our annual evaluations for a number of our leaders so to summarize the the work to date healthy alaskans 2020 has identified health priorities set targets and selected strategies to achieve those targets it's uh actually a whole lot of work that i feel uh i'm underrepresenting in only about 10 minutes particularly the work that many of the partners did over this time the current focus is to make identify lead partners so that we can be sure that all of our efforts are aligned and that we continue to work together i'd be happy i think i'd be best to stop at this time and take any questions you you have uh on the process and we have some providers from the division waiting to speak on the the other topics but both jill's been very intricately involved in healthy alaskans 2020 with the advisory council so either one of us would be happy to take any questions you have great questions uh let's start on slide four which was had health equity there can you define how you are dealing with the guiding principle of health equity and how that drives the process um yes uh mr chairman and uh i'll defer to jill if she has anything to add but i'll uh start by saying part of the process that went into uh identifying the 25 priorities we're looking at areas where some parts of the population have better health than others and in particularly particularly we focused on inequities uh between alaska native people and uh other alaskans so that's why uh particular for example you'll see uh suicide was an issue that we didn't uh back down uh from a very difficult problem and one that our tribal leaders are struggling with and making some progress with so it it's better health status is that what we're talking about in equity or is it better or is it access to um health care or health facilities i'm just trying to figure out equity sometimes gets to are whether it's um but alcohol and drug use is 15 and and but it doesn't have 14 alcohol induced deaths or any of the things on child abuse or any of those aren't included in that i'm i'm trying to figure out how how that works sure for the record my name is jill lewis i'm deputy director for the division of public health and i will try and address your questions mr chairman the numbers do correlate to the 25 leading health indicators and in some cases those indicators are very directly related to a particular health behavior or social and economic factor like for example tobacco use number two and three are very specific uh for increasing the percentage of high school students who have not smoked and increasing the percentage of adults who currently do not smoke so just showing that alignment in some cases it's very specific and so those are shown mostly in the lower portion of this grid and at the top the ones that you see up there are ones that are more general across categories of health factors and really focus on their overall health outcome for example number one is the rate of cancer deaths in the state and that has every uh is directly related to the length of life rather than a specific one of the other health factors or policies and programs and and can you explain to us how this would be used i mean are we looking at i mean on the far left is health outcomes health factors and um policies in this program and then those lead into those other two and i'm just trying to figure out how the flow chart works or are we looking at the left-hand side and then trying to figure out okay what are health outcomes length of life and quality of life and then that those those eight specific ones that are targeted to that so how would you use this in the collaboration i mean would you look at quality of life and then you would be identifying those four things as target um to address well mr chairman the portion on the left with the arrows pointing up indicate that you know it in order to address the full spectrum of health to get the best possible outcomes you have the policies and programs first that influence the health factors those health factors influence your health outcomes so that it's building and the health factors are the portion in the middle that are listed out in groups the four main groups being the behaviors the clinical care the social and economic factors the physical environment and if you don't address all of that you aren't going to be able to reach those health outcomes if you if for example we had no leading health indicators that dealt with social and economic factors then that would be a definite gap the purpose is of showing it to you in this grid is really sort of to illustrate the full array in the full spectrum that these indicators cover that they aren't just about one thing like tobacco use or income or access to care that it's it does cover the full spectrum and that's what's necessary in order to really achieve the goals okay so so you're using this as the identifier for what action you should take to work to the to the left whether it's alcohol or drug use or diet and exercise so you'd go for diet and exercise and you'd look at number six and that would be physical activity adults and youth and then just trying to figure out if this is a mechanism by which you're trying to drive action or this just an explanation of the way you look at the at the 25 health priorities uh mr chairman i think it's actually more of a way just to look at the 25 health indicators across the spectrum rather than a way that we would actually approach or organize aligning the efforts okay thank you uh anyone else have any questions on the first portion representative tarr thank you mr chairman dr butler we you um were at the presentation for the healthcare commission and in that presentation there were a series of policy recommendations and you know sort of the the what had been generated from the work done by that group and so i'm just wondering from this work and then the work done by that group is there some integration um of those efforts so we're you know sort of um yeah just kind of bringing bringing those efforts together i guess that's what i'm wondering yes um representative tarr through the chair thank you for that uh question um yes in fact we even had had it in the slide although uh in respect for the time frame i i skipped over it fairly quickly but there was uh representation from the health care commission in the process and uh while i didn't mention it during the the lunch and learn uh if you go through the annual reports from the healthcare commission there's a number of times that there are references to healthy alaskans 2020 particularly as it relates to some of the the goals of the healthcare commission for prevention okay thank you okay thank you go ahead your presentation and i think that we don't have other questions at this point okay thank you so mr chairman i'd like to uh introduce rebecca morrissey who is in our section of women's children's and family health in the division of public health who can give us an overview of home visiting in alaska becky are you there and if she's not i'm not nearly as good as okay very good i'm here now okay uh please proceed and uh let us know when you need the slides to forward thank you and uh rebecca would you please identify yourself for the record and go ahead through the chair again my name is rebecca morrissey i'm the unit manager for our perineum early childhood health unit and i coordinate the maternal hemp and early childhood home visiting program for our state so today i'm going to talk a little bit about home visiting in alaska and so this will be the first slide police with an emphasis on evidence-based tone visiting programs so why is home visiting important for families and why is it an important part of public health well there's established evidence that home visits by a nurse social worker or other early child and educator can improve child and family outcomes we know that the early childhood time period is also a critical time for brain development and a child's home is a critical part of the learning environment we also know that parents do need support and they often say that kids don't come with instruction manuals we use the term home visiting law but that really just describes the where what we're really talking about is a voluntary program to provide family support in parent education next slide section was a recipient of federal funding to implement an evidence-based model in an at-risk community in our state and the emphasis on programs to be evidence-based has been an important change to the field and the profession of this work after a statewide needs assessment was completed nurse family partnership was selected as the evidence-based evidence-based model for the alaska program next slide steve so these what i have listed here are the overarching goals of the mcv program and they are to improve health outcomes improve socioeconomic status school readiness decrease intimate partner violence in child maltreatment and also improve parenting skills states are required to report on a benchmark plan that has performance measures related to the six goals i have listed here for example we're looking at such measures as tobacco use prenatal care employment breastfeeding educational attainment among many others next slide please as i mentioned before nurse family partnership was a model selected for our program and it was selected as it best targeted the outcomes that public health wanted to improve in alaska it's an evidence-based model and that is ground in over 37 years of randomized controlled trials and these studies involved comparing the maternal child health and child developmental outcomes with groups of similar mothers who did not participate in the nurse family partnership program next slide please these are some of the outcomes that were identified in those randomized controlled trials and you can see that there were improvements in such things as pre-term delivery child abuse neglect school readiness maternal employment status and also decreases in criminal activity next slide please so being an evidence-based program there's certain criteria and guidelines that are available this program is administered by registered nurses in the home and your family nurse home visitors are utilized in this model as they are perceived as trusting and competent professionals nurses have a set of visit to visit guidelines or a curriculum you could say that guide the content of the visits throughout the program however the model does allow the client to office guide visit content and allows the nurse to use judgment when picking visit priorities or topics for that day women in this program must be enrolled by the 28th week of pregnancy and be a first-time mom this allows for early education on having a healthy pregnancy in the nsp program at providence clients must also be low income and that's defined by medicator with eligibility so visits begin prenatally and end when the child reaches age two next class so the nurse family partnership model includes all the health promotion content and readings that are listed here in addition to many others in regards to nutrition the nurses cover with clients such things as what foods to avoid during pregnancy portion sizes types of healthy foods needed in pregnancy eating healthy on a tight budget and taking multivitamins with folic acid including the recommendation to take 0.4 to 0.8 milligrams of folic acid daily an important part of this program is the relationship that occurs between the nurse and the client the nurse serves as a model for healthy behaviors and beliefs in that client's success nurse home visitors also take a positive approach with clients to build on that clients strengths so along with the important health education promotion screenings provided by the home visitor there's also discussion on life planning and that includes such things as plans for work and also plans for further education there's specific and measurable outcomes that are intended to change the life course trajectory for the woman and her family next slide please so what makes this program evidence-based well critical piece of implementing an evidence-based program is to maintain fidelity to the model meaning that you're implementing the model in the way it was designed for replication we know that model fidelity is important to achieving the desired program outcomes following these elements allows you to best achieve the desired outcomes that were demonstrated in the original trials and our alaska program monterey fidelity ml is an important part of our continuous quality improvement activities running data reports on these elements on a monthly basis allows both public health and the nurse home visitors to understand where things are going well and where there may be opportunities for improvement and lastly the content of the visits is consistent and based on prevention science next slide please so because of the randomized control trials and the extensive research on the replication of this program nurse family partnership has been able to demonstrate a return on investment the rand corporation knows that for every dollar community invests in nfp they can see up to 5.70 in return the trials noted increases in family education and employment status along with savings related to governmental costs such as medicaid and food stamps next slide please so as i mentioned previously alaska has a benchmark plan for evaluating if the program is meeting its purposes and goals we have some preliminary outcomes on the mothers and children that have been seen in the first 21 months of the program and in this small time frame there's been demonstrated improvement in breastfeeding prenatal care which is a healthy alaskans 2020 priority tobacco use and some others you see here so by september 30th of last year there were 100 women enrolled in the program and that is the capacity of the program of the seven mothers in the program whose child had reached one year of age by that time five of the seven had improved their employment status and all seven had improved their educational attainment level since enrollment our numbers and results still are are small and in a rather short time frame whereas nurse family partnership has been following their families over the course of many years next slide please i also wanted to highlight another program within our division and that's healthy start healthy start is a case management program and it's operated out of the norton sound health corporation serving gnome and surrounding 15 villages it's not a home visiting program per se but rather a case management program that includes home visits as a component it also serves families from pregnancy until the child is age two the main goal of healthy start is to decrease infant mortality and there's also a strong community focused on this program along with a strong emphasis on linking clients with behavioral health services next likely and lastly public health nursing it should be mentioned that while public health nursing doesn't have a formal home visiting program for stay or use an evidence-based model they do provide home visiting services in our state using evidence-based practice guidelines these visits are done on a case-by-case episode of basis depending on the community and the number of resources that are available and the target is really those families that are high risk which i have listed here so public health nurses monitor body mass index by measuring height and weight and provide counseling on having a healthy lifestyle and they also try to provide important screenings related to immunizations alcohol and domestic violence next slices so the the goal really is not to provide cases long-term case management services in public health nursing but rather for the nurse to link these at-risk families with needed referrals and facilitate that initiation of case management and these services are not intended to duplicate any other home visiting services or models that may be provided in that community but really act as a safety net for those at-risk families thank uh you you and i guess um the providence in home so there's one program in the state and that's that served about a hundred um pregnant women is that correct through the chart yes that is correct um there are 100 families um at the end of february there were 105 families enrolled in the program each nurse has a caseload of 25 families with a supervisor who carries a small case-loaded client okay i guess are is there a plan to with approximately 11 000 births and probably half of those are singleton um first term bursts uh is there a i mean a hundred is a very small number compared to that um and also only being located in in anchorage is this a pilot project to determine whether there's useful success in at the cost or exactly trying to figure out what i know that public health nurses aren't available for out of home visits almost exclusively at least on the kenai peninsula so this is non-public health nurses in a private setting and how is that funded again sure so the funding comes from the federal government through the health resources services administration and our state received the minimum amount of formula funding so that is why we have one program in one community we did apply for competitive expansion funding that was a bit made available to expand the current program and that is going to allow the addition of four more nurse home visitors both in anchorage and also in the math subaru now but you're correct that 100 families um that is there's more of a need for it outside of 100 families there's certainly more at-risk low-income first-time moms in our state thank you and can you go back to slide 8 for a minute that was on the outcomes identified and so 79 reduction in pre-term deliveries and others who smoked do we have a enough of a sample to find out what the pre-term uh delivery rate is i know that in the last year it went up from 9.6 or so up to 10.3 so seems like overall in the state we're going in the wrong direction so did you have a is there any comparison here or is this just looking at a very few moms who did smoke and i'm trying to figure out how significant this measurement is for us to be able to say very much about the population in the state so the outcomes that are listed on this slide are the outcomes that were identified in nurse family partnership three randomized controlled trials so this is not alaska data that's what they found in the original trial now pre-term delivery is not one of the benchmark plans one of the indicators that we are reporting on but it is something that we monitor in the program i don't have a specific percentage um there have been a couple preterm bursts but again we're dealing with small numbers i don't know the percentage right now but i could follow up with that and get that to you okay thank you and maybe you can send us a link to that those outcomes from the um the randomized control trials so we can look and see where those are and where alaska compares so that we know what we're going with i mean last year we were proposing a 500 birth trial you know protect our children now it was using vitamin d and all and they had taken the preterm birth down to seven percent with just that initiative that was going on and now that's being funded by in south carolina by the um what is it select health the insurance company is is providing the because they were saving so much more by eliminating um taking that from ten and a half down to seven percent pre-term burst would save us a lot of money and a lot of consequences so anyway i appreciate that if you had forward that on back to us uh does anyone else have any other questions on this presentation and i guess the only other thing that i would have is you know we're talking about folic acid um usage and i'm wondering what our neural tube defect rate is now i know that a few years ago we established i think we got it through legislation that um pre prenatal vitamins would have to have a certain amount of folic acid in them and we were trying to get that utilized in all the communities but maybe you can just follow up with us later dr butler um on that because since it's one of the measures that we're talking about right and mr chairman uh i believe that uh the following presentation will specifically address that great thank you um don't see any other questions so thank you very much uh rebecca for your presentation today and um we'll go ahead and proceed okay right um the next presentation is by uh stephanie reitzman birch uh stephanie are you there good afternoon mr chair can you hear me okay it sounds like it we sure can and would you go ahead and identify yourself for the record who you uh represent and also would you um go ahead and say where you are based out of just so we as a committee know where the uh people are based out of thanks yes thank you mr chair so i'm stephanie wrightsville burch i'm the section chief for women children and family health in the division of public health and thank you so much for the invitation i'm here to share with you um and discuss the scientific evidence that supports the national recommendations for folic acid supplementation and what the steps were that led to this national recommendation for all women ages 15 to 44. so first just to make sure we sort of understand what folic acid is it it's actually a vitamin b that's commonly found in foods it's also known as folate which is actually its synthetic form folic acid as a synthetic form is used in vitamin supplements and is added to fortified foods such as breads pasta and cereal in its natural form folic acid is found in small amounts in spinach broccoli asparagus and citrus fruits it's an important dietary component that research has demonstrated will prevent neural tube defects and neural tube defects are the incomplete development of the brain the spinal cord or its coverings that occur occur early in pregnancy we've the research has shown it's very difficult to get an adequate amount of folic if the case is screened out they can um they can let the tribe know if it is if a family that is a member of that tribe so they can they can ideally intervene and provide um support and intervention early on so we can avoid young people coming into our system we all believe that as young people in the system the state is our parent and so um again i appreciate you allowing time today for me to come and speak and for our youth to to show you that well thank you any questions no questions okay thank you very much and thank you for the youth that have appeared today before us it was very impressive thank you very much yes we're next going to be taking uh hb 40 e-cigarettes welcome representative herron please come forward and address us yes thank madam chair and committee members bob herron representative from health district 38. welcome welcome so um madam chair i'd just like to make a real short statement my staff rob is here and more importantly there's others here that wish to testify the reason i introduced this legislation is i appreciate the fact that there are products that people can buy like e-cigarettes and it's their right and i have no problem with it with the device at all the issue though is there might not be any smoke there might not be any ash but the issue with me is how does a person dispose of the extra exhaled aerosol safely and it doesn't harm others so that's why i would like to see the use of these devices be taken to a place where people are allowed to smoke and that's why the moving into the definition and i'm available for questions but others would like to testify yes any questions of representative heron see no questions we'll proceed with additional witnesses that wish to testify i have here a misty jensen is she available miss jensen yes i'm here welcome thank you i'm in wazzilla yes for the record uh please state your name and spell your surname and tell us of any affiliation you have okay my name is misty michelle jensen my last name is j-e-n-s-e-n any affiliation miss jensen no i'm just speaking as a constituent thank you you may proceed thank you i want to testify in favor of hb 40 and the importance of treating electronic cigarettes the same as traditional cigarettes with regard to secondhand smoke the vapor from an e-cigarette is not water vapor but is in fact an aerosol that contains nicotine and toxic chemicals and that is from the cdc it's not safe to smoke or inhale as a mother of two daughters aged 11 and 14 i'm horrified by the messages that they see in ads and in stores promoting e-cigarettes as safe this simply is not true we are in danger of the renormalization of smoking with the emergence of these new products and as leaders and decision makers and healthcare we must send a clear message that smoking includes the use of electronic cigarettes thank you thank you for your testimony are there any questions of this witness thank you we'll go on to our next witness we do have someone in the audience um miss emily ninon can you come up and uh for the record tell us your names spell your surname and your affiliation of any thank you welcome thank you it's pleasure to be before you for the record my name is emily neenan my last name is spelled n-e-n-o-n i am the alaska government relations director for the american cancer society cancer action network and pleased to be here before you again today on this topic of electronic cigarettes i have submitted a letter that you should have in your packets also did respond to the committee aide with some information that representative stutz had asked some questions for some more information when i was here on tuesday so those citations are there and i'm just want to mention there are hundreds of different uh products on the market being marketed as electronic cigarettes and they are unregulated which means we don't know what's in any given one of them i'm not here to talk about their use as a cessation device this bill doesn't address that we're strictly looking at exposure to the secondhand aerosol as the previous testifier mentioned the difference between a vapor as a state of matter versus an aerosol and aerosol contains fine particles unlike a vapor of either liquid solid or both there are a number of growing number of studies that have looked at the contents of e-cigarette aerosol propylene glycol nicotine and flavorings were most commonly found in that e-cigarette aerosol and other studies have found the aerosol to contain heavy metals volatile organic compounds tobacco-specific nitrosamines and other potentially harmful chemicals which is why we're concerned about second-hand exposure and with that i'd be happy to answer any further questions the the committee may have and continue to carry on this conversation through the process yes uh representative stood thank you i'm looking at my information here and i have lots of information from people that say they don't support house bill 40 but i don't see any any of the studies or any of that information that you're speaking of now maybe since we're going to leave this open you could drop it by my office but but i i'm interested in actually seeing the studies seeing how current they are and seeing how firm they are because everything that i've been able to uh find myself and read it's maybe possibly could be and it appears that there's just not enough information to classify these as a tobacco type cigarette i i read several articles the recent most recent is uh march 12 2015 new study finds no health concerns in e-cigarette vapors so you know this is clearly a pretty controversial issue and i certainly wouldn't expect you to take any other position than you've taken being that you work for the american cancer society but i i still and again i say maybe there's evidence that i haven't seen but i'm just not convinced that this is that there's enough evidence to say and without seeing the actual studies and who they're by and how current they are and that they're actually solid i i'm having a hard time with this thank you representative any other questions of this witness if i may i do have the the documents that um i uh emailed to the committee aide earlier i have those in my hand here be happy to give those to you and carry on this uh be happy to continue the conversation and and and compare notes with what we're all learning here about these new products thank you and uh was that distributed to everyone here i'll give it to you and we can make sure copies are made for everyone thank you thank you so much for your time appreciate it and the next witness is also present in the room dr butler would you uh step up and thank you madam chairman uh for the record my name is jay butler uh what am i i'm the chief medical officer in the department of health and social services it may well be that aerosols from e-cigarettes pose less of a threat from second-hand exposure than traditional cigarettes but i would caution against assuming that they are safe given that studies have shown that metabolites of nicotine are recoverable from people who are exposed to aerosols from e-cigarettes second hand the division struck has struggled also with this question of where do e-cigarettes fall on the spectrum of risk and recently completed a literature review so i'll be happy to get a copy of that to the to the entire committee so that you would have that for reference as well thank you dr butler um you know there is potential for uh e-cigarettes as a harm reduction technique perhaps even for a smoking cessation tool uh but i think it's important to keep in mind that some of the data suggests that actually e-cigarettes are being used as a way to deliver supplemental nicotine to people who currently smoke rather than as replacement for smoking and in fact when you look at some of the way the product is marketed uh the majority are talking about ways that you can smoke when smoking's not allowed i also wanted to raise the concern about uh the fact that we've made a lot of progress in smoking reduction among our young people yet the way e-cigarettes are being marketed with flavors like cherry crush peachy keens skittles bubble gum captain crunch chocolate treat vanilla dreams these are seem to be going for a much younger demographic than the marlboro man is going to appeal to so i think as we struggle with this question of uh what are the threats there's two that i wanted to highlight one has already been highlighted by one of our one of the constituents who called in is that is that e-cigarettes pose the threat of renormalizing smoking behavior and i think that's particularly a challenge for our younger people also given what we do know is in the aerosols as well as what we don't know because it's not a regulated product it's considered proprietary information i think it does pose a threat to indoor air quality therefore the goals of hb 40 to allow e-cigarette use only in places where cigarette smoking is not prohibited makes good public health sense and i thank you for the opportunity to speak to you thank you are there any questions of dr butler no questions thank you and we look forward to the written materials you refer to thank you the next witness is on the line and ashley perter hello i'm here yes thank you for the record please identify yourself and your affiliation of any okay my name is ashley pelt here my last name is spelled p-e-l-t-i-e-r and i'm here today representing myself i live in bolton was the law i'm here today in support of hb40 to ask you to treat electronic cigarettes the same as traditional cigarettes in regard to second-hand smoke exposure the vapor emitted by these devices has been shown to contain ultrafine particles that when inhaled exhaust exacerbate respiratory issues such as asthma the vapor is also known to contain chemicals such as benzene cadmium and formaldehyde additionally as dr butler mentioned mentioned flavored vape juices such as cotton candy and gummy bear are particularly enticing to use which is concerning to me i'd also like to state that there was a time when the tobacco industry told us that second-hand smoke was harmless and not only that it was harmless but that smoking was good for us we now know different and i am reluctant to trust the tobacco industry when they say that e-cigarettes and second-hand aerosol are safe nobody should be unwillingly exposed to a substance that can harm them and i ask you to support hb40 because everyone deserves the right to breathe clean air thank you thank you are there any questions of this witness cnn will thank you very much we'll proceed to our next witness a mr clay bessanick yeah do you hear me yes clearly yeah hello there my name's clay beznick my name is uh glassbell last name is b-e-z-e-n-e-k and the affiliation you know just myself as a as a citizen of the state welcome you may proceed thank you thank you very much i learned a lot of stuff today about uh a lot of things other than other than this so it was a good good time sitting on the phone hanging out um the uh yeah i'm i'm definitely against house bill 48 i really understand the reasoning behind it for sure i think that possibly some federal legislation should be in the works to regulate the industry however i i commercial fish for salmon here in southeast and the rest of the year i worked on tugboats and i i know firsthand numerous people that have quit smoking because of e-cigarettes and being a non-smoker myself i i've i've actually got on different tug boats because the whole crew smoked except me and it was so annoying to have to smell smoke in a tight confined space such as a tugboat even though it's 100 feet long it was just you know stupid i grew up in a smoking family so i'm pretty pretty anti-smoking actually and i've seen the e-cigarette industry come out i think it's a real positive step for the tobacco industry to to do what they're doing um but i think the regulation is a little is a little premature on uh on vilifying people as it were to make them step outside or going uh in a another part of a facility when i i haven't seen the information and believe me if i'm gonna smoke or if i'm gonna smell second-hand smoke even from an e-cigarette i've i've done a lot of research myself and until i find out that that it's it's not a it's or it's a bad thing for me then i'll definitely be against it but i just think that uh house bill 40 is just a little bit possibly before it's time so i think you're i thank you for the ability to testify thank you for patiently waiting i see you've waited almost two hours to testify so thank you any questions of this witness well thank you this will be unfortunately our last witness we have to go to the floor to consider the budget i realized there are there's 14 or 15 other individuals that would like to testify um we will keep public testimony open we will hold hb 40 over for more discussions at a later date and for more witnesses to speak on the issue and we'll have to adjourn i'm sorry anyway you
Um86WQ3M1FM,1-5-2016,3320,WI,the testimony we have no written registers for her against so we will move on to the next bill which is a V 502 and we have represented a Kirkman and representative Taylor here speak in support of the bill my testimony you guys will be coming so [Applause] you have it is it's already Minister office person chairman Keaton members thank you so much for hearing to somebody bail 502 the liquid nicotine bill representative Taylor and I have come together to put forth the common-sense bipartisan piece of legislation aimed at protecting the public by regulating liquid nicotine packaging in recent years electronic cigarettes have become very popular alternative to traditional cigarettes the FDA defines electronic cigarettes as products designed to deliver nicotine or other substance to a user in a form of a vapor these devices continue heating elements in a cartridge for the substance often nicotine cigarettes are in a closed or open system closed systems are similar to this kind of a system it's a closed system which is sealed by the manufacturer not intended to be opened by the consumer open systems are similar on this but are refillable and used that substance usually or substance similar to that you pour it into that container these products are ready and available on the open market however they are not regulated it is important to note that a teaspoon of diluted nicotine can poison a child this is a this is actually how much fluid kill a child liquid nicotine one local supplier boasts on its website that one in 15 millimeter bottle of liquid nicotine is equivalent to one carton of traditional cigarette cigarettes or look to a different way one bottle can potentially kill 3 children therefore it's important to regulate these items so that the potential dud is minimized ad 502 provides needed regulation for liquid nicotine in an open system that requires the Department a trade and consumer protection to promulgate rules requiring special child-resistant packaging for open systems of liquid nicotine child restraint packaging is defined which packaging that cannot be opened under a child of age 5 a be bypassing ad 502 Wisconsin would join 18 other states who have enacted this legislation so thank you today for taking the time to hear somebody bill 502 and I am optimistic that myself and representative Taylor and join us in supporting this piece of legislation so again thank you so much and well thank you so much Sharon Heenan thank you community members and thank you represent Kirkman we have learned a lot working on this bill this bill really is about protecting kids I mean that's really the bottom line this liquid nicotine is toxic it's a toxic substance it can kill a child and it has it killed an 18 month old child and there's been many many instances of poisoning from liquid nicotine even getting this on your skin is going to burn you it's very good I'm not going to open this because I don't want it to get anywhere but these containers are very very easy to open any three-year-old trial is going to figure out how to open this and these containers are in kid attractive packaging this one has a monkey on it with bananas they come in gummy bear flavoring they come in pink bubblegum lemonade with very bright packaging it's very attracted to a child very attractive to a child and so that's really our concern we're not talking about these kinds of packaging as Weber sent Kirkman said they're closed you can't get in them it's more this open type of packaging that is really really deadly to a child and we're seeing that other states have passed these laws this is really simple just requires basically child safety packaging Arkansas has passed a law like this Wyoming really across the board red states blue states have passed these laws because really at the end of the day we all want to protect kids and we don't want any child to die from getting just a tiny bit of the toxic substance in their system so I'm happy to answer any questions we do have a really um pretty broad support from the bill both Democrats and Republicans so we're very optimistic about it and we really think it's a it will be a very good piece of policy to have in our state and I just want to add one other thing I mean Chris came forward with the idea and I was talking about it my girlfriend who's actually bought the system the closed system for her parents to try to get them to move off of the traditional cigarettes and in that research found it told me that you know nicotine deceivin getting a small amount can be just very very harmful to your system so that the teaspoon could kill and poison a child to death but a small amount you know is just as hazardous and so that's really why I want to you know to work with Chris when when when this bill will be outdated dia came forward thank you very much any questions thank you very much mr. chair um so just the bill address where does will be displayed in stores obviously get small like cigarettes right it's just the packaging that would be another interesting bill however because a lot of the tobacco that might be something you all want to consider a lot of these tobacco products that aren't cigarettes but they're chewing there they look like bubble gum they're all in front of the counter and they're really designed to appeal to kids which is very disturbing so we don't address that this really addresses the packaging we thought that was the most critical piece but there certainly are other issues with all of these tobacco products that are targeted really at kids could the Department and on the typically and our something that's been yeah it's a good idea you guys should do thank you the first part of this bill is pretty clear to me if you just elaborate on the part of it that also requires these rules to meet the specifications and follow the testing methods for special packaging provided under federal regulations sure okay so we didn't want to create two potentially two sets of rules because at some point the feds are gonna rank it like this I think it's a matter of time they do there's a lot of toxic substances that are regulated at the federal level and usually it's a specific testing protocol so what this follows is basically the federal testing protocols which says that you have to demonstrate in order to be a childproof thing it's child resistant effectiveness of not less than 85 percent so they test on kids basically and see what percentage of kids can open these things and so we're just adopting that standard we have worked with some of the tobacco producers companies who much preferred that there be one standard and does not create separate state standard and then there be a separate federal standard so that's it's really trying to make it easy while really addressing the guts of the problem which is this actually this container the manufacturer says this is childproof any three-year-old can open s you basically just turn it and it opens but they're saying this is safety a safety container because it's not there's no standards that are used so we're just taking the standards that are currently being used thank you at that point order those ours these statues change if the federal testing changes that they adopt the 95% if they adopt a different type of test will are a lot follow with that state statute or a rule locked into that it should follow and that's what the bill basically says is that dad can't pass you all are giving the legislature is giving authority of dad cap to promulgate rules that reflect that federal standard and we thought that made sense it made it a little easier we thought for the manufacturers they always want one standard and the Fed standard is good I mean this is you know a good testing protocol we thought just to make sure kids don't get it so it would follow and I don't know if ledge council wants to address that too but I think it's manufacturers moving to a locked-in mechanism or do you just fix this with just something to be more childproof twist-off well a lot of drugs do have the childproof twist off it's a lot harder than this I mean I would pass this around for anyone I want anyone to get this on their skin I don't want to open it but you will see this is basically a twist off you know any kind of even aspirin I mean it's much harder to get open than this ball you know any really any toddlers gonna figure this out it's very easy to open and we were actually shocked you know because today there's safety but you twist this off and it's open Thanks yeah thank you all for putting this bill I think it's great what is the penalty boys store that station if they ignore I think it's a big problem especially the wealthy work we have a lot of porn stores and gas stations in Japanese places they're selling stuff what's a ballet experinces yeah and dad can't I mean I believe there is a penalty mechanism for manufacturers that do not comply with state rules I mean all a pledge counsel if you could address that but I do believe that cap would have the authority to not just a manufacturer with a particular store penalized for selling something yeah and we didn't change the purview of dad cap whatever purview they have for other toxic substances that should be tripping to trial through yeah absolutely no that's a great question when you're making sure that this is giving dad kept that opportunity to go out and actually monitor this you know I know there are some stores that buy in bulk and then they make it in the back room put the bottles to order that's what is happening right here this is a label this is actually created yeah this has been labeled from I've learned I've learned a lot about this this the spate creeping is there anywhere in this where such a time for when this new law would take place and is there any a grandfathering in of things that are already on the shelf or would it be prohibited the sale of these types of paper devices religious the in terms of the manufacturer so the bill specifies that the department is required to probably get rules related to the special packaging of liquid nicotine right the rule making process then so that's what the requirement is from the bill and the process that may be expedited rulemaking only applies to what's provided the bill which is they may probably get a rule faster than normal but that rule is only for special packaging for liquid latex penis mask or any other sort of type of issue thank you and I guess I just want to add it I mean currently under it's got to level this is there's no requirement that there be a child who's 14 and I guess that's represent a line Iowa we're specifically looking at the packaging to make sure that if a family but you know somebody purchase it brings it all to their house they're filling up one of the every cigarette that they leave this on the counter that a five-year-old coming by is I'm going to just be able to get the top off easily because they see a monkey on the packaging oh gosh that smells like banana it's not like you know you know what's really in that you're not Michelle kuso representing Wisconsin grocers Association Michelle met her Children's Hospital of Wisconsin registering in favor mark read young Allegheny County Board of Supervisors register in favor and Mary I'm sorry mark rather the time was kinds of Medical Society registering in favor and that concludes our testimony 989 502 and we're gonna go to a B 520 relating to authority of the Department of Agriculture trade consumer protection regarding motor vehicle fueling facilities and we have representative John Ballet here to testify in support I'm sure this one will give me just as simple and quick as that definite last one sorry it's a new year well thank you city didn't as chairman he and members of the committee on consumer protection for holding this public hearing since at least 2002 Wisconsin has required retail locations with unattended fuelling with no employee on site to maintain a telephone or other approved means available to the public to notify the fire department in case of emergency the requirement to have emergency phones at gas stations came from the recommended rule of the National Fire Protection Association very respected but a non-governmental advocacy group that was adopted by then the Wisconsin Department of Commerce without consulting the industry after adoption it wasn't enforced for convenience stores that were open with an inside phone available presumably because Department staff felt it was unnecessary and burdensome well when the Department of Agriculture trade protection conserve protection took over jurisdiction for the regulation of underground storage tanks their interpretation of this rule expanded the requirement to all retail facilities those that were even closed for a period of hours to have an outside phone enforcement this rule is drastically changed in recent months the enforcement itself reflects the time when phones were not readily available in 2013 the Pew Research Center found that 91% of all adults do have carry cell phones with them additionally all gas stations have emergency shutoff switches or buttons clearly visible to customers I would I would submit that if you go to the gas station you'll know where the shut-off is but you don't know where the emergency phone is once these button are pushed a fire cannot spread the tanks avoiding serious disaster therefore it makes sense that once the shutoff button is pushed drivers should exit the scene then at a place of safety use their cell phone to contact emergency services we know of no other businesses that are required to have an emergency phone available to the public 24/7 the Wisconsin petroleum markers and convenience store Association and dad cat have met several times to work on this issue but the department's interpretation of the rule requires enforcement as the co-chair of JCR er I greatly appreciate in the respect that the department recognizes the parameters of their ability to to work on this so we feel the best way to change this burdensome requirement we need to rewrite the law dad cap has agreed to wait to enforce their interpretation so we could address this through legislation we have representatives from the petroleum marketers and businesses here to testify as well they will address the everyday and practical issues regarding this rule so I thank you very much for your time happy to answer any questions thank you very much we do have some additional witnesses Denise Thomas man max Walker representing the WP MCA in favor and thank you for letting me speak today about this important bill I would like to introduce myself I am Denise Thomas and I am co-owner of Pine River mini-marts with my husband Steve we've been in business since 1997 we have two locations in the man talk area and we employ 17 employees the reason I'm here today because I'm asking you to rewrite the law regarding the emergency phones that we need to have located outside of our stores for the public in case of an emergency we are having problems with these phones due to two major reasons weather that
CUDslaI4QPQ,09-13-2013,2473,RI,we have is bill number 622 that's a bill by majority leader rogério and we have a number of people here signed up to testify we'll start with John Hogan jr. Steve Boyana Vianney Laura Akers Patricia Nolan mr. Hogan good afternoon welcome Thank You mr. chairman uh it's a privilege to be before this committee again and pleasure to be back home in Rhode Island my name is Jack Hogan I work in public affairs with Reynolds American which is a second largest largest tobacco company locally in the United States and located in winston-salem North Carolina and we're here to voice our support for Senate bill 622 we think this is an important bill because it addresses the current law in Rhode Island regarding access to tobacco products by youth in it and actually what this bill does is it extends the current law to products while not tobacco products and are not yet covered in this area and we're speaking specifically of two types of products electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes which have been in the marketplace for approximately six years and are available for sale here at retail in Rhode Island and in an emerging product that is really in very limited distribution around the United States and and that's a tobacco derived nicotine products as a defined in the bill but these are lozenges or that contain nicotine derived from tobacco but do not contain tobacco it's important to note that under Rhode Island law there is no prohibition against - purchasing electronic cigarettes and we think that the law should be changed and we think that this bill sets about to do that now I'd like to point out that we believe that this law as it's currently written has been effective in combating youth access to tobacco products if you were to look at the statistics maintained by the federal government you'll see in the last 15 years the the youth smoking rate here in Rhode Island has dropped by more than half and we also think that if you look at statistics provided by the state of Rhode Island the federal government a significant part of this has been due to the good work of the retailers the licensed retailers who sell tobacco products in Rhode Island the recent numbers submitted by the state of Rhode Island the federal government indicates that there's a violation rate of about eleven percent which means that almost 90 percent of retailers are in compliance according to the checks but what I'd like to do here is address the three or four key points of this bill because the laws that restrict access to tobacco products in the laws that we think should limit access to cigarette products cover a couple of different areas of the statute and so if you'll just permit me to walk through what I think of the key pieces of this bill and explain why we think this is important quite simply section one is the core of the bill it includes these electronic cigarettes which I'll eat defined as a vapor product and tobacco derived nicotine products in the current prohibition against the purchase possession or use of tobacco products by minors now it's important because these products are not currently covered that this section also defines a vapor product an electronic cigarette and I'll show you what one looks like and it also defines a tobacco derived nicotine product those lozenges that contain nicotine that I spoke of earlier in addition to prohibiting purchase possession and use and defining the product section one also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes by retailers it requires a mandatory sign at retail it prohibits distribution of samples of electronic cigarettes to minors and would prohibit the distribution or sale through the mail to minors now I think this particular section of the bill might elicit a little bit of discussion today and what what was intended here was to incorporate the electronic cigarette product in the tobacco drive cigarette product in the existing law you see of a section in the law that requires age verification upon delivery and I think that there may be so folks will quarrel with the way that's that the bill addresses this point we'd be happy to discuss that if there's a maybe another way to go at it and that's the nobility that's the core of the bill of what it does in Section 1 prohibits youth purchase use of possession defines the product prohibits sale requires signage and prohibits samples I'd like to draw your attention to the definitions because there are two specific definitions but let's you have a question I do and I apologize for interrupting during your presentation I don't know if I'm jumping the gun or what and you've defined a couple of the products one of the things that I see in here that I don't I don't know if I don't understand or is not explained well enough but a vapor product what are the vapor products include the the vapor product include would essentially includes the what is known or referred to as an electronic cigarette the reason we suggest that the term vapor product is the better approach than electronic cigarette is the legal definition of a cigarette is a role of tobacco in paper an electronic cigarette for those of you are not familiar essentially has three parts but it notably it does not contain tobacco it contains a vial of liquid which contains nicotine and other ingredients it contains a battery and it contains a heating element and what it does is eat the liquid and create a vapor which then the user referred to I think as vapors to inhale or take in the vapor from the product so while the popular nomenclature in the common nomenclature is e cigarette we think that the more precise term vapor product is probably more accurate because unlike a cigarette this does not burn tobacco and it does pretty create smoke it creates a nicotine vapor and with respect to that definition there's also a clause in the definition that does not in that seeks to exclude from the definition of vapor products any products that have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration as nicotine replacement therapies or as drugs for therapeutic purposes so the purpose of this bill is not to include those products that are preserved used for a medical purpose such as nicorette gum or transdermal patches or nicotine inhalers we are talking about electronic cigarettes which we define which we suggest should be defined as vapor products and seek to extend the prohibition of against access by - to these products centered on body Jack I don't mean to interrupt as well but but in carrying on senator Lynch's question isn't there also in for lack of a better term and II hookah now as well the making products hookah products as well and that's why that we think originally think the vapor product is the better definition because you can find in the marketplace of an e cigar an e pipe e-cigarettes and learn something every day I did not know there was an e hookah but thank you very much for bringing that up and so we think aboard a broader definition will capture all of these products which as we understand do essentially the same thing heat a liquid to deliver nicotine vapor I like to know where the e cigars are save a lot of money but that's another story senator Nessa Busch yes thank you mr. chairman and a little bit confused is the purpose of the bill to prohibit these e-cigarettes and if so why is there other stuff in the bill about regulating it and controlling it and taxing it if we're going to prohibit it well we're not prohibiting we're prohibiting access by minors this bill is simply to prohibit the purchase use in possession of these products by minors not prohibit the product for purchase by adults here in Rhode Island only restrict and prohibit the use and access by minors is that is that clear yes and quite simply senator the way the law is constructed as it's currently constructed the provisions addressing youth access are found in essentially two main chapters first the chapter entitled children which is the core of the bill in section 1 and also the the term vapor and vapor products in vapor derived products are also included in the licensing section which is section 3 of the bill and are these vapor cigarettes are they bad for the health of adults in a similar way or what are the health ramifications of these evei / products well first and foremost no tobacco product is safe however it is and our company intends to go into national distribution with our product this year currently the literature indicates that the electronic cigarette does not expose the user to the constituents that are found in smoke from smoking a traditional cigarette and quite simply the weight of the health information is that it is the constituents in the smoke from a cigarette that causes the health problems because this does not is not tobacco smoke and does not have those constituents on that there is the sciences emerging in this area but it it's it's a I believe that to accurately summarize this the opinions in this area that the e-cigarette presents a significantly different health risk than a traditional cigarette Senator Connelly is the FDA currently reviewing these products to determine whether or not they should be regulated by the FDA FDA as well they are senator and and that's an important point in 2000 and this was this how would the FDA was going to regulate this was actually subject of a decision by the US Court of Appeals a DC Circuit in December 2010 initially it appeared that the FDA wanted to regulate the electronic cigarette as a medical device under under the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act there was litigation and the end result at least as it currently stands in the decision the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was that the the FDA should regulate these products not as a device but rather like a tobacco product under the family family control arm the what was known as the FDA bill that regulates tobacco however since December 2010 there there has been quite simply pokeberry anticipating regulations to be issued by the FDA but they have not been issued yet but it is expected in accordance with that decision that the FDA will in fact be regulating these products in the same way they regulate tobacco products under the FDA bill well does this legend continue senator thank you doesn't the legislation though exclude any product regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration under Chapter five of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act it does because that's that's the section of the law that covers medical devices or drugs the e-cigarette is already by federal law been determined to not fall into that category but rather falls under the FDA's on smoking Protection Act so then we would not be at risk than if the product does become regulated by the FDA that would essentially the state would essentially lose its ability to implement stricter controls if we determine that was necessary going forward because of that exclusion in the statute right I don't see how that's possible in the reason being is I think that if Rhode Island were to adopt this bill they would actually be ahead of what's going what is likely to occur at the federal level and that is Rhode Island would be treating this electronic cigarette for youth of access purposes as if it was a tobacco product which is exactly what is expected to happen at the federal level it that they're going to be regulated under the FDA's tobacco authorization not under the drug and device offer uh but we do but quite simply this in this provision in this definition that exclusion was intended you know I can tell you what what why that that provision is there it was intended to make clear that nicotine products that have already been approved by the FDA for therapeutic purposes such as nicotine gum and transdermal patches are not inadvertently swept up into the prohibition against of of this particular bill I'm still concerned that it had exactly the opposite effect that language is pretty specific to exclude any product product regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration under Chapter five of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act we should the FDA should the FDA regulations once they're issued do exactly that then the state of Rhode Island essentially lose its ability but but whether the circuit court has or the Circuit Court of Appeals has already said that these products should be regulated under the provisions of what they call the tobacco act which is short in for the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 they've already said at least in that decision that they will not be regulated under the provisions of the federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act so we believe that that cause it's consistent what is with what is the controlling federal court decision in this area and what is what the course of the regulatory of events that should follow what's the FDA issues regulations how we certainly be willing to discuss whether that causes is absolutely necessary I mean if there is a way to say that more precisely um to address that concern and certainly be willing to try to construct language to make that clear Thank You senator Hodgson Thank You chairman on a quick question you mentioned the DC Circuit all right under any other federal circuit courts that are considering this question know it to the best of my knowledge on the precise question of where electronic cigarettes should be regulated for the purposes of federal law it's my understanding that the decision of the DC Circuit Court of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is in fact the operating decision in this particular area as it pertains to regulation of the product at the federal level and so your company is not involved in litigation whether it be in the US district courts or the federal circuit courts elsewhere on the same question because generally in that that is how the legal question is going to be settled when different circuits come up with a different interpretation I can't report that while my company is probably involved in litigation somewhere about something that we we who we have to the best of my knowledge because we haven't entered the marketplace with our product in a national distribution yet I'm not aware of us challenging I will tell you that however what the company what Reynolds is doing is supporting legislation in more than 20 states to include the electronic cigarette in the law prohibiting youth access and in fact in addition to supporting it in more than 20 states we have seen it enacted in three states this year and in in the states that are considering it we're seeing it passed with near unanimous voters in both states regardless of the political complexion it's chairman if I could just follow up certainly senator Hodgson now that we've talked to I think twice now you've said the primary and only purpose of this is to prevent the sale of these devices to minors that's correct on why bring this this hire new unsettled business line into a regulatory scheme of Licensing for tobacco products why don't we just bend it for minors give it a definition I think these definitions are adequate and the ban is adequate why don't we just keep it well to keep it limited to the purpose that you've intended because I haven't heard any any discussion about why we should put this into a licensing and regulatory I think in and if I were to refer to some material that I found on the tobacco control website I think that the license to sell to tobacco products at retail is an important component of the youth tobacco prevention program quite simply if a person is and I think this is why the violation rate is is one of the reasons the violation rate may be as low as it is if a license is at risk it seems that it would behoove a retail store owner who's selling these products not to put that license at risk bike bike selling to minors so the penalty would be equally applicable to to a vendor whether they're part of a licensing scheme or not and so there may well be valid policy arguments to put them into this regulatory scheme but you know one thing that you testify to is that the the constituents of inhaling this is nicotine vapor presents a unique if there's a health hazard is it is unique separate and distinct from that of tobacco touch correct so other than tobacco other than the a common chemical ingredient of nicotine which as I understand it I have to ask my brother the doctor but I understand it that's not you know that's not this severe health risk that we are addressed with tobacco I will agree with you on that so if there are no similar motivations to to regulate regulating II delivery devices and and burned tobacco why would you put them in the same license basically the answer to that is that the licensing structure has been affected we believe that the data shows that it's been effective in keeping tobacco products out of the hands of youth and so we think if it's worked there it can work here sure well let me ask you this another way would you support this bill if we made this simply a ban on providing these devices to youths and left the licensing to follow whether its developments in the federal circuit courts or or FDA action or a more uniform national approach to this climate merging technology I believe that we could because if the core objective here is keeping these products out of the hands of minors and that's and and that's what the bill will do without regard to licensing then then certainly we would we would support that legend that legislation okay are there any other questions or comments for this witness senator Connelly thank you raised in that colloquy now exactly what the product is is it clear then that every product out there marketed as an e-cigarette has either tobacco or nicotine derived from tobacco in it or there are other products out there marketed as cigarettes that do not an e-cigarette as it's commonly understood does not contain any tobacco it contains a liquid it can it is has liquid which contains nicotine which is derived from two packages of tobacco derivative that's correct okay but does not contain nicotine number one and number two you know there's always going to be a complicated answer to a simple question number two there are some manufacturers that that manufacture an electronic cigarette with varying levels of nicotine including no nicotine is that they still call it an e-cigarette but I can't explain that that's not our product and I am just aware that that is out there so then my understanding is and that there products out there being Martha as cigarettes which don't contain the nicotine derivative in it so that the products marketers e-cigarettes are some which would be covered by the definition in this legislation and some which would not well I do quite simply if it doesn't contain nicotine oh and it would not fit within the proposed definition of a vapor product because it's the nicotine that we're trying to keep it's the fact that it contains nicotine that you're trying to keep out of the hands of kids so from an enforcement and from a a vendor perspective how do we go about distinguishing in the legislation the difference between you know those that have the nicotine derivative knows that don't and again assuming a goal is that Senator Hodgson said a moment ago to keep it to keep the product out of the hands of those 18 and under how do we address that in the legislation well you know that's pretty interest I just became aware of the zero nicotine product and it became aware of the zero nicotine product and I am aware that it does it would not be captured because it doesn't contain nicotine in the definition as it's currently written but um I guess then the question becomes is is if it doesn't contain nicotine what's what's the reason to keep it i I don't know what what I don't know what the question is um if it's not covered then it's not caught well wouldn't they at least one possible response to your query be that we don't want that product that is like a cigarette similar to a cigarette to get in the hands of those 18 and under as an entryway to the use of cigarettes isn't that at least one possible you know response to your quote basically the if the prevailing information about these products is that they are used by smokers um to stop it in in in lieu of cigarettes but the point being is I think that if there is a product out there that we need to address that has that's called an e-cigarette but does not contain nicotine then it's possible we make the definition a little bit longer to contain that to include that product if in fact that's what needs to be done but if it doesn't need to if it doesn't contain nicotine the question is does it need to be done senator Connelly then settled on body oh thank you just warm up a limo ironic got one will follow cushion is a slightly different part of the bill senator Archibald if I understand the bill correctly the as I read the bill and if I'm if I'm not reading it correctly please please tell me that it imposes the penalty on the minors for attempting to purchase the tobacco dry product as opposed to the vendor my understanding that correctly actually you are and that is how the law is currently written and as a matter fact that language is that language is verbatim from the statute as it's currently written and senator I think it's important to note that that that particular provision was the subject of legislation in this General Assembly last year which changed it slightly in required tobacco cessation education for minors who were convicted and that bill was vetoed by the governor but this bill as it's currently proposed makes no change to the current penalty for minors who are found in possession or using or attempt to purchase tobacco right so what of acknowledging you are history is being accurate this bill it doesn't change the fact that this bill would not impose any penalty on the seller of the product to the minor oh no it does there are penalty provisions for retailers as well if if you give me a moment correct identify that for me I'm being told that Section B so I'll look at that Thank You mr. Chen Sandlin body Thank You mr. chairman Jack I think that the fact that we're having this discussion seems and I tend to agree with Senator hanshan in the sense that I we have a comprehensive tobacco legislation and we understand the purpose for which that tobacco legislation is passed we now technology has brought us to 2013 and there is this item called a vapor product which I see is being defined as a non combustible tobacco derived product containing nicotine I will say if nothing else I learned one thing tonight and my thought was that all these folks that are trying to quit smoking they tell me it's water in that there's no nicotine base in it at all but but I learned now that but I think that the intent if the intent is to protect children that I agree with the senator that this should be legislation in and of itself in a separate section and we can define out this product containing nicotine as being the so-called bad product and you know let the water cigarette forward where it may or if we decide that you know it's the mere act of puffing that we want to want our children not to embrace then we we embrace that and put that under that same umbrella and senator we certainly happy to work with with this committee the sponsor or other stakeholders to to get to that to get to that point if that's what the approach here was if the federal law was going to regulate these products in the same way tobacco products than what you have offered here is a legislation that follows a similar path if there's a better way to get there it's not how we start it's how we finish and how we want to finish is keeping these products out of the hands of minors are there any other questions or comments for this witness thank you sir [Music] make sure the red buttons up please Thank You chairman committee my name is Steve Bayonne I started a company called Sega team in November of 2008 Rhode Island based company I was actually the first one to introduce this e cigarette or electronic cigarettes who said of rhode island in new england market during that time there's been a lot of uphill battles with you know reynolds and a lot of big tobacco early on and just to kind of clear up some of the licensing issues because we could have saved a lot of time and paper on the extended bill we do agree on the restrictions for 18 year olds and minors I've adopted that since 2008 we have we card signs and we're currently in the process of working with weak heart on you know supporting all our vendors card and it's just been something that we've adopted forever it's on our packaging so we totally agree with that aspect of the bill we truly believe that it should really be a blanket federal regulation this is an opinion on why they would agree on licensing and some of those changes to really just curtail what we've established and in four and a half years because they had no interest in this market they just wanted to really crush this back in um 2008 and you know just for him presenting that abuse which I knew about for years was in production this is just a way involved of setting us back and forcing us to you know to be licensed and kind of you know make the plane feel a little even for them because you know they have a stronghold in a convenience market they don't have an online presence there basically forward five years behind times we were the elephant in the room and now you know they they're ready to you know partner up with us in a sense so we do want to work together on on making this a product you know that that we definitely don't want in the hands of minors but the licensing is just a way of curtailing what we've created the awareness the brand awareness that I I've spent and then you know my employees my vendors are here we spent countless you know hours and then in just years of introducing this and then fighting legislative you know and now they're on board and we're happy you know to see them in a space but the licensing is just it's just a ploy just to you know just just the cause we make it a lot harder for some of the smaller local guys to do business and and you know they've been playing in this field for for many years and we know Anna Hodgson thing was chairman on jachnoon completely unfamiliar with the e-cigarette market and could you tell me a little bit about what that looks like in Rhode Island what are the distribution channels either that you use or you're familiar with and and tell us a little bit how this would impact your business other than having to go apply for a license right the impact wouldn't really exciting I'm sorry just one more question what other products are you selling okay we we only sell and distribute electricity rates we have like he mentioned various nicotine levels so we do have a non nicotine there's no way of distinguishing a non from a high in a sense I mean they are marked and they're labeled but realistically to try to police this this product it's going to take a lot more than you know just a conversation today the electronic cigarette is a alternative to smoking products a lot of our customers actually start with an on nicotine because it's just that the habit is what's hard to really check it's not so much the addictive ingredient in a cigarette it's just the everyday habit so this this kind of curtails it and that's why there's a high success rate with our product the second part of your question again the distribution are you selling these so your distributor yes okay and it wasn't clear from my testimony and you're distributing it to retail yep we have retail locations what what type of businesses are selling this what are your customers look like are they convenience stores are they retail shops is it online can you just give a story we have uh we have online sector which is about 10% of our business we have a specialty retail which we started on Providence Place in Warwick mall we have two locations in there retail specialty means cell which only the carts inside the malls okay we also have a convenience stores as a distribution on Foxwoods casino and MGM carries our product here in New England and we have other states with the same distribution channel okay Thank You him are there any other questions or comments for this witness sent on the body just a quick question because we can't decipher between an on nicotine cigarette and a high nicotine or a medium nicotine are you suggesting that the eighteen you're under eighteen shouldn't have access to any of them no right thank you that's what I thought thank you you can continue and then on top of it in just since 2008 I've employed over sixty people within my company we created a licensing agreements with other various vendors you know current and all sales tax on an offline and it's definitely something you know that that's brought a lot of positive I'm currently I'm originally from New York I moved back about a year and a half ago I kept my company based here in Rhode Island you know what laws like this it's nothing to move it across the board of the Massachusetts or even you know back to New York but that's not something I decided you know two years ago and I left doing great business in the state and you know we hope to continue to create that and again I we were the originators here it's just it's definitely a ploy on licensing and there's a lot more behind the licensing and and the restrictions then then what's stated inside of there so you know it's definitely a control play but we really think you just keep it federally and let the federal government you know handle what they said they were going to handle are there any other questions or comments for this witness thank you next we have Laura Akers okay my name is Laura and I'm the office manager for Sega teen and Providence I've been there for approximately two years I've considered what I could possibly say to you to get you to take a closer look at this bill and reconsider the passage of it or not passing it as it is written and in short at the end of the day this bill is a Trojan horse it looks great it comes in under the guise of we want to keep this product out of those that are under 18 and quite frankly we agree with that we have been doing it as Steve alluded to we the weak hard policy is definitely in effect with our company [Music] but passing the bill as it is written with all of these other things as the lady on the back row mentioned you know why all this other stuff in the bill basically I mean it is to restrict us it is to choke us out and at the end of the day who pays for that who who does that effect it's the Rhode Islanders that are affected by that and the reason is because it's there's a two-fold reason that having worked in this industry that I'm seeing all of our customers have one thing in common and that thing is that they are traditional smokers they have they have smoked cigarettes they've tried everything possible to quit smoking nothing is worked they began to learn about this product they're trying to part of it it works they're stopping smoking they're going to their doctors the doctors are now taking notice because their patients finally are quitting smoking the health of the patients is improving and then the word is beginning to spread now we have doctors calling us wanting to know about the product and are beginning to promote it to their patients because they see that it works and then stop and think about that for a minute and these economic times I will bet that the health care that the state of Rhode Island has to pay for those that can't provide their own health care insurance is sky-high and a huge expenditure in that has to be the coverage that is given to treat smoking related diseases and illnesses so if this bill is passed in the way that it is it's going to choke out electronic cigarette sells from the small companies it becomes more expensive one of the things is the adult signature verification when you send an online shipment that adds $5 to do that and I'm going to come back to that in a minute that adds $5 at that point it becomes cheaper for these people to go back to traditional cigarettes so that's something that to take an effect and then every as one or two of you on the front mention you're just not hearing about electronic cigarettes it is a business that is booming if you look at the records it's showing that this business is doubling in volume on a yearly basis across the board the electronic cigarette industry is with that said this company siga teen sitting here in Rhode Island that could have moved to another state but the owner chose to keep it here it is poison position to become a large contender in the electronic cigarette industry employing lots of people in the state of Rhode Island creating more revenue via sales tax for this for the state of Rhode Island so having said that if this bill passes as it is currently written Szigeti moves out of the state I don't have a job unemployment food stamps and you're paying my health care you know that that's a frightening thought and I'm asking you to please reconsider work with us work with work with electronic cigarette companies get in touch with the people that are residents of this state that will tell you amazing things about the product we all are in agreement we don't want this in the hands of anyone that is under 18 we've already been doing that without being told to do it we've been doing it it's packaged pretty it looks like it's all about don't sell it to those that are under 18 but there's more to this bill and to pass it and as it is written is really not good for the for the residents of Rhode Island at the end of the day it's big tobacco that will benefit if you pass this bill as it's written and we all know what happens all you have to do is look at past history when big tobacco benefits the rest of us were left holding the bag we pay the price for it so please reconsider are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you next we have Patricia Nolan good afternoon and welcome director thank you I'm no longer a director though it's nice to be back in front of you mr. chairman and members I will be brief because many of the concerns that I have have already been raised and quite eloquently by members of the committee as a public health professional and a physician I've strongly supported legislation and policies over the past decade and more to end the use of tobacco entirely it is still the number one preventable cause of death and of many acute and chronic diseases in our state I'm proud of what we all have done and particularly of what the legislature has done to continue to work on those problems my concerns about this bill are similar to those which you've raised I do have a couple of others I would like to mention one is that the bill doesn't although it defines these new products in the taxation section it does not include them under taxation I know the people next to me aren't anxious to do that but I think it's important not to close off your decisions about what will happen to these products as they come on to wide use and we get a better understanding of how they do affect health nicotine is not innocuous that's one of the reasons it's regulated as a prescription drug in many instances and in only controlled amounts when it's being used in patches and gum the the bill does also does not does something that's quite important to us in our ability to keep cigarettes and other products out of the hands of 18 and under I'm sorry under 18 years of age and that is it eliminates our current system of collecting data about those vendors who have been convicted and that interrupts the current system of graduated penalties for repeat endures and that is a very important part of our ability to keep store owners who repeatedly sell to minors from doing that so basically my view is a law that affirms that we do not want tobacco related products in the hands of our young people is an important thing to consider but we don't need these other clauses and provisions in this bill and I feel it would be a mistake to go forward with the bill in the way it is currently presented are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you thank you we do have a number of other witnesses signed up to testify on this bill a number of concerns have been raised by committee members we'll continue with the witnesses Corinna would Susan Roberts Erin Welch Megan Tucker we'll start on it I'll left you're right yes it's the Sun thank you hi I'm Karina Holly Oakwood and I'm the director of the Rhode Island tobacco control Network and I'm coming to testify in opposition to bill 622 I brought me with me a little visual show-and-tell I hope you'll indulge me just for a moment do you recognize this photograph I think everybody here is old enough to recognize it and I'll just show it to the folks behind buddy anybody I took this down from the wall of my offices conference room today because this is the tobacco industry CEOs lying under oath before Congress some years ago that there was no nicotine that they did not know that cigarettes the nicotine in cigarettes was addictive you may remember those famous congressional hearings and I just thought I'd bring it along today because I knew that we were going to be hearing from tobacco industry leaders today lobbyists and representatives here telling you that this bill is really just about prohibiting the sale and use of e-cigarettes and vapor products to youth when really as you've already heard this is a Trojan horse a stalking horse call it what you will it's a bill masquerading as a tobacco prevention strategy and a youth prevention strategy but really as you all have shown that you have very good reading abilities and some common sense and intelligence you have seen that the bill actually is stuffed full of other provisions that pertain to the control the regulation the taxation the definition and I'm not going to continue and raise repeat the points that have already been raised but just to say that my network which represents 50 different organizations statewide health community advocates and I will mention the ones who who specifically put their names on this statement that I gave you today are very much opposed to this bill the American Heart Association Amer can Stroke Association Cancer Action Network American Lung Association campaign for tobacco-free kids the Rhode Island Medical Society the partnership to reduce cancer in Rhode Island the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society the Rhode Island Public Health Institute the March of Dimes and also local prevention coalition's statewide barrington prevention coalition east providence prevention coalition Narragansett prevention coalition partnership and the North Kingstown Prevention Coalition and those are just a few that got in time because we were not fully aware that this hearing was happening till a couple of days ago but I would just urge you to if you want to ban the sale and the use of these products to under-18s let's just have a simple bill that says that that would be fine with us thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you you can proceed good evening this is Susan Roberts I am the director of government relations and advocacy for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network We strongly oppose this bill and its entirety and there are a couple things that we haven't addressed yet that I would like to address and one of those is this bill in its current form can actually prohibit or harm our current cleaner and or Air Act so right now when you go into restaurants you don't have people smoking around you and that's because of your good work you have taken care of your your constituents and within your state and we we praise you for that what we want to see done is to make sure that these products are under regulation by the federal tobacco Drug Administration that they're reviewed to see whether there's harm or not to not only the person that's using these products and not to believe the tobacco industry that's here today presenting but not just the folks that are using the products but those that are around because we don't know yet and the FDA doesn't know yet and that's why we have the FDA in place one of the things I'd like to also bring to your attention is if Big Pharma came into you and said hey we have a drug in the works FDA is reviewing it but hey we're going to go to the states and see if we can go ahead and set up statute to bypass and circumvent FDA that would be wrong and that's what's happening here so they're attempting to circumvent taxes they're attempting to circumvent regulation there they're putting it under the guise of protecting our youth don't buy it it is a longtime tobacco industry tactic please don't buy it I don't think you guys will you've asked a lot of great questions we really appreciate that and we hope that you'll pose this in its entirety one thing I do want to mention also is that there as Karina said we scrambled to get it word out about today and word is just now starting to really trickle in folks that are opposing this that I received information from last night Rhode Island State Nurses Association Leukemia Lymphoma Society chaplain Jim Woolsey the director of Spiritual Care Roger Williams Medical Center Rhode Island Council of Churches they're offended by this Rhode Island partnership to reduce cancer Joyce Staubach a cancer survivor Cheryl McKinney cancer survivor Ryan Bell more cancer caregiver Mary Preble a former smoker who lost one lung she says don't do this dr. Arnold Herman he's the clinical associate professor of surgery surgery at Brown University University he opposes Angela Tabor dr. Taber assistant professor of medicine and assistant program director hematology oncology so there are a lot of people that are hearing about this and they hope that you oppose thank you thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you you could proceed Thank You mr. chairman members of the committee my name is Megan Tucker I'm with the American Heart Association we are also opposed to this bill and for the sake of time I would just echo the comments of my colleagues and thank you very much thank you we appreciate your brevity are there any questions or comments thank you you can proceed oh good well I'll try and beat that my name is Erin bull's Welsh I'm the tobacco control manager for the Department of Health and I'm here on behalf of director dr. fine who regrets that he can't be here himself we respectfully oppose this bill is written although we wholeheartedly support the sponsors effort to ban these products from youth if an amendment were to be proposed we would certainly work to review that with the sponsor with the committee and advocates to ensure that such language would most directly address this issue and other than that we appreciate your in-depth consideration of this piece of legislation so thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness senator Archibald thank you sir chairman been listening patiently and I have to thank my my brother who always brings up great points and my sister and the other senators who are now out of the room for asking questions that discern between banning the use of these products on people under the age of 18 and the entirely different realm of uncertainty that we seem to be into on this unstable piece of proposed legislation where the FDA doesn't have any certainty so it seems to me to be something that not only is perhaps not entirely well thought out but something that could have some very very serious consequences health-wise and I really do get the intent of a Trojan horse coming in here and I I'm trying to really keep my mind objective but unconvinced it that this thing is shouldn't really be before us at this point and back to Senator hatch and I he kept going back to can't you just separate this and make it about banning these products for people 18 or younger and I didn't hear that question frankly adequately answered or over how articulate you were sir I didn't hear that that question answered sometimes the the loftiest questions can be answered in the simplest form and I didn't hear that answer so I really don't think this frankly should be before us are there any other comments or questions thank you the next group of witnesses we have a Rick McAuliffe Kerala Kerala frisk Angela Tabor dr. Arnold Herman Mary Preble we have a number of people signed up who are testifying who's here to testify on behalf of this bill against will come forward what do we do it that way and we're going to start with you mr. McAuliffe and getting a goal Thank You mr. chairman and members of committee I will be extremely brief because I know you've heard it from all sides I just make one comment Senator Archambault said that this bill was not thought out very well that's no it can't be a further from the truth this bill is a ruse this bill was directly used to set up future products in Rhode Island to not be taxed and to have to go every year to define a product to tax a product and so forth Big Tobacco does not come up from California lino because they're concerned about making sure that kids under 18 don't use this product this product costs over $100 to buy the kit there's not many kids that can afford that product this bill is used to set up and create different categories while it doesn't specifically mention taxation what it does do is it does bring forth different categories so every time something is introduced it would have to come back to the legislature whether it's a tax it or not it's no secret that tobacco is losing market share in terms of people that are smoking we've seen our revenue for tobacco decreased 50% in the last 10 years part of that reason is because you have taken action on higher tax on cigarettes the fact of the matter is we will now have a situation where when products come in they are going to be creating new electronic products electronic cigarettes and so forth obviously they're able to do that our concern quite frankly is that the intention of this bill was not to make sure that those under 18 don't use electronic cigarettes rather the bill was written to open up a hole to allow definitions of different products make no mistake about it as many attorneys up here much than I if you read this bill it creates separate categories which would allow every year for products to be introduced into the marketplace which won't be taxed which won't be categorized as tobacco unless you make that so while this legislation on the surface and Senator Hutchison's was completely right if it was just a simple bill to be in people under 18 to not use electronic cigarettes I don't think there's anyone in the room that would oppose this but the legislation wasn't intended for that reason this legislation was intended to drive a hole through this these are people who are very very good at what they do but the fact of the matter is this legislation is too big it's too broad and I was asked for your support to look at the bill and hopefully you can work with everyone to make it what it should be which is the ban electronic cigarettes for anyone under 18 years old thank you are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you you can proceed okay hear me okay my name is Lisa Chelonia and I live in Pawtucket Rhode Island and I've provided you a copy of a study that our as evidence that electronic cigarettes let me read it there is no existing evidence that youth and nonsmoker are using this product okay how about we start off don't over again sorry I respectfully oppose bills six twenty two and five eight seven six in its current form because I it poses extreme regulations to electronic cigarettes even though there is no evidence that non-smokers you use e cigs electronic cigarette companies and retailers support laws that be on sales to minors however one a one-page bill would be a sufficient gold would be sufficient to achieve this goal sorry more than twenty states have been the sales to electronic cigarettes to minors without making retailers in their customers subjected taxation laws such as the extreme regulations also the definitions the definitions of product derived tobacco derived product and vapor product contradict each other as the definition of tobacco derived product says it doesn't include a vapor product while vapor product definition says it must be a tobacco dried product the definition of vapor product in these bills also exempts the majority of e-cigarette products now on the market but determining which products will actually be covered by this definition of vapor products could result in years of conflict controversy and probably litigation plus not all electronic cigarettes contain nicotine regulations would force us sorry these regulations would force Rhode Island electronic cigarette retailers and businesses out of business because it requires them to obtain the tobacco license with the requirement they cannot only purchase they can only purchase their products from licensed wholesalers and distributors even though many electronic cigarettes retailers manufacturers in sorry cigarette Rita electronic cigarette retailer retailers manufacturers and importers directly market their product to consumers Rhode Island consumers this would deny Rhode Island ISA consumers from purchasing the best majority of products now available on the market because they aren't going to be sold by tobeco dealers in Rhode Island this bill would also increase unnecessary cost both to the retailer and the consumer by adding it as a tobacco product to be taxed as such by rakaat sorry by requiring a government-issued ID and adult signature with every online order on shipment this will also make it impossible for the people who already use these products such as myself in the state of Rhode Island to legally purchase what they need to continue being tobacco free I see this as a direct threat to the consumers and the public health in Rhode Island especially when millions of people including myself have successfully stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes due to the fact that ecigs work and because these products are available to them by restricting the ecig users from getting what they need to keep them free from smoking tobacco cigarettes is a real crime here I urge you to reject sorry I urge you to recheck the bub for the public health of Rhode Island and for the people who use these products like myself to stay smoke-free are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you good evening and welcome hi my name is Spike Bob and I am president of national vapors club we're an e-cigarette consumer organization and we protect the rights of people who use e-cigarettes to continue not smoking I had a couple of things I wanted to say obviously most of them are already covered this is my 27th a cigarette hearing to either ban or stop or stop indoor use or whatever with these cigarettes so I just want to take briefly that it's really nice to see legislators who are reasonably intelligent and competent and are able to read a bill for what it is because I'm really tired of having to explain it to people right now there are over a hundred people in Oklahoma about two hours ago fighting this same legislation by Reynolds American and I expect that they will come out the same way we will briefly I just want to show you what electronic cigarettes look like they do not all look like cigarettes they look very different all of them look different hookah Zi pipe see whatever they do not produce a smell they do not make any smoke we've already gone over that so I'm not going to give you too much more of that there are two studies that I gave to them two hand T one of them there was not enough copies of but I will bring back enough copies when you try to pass an indoor band that says these cigarettes cannot be used indoors because that study is one that I am an author on and that study shows that e-cigarettes do not produce smoke and do not produce the components that are in smoke so we'll worry about that when that bill comes up because I'm sure that it will in the meantime in reference to this bill 622 there are two federally approved age verification systems that you can use online that you can send your ID to them and they approve you and all you have to do is then when you go to buy something online that you need to be age verified for that you can get approved there are only two of them supposedly that are recognized by the federal government but you can use them for online purchases when you're over 18 you have to first send them identification to go through a whole process and once you're approved you purchase these items through this website that allows you to say yes this person is approved that they're over 18 it might be an option for some way to restrict online sales to people who are over 18 obviously national vapors club fully supports sales to people only who are over 18 people who use e-cigarettes oftentimes are sick they've had emphysema they've had COPD they have difficulty breathing they have a lot of health issues they may not be able to come to the door to sign for a package that comes to their door this is a big concern for us because our members say well what if I'm not home what if I can't get up what if I can't get out of my chair what if I'm on my oxygen tank and I can't go to the door how will I get my e-cigarette liquid these people cannot smoke their doctors have told them you cannot smoke you must not smoke you're on oxygen you'll explode yourself if you fight a cigarette while you're on oxygen they don't have the ability to go out to a store and go by you say they have to be at home they're homebound or they're bound to wherever they're hot whatever hospital they're in they need to be able to purchase their electronic cigarette supplies or they go back to smoking many of them do we don't want to see that happen obviously so when this bill is amended and hopefully eventually passed to restrict sales to minors please bear in mind that people need to be able to access the product adults who are smoked former smokers need to be able to have easy access to the product because it's a lot easier to go to the corner store and buy a pack of cigarettes and you don't want to see that happen it also needs to be something that's less cost prohibitive to the vendors I know $5.00 does not seem like a large amount when you're saying oh it's only $5 for adult age verification or adult signature required but that's a lot of money when the person is buying an $8 refill package and they have to pay $5 for adults are occasionally and that's not fair to the user because a lot of people use it because they're on Social Security because they're on disability because they have health problems and they can't afford cigarettes so that's also something that has to be kept in mind and please keep that in mind when you do pass taxation laws on electronic cigarettes while we do understand that you're losing a lot of money state wise for not having people smoke anymore bear in mind that a healthier product deserves a lower tax because people have to be encouraged to use it instead of smoking cigarettes I think that's pretty much all I have to say so I'll leave it at that and with any questions are there any questions or comments for this witness thank you sure hi mr. chairman senators my name is Lou del sasso I just recently opened historical ecig shed in Banton Rhode Island we've been open about eight weeks we sell electronic cigarettes like this you know stuff like that liquids to put them in 24 milligrams 18 11 and 0 I've been finding a lot of people come to the my shop it's like I'm actually the manager my mozi honor but unwanted running the place and they just tried everything they've tried Nicorette gum the tried chantix had bad reactor to chantix at bad reactions with the patch can't quit smoking they come here this is like almost like a last resort inside I didn't want try electronics but I got to give it a shot and they come back from there just amazed and it's smoked in weeks and weeks and weeks it's actually I'm surprised we're doing so well so soon you know it's and I'm really afraid that this SP six to two is going to put a stop to all that it's going to shut me down I'm afraid that it's going to limit what I can bring into the store to help not only myself make a living help my family but also help people get off cigarettes I mean cigarettes almost killed my fellows killed me it smoked two packs a day two years ago I got the flu ended up getting bronchitis turned into pneumonia and the doctor says if you didn't come a few know if you stayed a few more days at home just hack in with that pneumonia I would have died and he said it was from the two packs a day smoking so I feel really strong about e-cigarettes this style that style whatever you want you know look at what an e-cigarette is it pretty much saved my life and if it comes to an end a lot of people are going to be going back to cigarettes then it's going to hurt them that so it comes down to are there any questions or comments for this witness senator Archibald excuse me what do you think makes the e-cigarette work so well gentlemen business owner earlier it stated that it's the habit over the actual physical addictive properties those were creatures of habit what you can amplify on that I mean that things work so that's part of it I mean so you know the nicotine's are no thing they're looking for but you know at the point you know I start off in 24 milligrams work my way down to a 18 down to 12 now I'm at about 10 10 milligrams I don't we keep on working my way down to zero and eventually it's just the oral fixation thing you know I mean as everybody knows it's hard just to go cold turkey it is a way to you know get down while you're enjoying it and then get down to zero that's what a lot of people doing I'm bringing more and more zeros because that's what people are doing they want you know at first I only had a few zeros you know zero milligram liquids you know all different flavors and now I'm just buying more and more and more because that's what people want to do they want to just get off nicotine and it's working for them it really is now that the patch didn't work for me the gum didn't work for me chantix made me crazy you know so yeah I mean it was nuts it's the only thing that works for me two years ago I mean I was a two pack a day smoker the day I started it was a little bit more like a cigarette looking thing there's a cheap one from Walmart a day of started it's been two years the day I started that's quit smoking tobacco it really works yeah are there any other questions or comments for this witness thank you thank you does anyone else wish to speak on this bill with that Senator body moves to hold for further studies seconded by Senator Nestle Bush all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills held for further study the next bill will do with Senator with Jay Rios bill bill number 493 we have a number of witnesses here to speak on 493 patty octo Gail wolf Tim Duffy and Hillary Davis you can proceed miss davyss Thank You chairman members of the committee you have our written testimony in front of you in support of this legislation and so I won't spend your time rehashing it but I do want to just talk about a couple of things social media as we all are well aware is becoming more and more ubiquitous amongst all of us and unfortunately what we're seeing nationwide is that they're becoming more and more situations in which individuals are being required by their employers or by their schools or their potential employers or potential schools to disclose certain social media information sometimes that includes being required to give over their passwords other times it includes being required to log in to their social media accounts in the presence of an employer or a school official the bill that's in front of you would restrict those instances and make sure that individuals private social media rights are protected now I want to make it clear that this applies to individuals where an individual social media is password protected so if something is public and individual any individual can see it but if an individual has chosen to password protect that account for whatever reason they cannot be compelled to give over access to their employer or to their school we're seeing legislation pop up all over the country it's currently in four states in different forms I know it's been introduced in others and just to give you a we have some examples in Oklahoma a police department was requiring applicants to turn over their Facebook passwords as part of a background check in New York there was a statistician who I believe sued because his password information was being required as part of his job schools around the country requiring student athletes to friend or connect with their coaches in a number of other situations this bill will allow employers to access the social media account when there is some suspicion of wrongdoing in a couple of situations but otherwise largely protects individuals password information from being productive I can answer any questions do you have any questions or comments for this witness I know what other people signed up to testify and on their sign-up sheets they indicated they may be at other hearings in the building as well as they have some suggested changes to the legislation when I asked them maybe you sit down with them to try and work out some of those differences with that settlement body moves to hold for further study second by Senator Archibald all in favor signify by saying aye opposed the bills help for further study the next bills will do a bill number for 68 and 655 one is by son of the Fogerty that deals with background checks and the other is by Senator Miller and it deals with background checks we have number of people signed up to testify on the bills Joey led back of the Department of the Attorney General Paul Valletta of the Ryland State Association of firefighters and Hilary Davis of the ACLU good evening and welcome Paul Thank You mr. chair members of the committee Paul Valletta with the Rhode Island State Association of firefighters were against
1qool5T3cb0,07-08-2015,3138,CA,"that it's electronic cigarettes used a liquid nicotine mixture derived from tobacco and that its products are not marketed for therapy uses so they won their case against the FDA that they were a tobacco product they also fall into the federal definition of a tobacco product federal definition for tobacco products enacted by law and promulgated by regulation is quote the term tobacco product means any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption this is the definition in our bill additionally FDA has decided that a cigarette should be deemed a tobacco product and they have proposed regulations that are pending currently and should be finalized hopefully before the end of the summer and then there are the statements made by the industry itself they on their advertisements and I could show you some of them right here this is r.j. Reynolds vapor innovative digital tobacco product they advertise on their own website they are a tobacco product reading from their website page the Food and Drug Administration is expected to regulate electronic cigarettes views is a tobacco product under federal law they do not burn tobacco but rather heat liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco I refer back to the definition under federal law a tobacco product means any product made or derived from tobacco nicotine comes from tobacco these are tobacco products and they're illegal to sell to minors in California but they're being marketed to minors in California products with the name gummy bear Mountain Dew cotton candy they are marketing to our children and addicting them to nicotine this is the reason I am here colleagues I'm not here to make any kind of political point or any other kind of point this is a serious health issue California has invested over two billion dollars and twenty five years to lower tobacco usage tobacco products according to the World Health Organization were responsible for the deaths eight over eight percent of all deaths worldwide caused by tobacco products in the past year in the United States alone over four hundred and forty thousand Americans died because of tobacco usage in the past year put that into some context for you four hundred and forty thousand Americans died from tobacco use that's more than from alcohol cocaine heroin homicide suicide fires car accidents and AIDS combined and they are marketing to our children so I know this is a disagreement that I have with the chair on this but I just hope that you will seriously consider the importance of the issue before you today we are in agreement that cigarette cigarettes should fall under the safe smoking rules within California we agree on that we agree that they should comply with the stake Act which is an acronym for stop tobacco access to kids Enforcement Act which allows for sting operations and have cut the illegal sales of traditional cigarettes from 55 percent down to 8 percent so that's all good and well but it's no small difference of opinion whether these are tobacco products or not because if they're not tobacco products big tobacco can continue to market their non tobacco product to our children and why do I say big tobacco because Wells Fargo securities has already stated that beyond the end of the decade big tobacco will own over 75% of the e-cigarette industry capture what's going on here Big Tobacco has long sought a safer delivery system that's their word a safer delivery system for their addictive toxic nicotine I don't know if you were around in the 1970s I was the safer delivery system for their toxic addictive nicotine was filtered cigarettes we all paid the price because decades later it was revealed they knew quite well how dangerous their filtered cigarettes were in the case of Kent micro night filters they were using a bestest so I'm not here to tell you what they know or don't know today but they don't want this to be regulated as a tobacco product for obvious reasons this bill contains no suggestion of a taxation on e-cigarettes that is not a part of this bill but as long as they are deemed non tobacco products Board of Equalization or any other taxing body cannot will not tax them but this bill as it is before you today does not even refer to taxation so that's not the debate today the debate before you is whether you agree with the Food and Drug Administration with the World Health Organization with the Centers for Disease can control the Cancer Society the American Lung Association the American Cancer excuse me the American Heart Association the police chiefs Association their narcotics Association the CMA every Health Organization is here to support this bill as a tobacco product so thank you for the opportunity to have an honest debate here I appreciate that very much but I just want you to look at the facts and look at what's happening and if you care about the health and the future of our children it's a lot about the health of our children that we're here today I hope you'll agree with why we're doing what we're doing so with that I would like to introduce our speakers we have a number of physicians here who will speak to the issue at hand dr. Michael on will lead as associate professor at UCLA dr. Michael Liu sac is with Kaiser Permanente I would like them introduce the City Attorney of Los Angeles our former colleague like Fuehrer's with us and then our fourth and last mr. chair presenter will be John level on behalf of the California narcotic Officers Association and the California police chiefs Association why law enforcement supports this bill as a tobacco product I thank you very much for your attention dr. on Thank You senator Leno so my name is Michael long I'm an associate professor at UCLA and I also am the chair for the state of California tobacco education research every site committee the committee actually has already sent in a letter in support of senator Leno's bill and part of the reason why is because the committee itself supports the treatment of electronic cigarettes as tobacco products and as Senator Leno stated this would be consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration and other key organizations that monitor health and healthcare I think that it is imperative to think about why it is such an urgent issue to focus on electronic cigarettes at this time rather than the furring action so in the state health officers report on electronic cigarettes that was issued earlier this year there are several key findings that I think that are important based on other studies that have been going on in the United States in 2014 teen use of electronic cigarettes surpassed the use of traditional cigarettes for the first time with more than twice as many eighth and tenth graders reporting using electronic cigarettes than traditional cigarettes and among 12th graders 17 percent reported currently using electronic cigarettes versus 14 percent using traditional cigarettes and in California while adults using electronic cigarettes in the past 30 days doubled from 1.8 percent in 2012 to 3.5% in 2013 for young adults aged 18 to 29 years old electronic cigarette use tripled in only one year from 2.3 percent to 7.6% I have to say that for our committee we interact with the Department of Education and we have heard quite consistently that within school districts they are highly concerned about the use of electronic cigarettes among their youth while sales as Senator Leno mentioned are restricted from children they still are able to obtain them and so when we do not have the means to regulate electronic cigarettes as we do with tobacco products it makes it all that much more difficult to prevent these individuals from getting addicted I think that it is also important to remind everyone that nicotine is a highly addicting substance it is known Thaksin it's actually on the proposition 65 list of chemicals that are restricted due to either causing cancer birth defects and other reproductive harm and the main reason why is because nicotine actually affects the cardiovascular system so in terms of its leading cause of death this includes both cancer as well as heart attacks and strokes and so what if we don't act on electronic cigarettes at this point I think that what we would unfortunately be doing is causing suffering among all the future generations of Californians I have to say as a practicing physician when I work with people with tobacco related diseases when they look back on their decades of having smoked they all wish that they didn't do it but unfortunately they you know when you start using an addicting substance that you're not actually informed well about it becomes very difficult to make a choice when you have a lot of peer pressure so I think that in terms of focusing on the health of future Californians I think that it is important for us to focus on electronic cigarettes and to treat them as tobacco products and I agree with what senator Leno has already mentioned already thank a doctor doctor good afternoon my name is Michael Luczak I'm an emergency physician with Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento and Roseville I also hold faculty appointment at the UC Davis Medical School you may be wondering why would an emergency physician come and testify about this bill and I'd like to share with you my experience as a medical student decades ago when I was rotating in a primary care clinic during this rotation my preceptor ruthlessly emphasized smoking cessation and had all kinds of smoking cessation efforts programs and worked very very hard to get his patients enrolled and get them to stop smoking and one one afternoon after clinic I asked him why he emphasized this so much and he explained to me that he felt that when when we do a successful cardiac resuscitation in the emergency department or in other settings the patient is likely to only have a few years because of the burden of their disease but if he could get someone to stop smoking that the intervention that he achieved would buy them years decades more of quality life so the reality is in the emergency department even when we're successful and we can resuscitate someone from a cardiac arrest their their likelihood of leaving the hospital and surviving is less than 10% because that advanced disease is already present as as my colleague pointed out in contrast if we can get patients to stop smoking or prevent them from smoking we're adding decades to their their quality of life your decision here today will save lives many more lives then then my emergency medicine colleagues and I will ever save during resuscitations in the emergency department we know that California is a leader in tobacco cessation and prevention we already have one of the lowest youth smoking rates in the nation promotion and is increasing use of e-cigarettes however and that threatens this success in my opinion these are electronic nicotine delivery devices and they must be regulated east cigarettes are addicting an entire new generation of young people to nicotine we're also seeing accidental poisonings with children with four children with nicotine and it's increasing dramatically over the last few years secondhand aerosol emissions adversely impact public health just the way secondhand smoke does and and and in the reality of our fiscally constrained times fiscal responsibility demands that the taxpayer not bear the burden of the cost resulting from damage to public health from these devices nicotine is a highly addictive drug cigarettes are drug delivery devices East cigarettes do not emit water vapor they emit a mixture of toxic chemicals which are used to suspend the toxic substance toxic and clear Atta genic so birth defect causing substance of nicotine in an aerosol for delivery to the users the e-cigarette aerosol not only contains that teratogenic substance the birth defect causing substance nicotine but numerous other carcinogens and chemicals known to cause birth defects there are no studies demonstrating that e-cigarettes are helpful in helping patients smokers quit studies have indicated 89% of these cigarette users are still using them a year after starting and other studies indicate that e-cigarette users are one-third less likely to quit cigarettes than people who don't use these cigarettes I urge you to help protect users and non-users of e-cigarettes from the health risks associated with these dangerous products the proposed bill Senate bill 140 with the new FDA proposed ruling defining e-cigarettes as tobacco products and in my mind these are clearly tobacco products any standard toxicology reference looking at nicotine as a toxin nicotine is a naturally occurring toxic chemical found in tobacco plants it's not found anywhere else and when you look at the toxicities associated with nicotine they are the same toxicities as we see and are treated like nerve agent this is in fact a hazardous hazardous material and the tox textbooks talk about approaching it as a hazmat incident if there's a spillage the fiscally responsible course is to minimize the burden on California taxpayers that results from the adverse effects of e-cigarettes but more importantly your decision here today will save lives thank you doctor say the attorney thank you very much senator Leno good afternoon committee it's great to see so many former colleagues and friends here it's very weird to be sitting in this chair as I make this presentation so I am the City Attorney of Los Angeles I'm like fewer I have an office of about 900 people in it we have about 10 offices throughout the city we perform a range of tasks we write every law in the city we advise on every legal issue our office defends the city when its we represent the city in affirmative litigation and we prosecute tens of thousands of cases every year I'm here today in my capacity as the office in charge of tobacco enforcement in the city of Los Angeles in that role our office drafts legislation we enforce the law by prosecution other means we train law enforcement we have a contract with the California Department of Health Services to conduct the undercover investigations the stings that are referred to in the steak act we educate businesses and the public I've been in office for two years in those two years we've reduced underage smoking by 25 percent in Los Angeles I'm here today to talk about our experience with this issue Los Angeles for the last year and a half has adopted a rule nearly identical to that which Senator Leno proposes and SB 140 I want to talk about why we did that and what our experience has been with that and the hope that will illuminate these issues for the committee before we adopted the ordinance in our role as the oversees of tobacco issues in Los Angeles we got a number of complaints from different sources we got complaints before regulation from individuals involved education system in my city for example one school principal reported to us the confiscation on one afternoon of 6te cigarettes from his middle school students we saw we heard complaints from parents in particular about e-cigarettes in public locations we heard from workers concerned about the effects of e-cigarettes in the locations where they worked on their free future health and we heard from business owners who weren't clear about what the rules were regarding e-cigarettes and how they could accommodate their patrons who didn't wish to be subjected to secondhand vapor from a cigarette at the same time as we heard those complaints each cigarette outlets were proliferating throughout our city so we made a decision we made the decision that in the absence of any scientific evidence that e-cigarettes are safe and given the concerns that have been expressed by many public health advocates about the normalization of smoking behavior by having e-cigarettes present in public locations we took the precautionary approach and adopted as I mentioned that regulates these cigarettes precisely as we as we regulate other tobacco related products now that experience has yielded variety of results first workers are protected now they're not involuntarily subjected to e cigarette vapor we've decreased the environments in which families are subjected to secondhand vapor from a cigarette our office no longer gets complaints about e-cigarettes maybe one or two as opposed to dozens and dozens our office has worked with businesses they're delighted to now have clear rules about these issues so they can be sure that the patrons on whom they rely continue to return we haven't had any community for compliance issues brought forward to our office in a year and a half and not the slightest effort to roll back our legislation in the city of Los Angeles in other words it's been a resounding success from the standpoint of the business community from parents from schools from everyone in the city so why is state action needed on this issue it shouldn't be that whether you are subjected and whether your kids are subjected to secondhand vapor from the e-cigarettes depends on where you live in the state a child's health is a child's health a pregnant woman's health is a pregnant woman's health someone who is a vulnerable person to these kinds of vapors shouldn't have to determine where to be in our state based on the faculty this patchwork of rules throughout California I want to underscore as in mr. Leno's bill in Los Angeles we're not saying you can't have a cigarette you can use them but you simply use them in the same locations as you're permitted to use tobacco products now I also want to point out by the way that mr. Leno's bill is an important thing it extends the stake act to e-cigarettes why does that matter I can mean a meeting with a range of enforcement agencies state and local enforcement agencies just yesterday on this issue and to a person every enforcement entity in that room said the same thing and that is in the absence of stake act extension to e-cigarettes their work is undermined in their effort to prove kids from getting involved with East cigarettes and smoking generally you've heard the statistics about the tremendous escalation and e-cigarette use among kids but there's no stake act skiing operations pursuant to that right now because the Act doesn't go that far very important to do that I'll conclude with this there are a number of opponents arguments that have been raised one of those arguments is well addressed by our public health experts to my left emissions from e-cigarettes it has argued are just like water vapor and nothing could be further from the truth at least 10 carcinogenic elements in the aerosol that is emitted from a cigarettes there's not a single independent peer-reviewed study that says anything other than that opponents gonna argue that e-cigarette restrictions are going to discourage people from engaging in this ostensible tobacco cessation activity but again let's be real listen to our own state experts of the Department of Public Health for example who say there is no evidence that links tobacco cessation with ecig arete use let me talk about something else I want to address the issue as I wind up here of the definition of what an e-cigarette is precisely the changes that change the amendment that is proposed today was proposed in our city it was proposed by the e-cigarette industry and we rejected it and I'll tell you why we rejected it in part because of the reasons that Senator Leno indicated we rejected it because the fed the FDA is on the verge of adopting a rule that is precisely the opposite of that our National Health Affairs just the opposite and we knew that was coming even a year and a half ago that was on its way we does it because of potential confusion by the way so is this an e-cigarette or is this a traditional cigarette I bet you no one from your vantage point could tell what the answer to that question is same is true of enforcement entities in your jurisdictions the people who brought you up here are going to confront the same challenges in enforcement this looks like any cigarette this looks like a cigarette we're very few moments in the role of a state legislator where one has the opportunity to take a meaningful tangible step to protect public health to advance the cause of businesses who need certainty on this issue throughout our state to establish a set of meaningful reasonable consistent rules and act consistently with the federal government all at the same time this is one of those moments that's why I flew up here that's why I endured a canceled flight and raced to another airline just to get up here because the experience in Los Angeles has been so successful on this issue I can only hope that others in the state can benefit from the same approach mr. chair members thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today mr. chair members of the committee my name is John Lovell and I'm here on behalf of the California police chiefs Association the California narcotic Officers Association and the California college and university police chiefs Association one of the alarming trends with a cigarette has been their exponential increase among children and let's be real this is not a product that is delivering anything healthy to children the you can buy cartridges on the internet that contain a hundred milligrams of nicotine now to put that into context an individual cigarette is what ten 15 milligrams of nicotine so this is this is tobacco products on steroids the other disturbing trend that we have seen is that e-cigarettes are being used as a delivery system for illegal drugs you are seeing cigarettes used and if you go on the internet you'll see people even bragging about it used as a delivery system for butane hash oil which is a 90 percent THC product now people will tell you well it's illegal to sell e-cigarettes to children and that's true but there isn't an effective enforcement mechanism under current law to actualize that prohibition one of the things that is critical about this bill is that it brings a cigarette where they are where they ought to be under the rubric of the steak Act which enables us to use all of the various strategies that we've used to successfully reduce tobacco use before the steak Act tobacco use among children I mean the rate of illegal sales was up at the 50 percent mark it's now down to about five percent we need to have that same strategy for yet another tobacco product and that's why the groups I recommend that I represent strongly support this legislation okay thank you all for your testimony and support at this time we'll take any testimony in opposition to the measure one else in support well do we have other supporters that want to add

for your testimony well conservative text it's alright good afternoon mr. chairman and honorable committee members my name is Eric Beale and for 17 years I was a pack and a half a day tobacco smoker until I switched to a safer alternative vapor product no longer am I inhaling harmful tobacco smoke all day long or subjecting my loved ones and the public around me to deadly secondhand tobacco smoke I am here today as the volunteer legislative advisor for the California Chapter of Sephora the smoke free alternatives trade association as you may be aware there are approximately fourteen hundred retailers and also hundreds of manufacturers distributors and others who make up the California vapor product market not to mention the vapor product consumers who have finally found an alternative to combustible tobacco use first off I would like to be clear that spoda is willing to engage in discussions on the following topics strengthening prohibitions on selling to minors ensuring safe and child-resistant packaging consistent with federal standards and developing licensure requirements that are reasonable appropriate to our products and not overly burdensome but SB 140 s inclusion of vapor products in California's existing definition of tobacco is directly counterproductive to fair and reasonable progress in crafting public policy to address innovative products such as e-cigarette and vapor products in fact we know that the existing statutory definition of electronic cigarettes and vapor products could productively be used to advance such goals there is no need to define vapor products as tobacco under state law we are supportive of the committee's proposed amendments to delete the language defining the industry and these products as tobacco as that is our fundamental concern if the bill moves forward we would like to work on the remaining issues related to age verification for online purchases the birth of our industry was driven by the desire to develop radically different and substantially less harmful to combustible tobacco it is important to our membership and our customers that an appropriate distinction be maintained additionally from a sheer common sense and scientific perspective there is little doubt that there are key differences between products currently defined as tobacco products or vapor products and to address the testimony the gentleman before me asking whether you could differentiate a tobacco product or a vapor product and he held up something that looked like a cigarette and then a cig like this is a vapor product okay it's quite different than a combustible tobacco cigarette vapor products were invented to be marketed towards smokers wanting to become non-smokers the smoke free tobacco free and often nicotine free products are not tobacco products and classifying them as such does send a confusing and inaccurate message to smokers still battling tobacco vapor products are one of the most revolutionary products we have ever seen and they provide immense opportunity for harm reduction and our opposition letter references several studies on this point in conclusion on behalf of sue Fattah we ask you to focus on public policy solutions that are thoughtfully calibrated to address this class of products and to oppose SB 140 s flawed approach thank you good afternoon chairman gray vice-chair Linder and distinguished members of the committee my name is gregory connelly i am here today on behalf of a nonprofit organization called the american vaping association which advocates for small and medium sized businesses and the vapor product and electronic cigarette markets next month on august 10th I will be celebrating five years as an ex-smoker for on nine years I was a very dedicated smoker and the patch gum laws and all failed me like they fail about 93 to 97 percent of people that use them each year once I quit I became very interested in this subject and spent three years as a volunteer consumer or rather volunteer legislative director for the US as largest consumer group representing around 60,000 consumers of vapor products almost all of whom are ex smokers I am here today to strongly urge you to reject SB 140 as passed by the Senate because its enactment threatens over 1,400 small businesses in California that are employing California citizens occupying what may otherwise be empty storefronts paying sales and unemployment taxes and most importantly providing effective smoke-free alternatives to California's 3.6 million adult smokers this state has made great progress in reducing smoking but again 3.6 million adult smokers remain let's be clear as my colleague stated this industry does not oppose and does not oppose additional regulations designed to strengthen California's existing sales ban to minors there are great options available including applying the the portions of the stake act that allow for sting operations to these products without defining us as tobacco it boggles the mind to think that just because something is defined as tobacco that that will somehow reduce usage if when it's not defined as tobacco you are still doing Axew at youth access enforcement sting operations etc and we strongly encourage that to become law however we oppose trying to fit a square peg into a round hole which is exactly what this bill would do by defining these products as tobacco there were four points I will just respond to a couple very quickly in the federal case trying to prevent successfully the FDA from banning e-cigarettes four or five years ago and joy never said we are a tobacco product and joy said there is an option out there a potential option and in dicta in the district court's decision in DC judge Leon did note that that is a possibility for the future Altria and Reynolds they are tobacco companies you're all familiar with them yes they make e-cigarettes but they do not represent this industry this industry was created by ex smokers who use these products to quit we do not really respect them and we do not take their labels as somehow applicable to our products and lastly this bill would make nicotine-free eliquid x' devices that are sold without nicotine they would make all of these tobacco products the federal FDA regulation would not unless a product contains nicotine or it is sold alongside nicotine it will not be a tobacco product but in this bill it would be so in California and before and just to wrap it up I urge you this some of the committee amendments are certainly better than what we have in SB 40 is proposed however I urge you to look at two issues very closely one if we do not make these tobacco products the exemption for smoking in a retail tobacco store no longer applies so a Amendment saying that vaping in vapor stores is permitted just as smoking is permitted in retail tobacco stores those that would be greatly appreciated also age verification for online sales if you require a six dollar thing for every single order where the postman has to check the ID of the person ordering what you're going to have is thousands of California consumers ordering from companies in Virginia in New Jersey in North Carolina and the California AG or the California the Department of Health will be at a loss for enforcing that meanwhile California companies will comply and they will suffer their revenue will go down there this is a 21st century there are better methods for age verification than for every single order requiring the person to be at home when the order comes to sign and show their ID vapor products are changing lives every day in Californian across the nation we know from studies state funded studies Minnesota and Oklahoma the most the most used quit smoking product in that state and I would bet my entire savings account that the same is true in California today so please do not over regulate this growing industry that is helping Californians every day thank you and I would be thrilled to answer any questions that you have okay there are any other any other testimony in opposition at this time seeing none I'll bring it back to the do we have some meters [Music]

strongly oppose this bill okay seeing no more opposition let me begin the discussion senator by commending you for your work in this area I know a number of legislators have brought similar measures some of the provisions were discussing today before this body in the past few years it's clearly an important public policy discussion and there's broad support and opposition on your particular measure in your opening comments you focused on what I think's the more important point which is that there's broad agreement certainly between myself and and the proposed committee amendments and and much of what you're trying to do there is a point of contention over the definition and let me just for the consideration of the members in the discussion quickly review the proposed committee amendments the first one is the area of disagreement striking the definition of tobacco product using the Health and Safety Code definition in its place which still allows us to deal with the licensure and smoke-free laws the consumer protections and public health issues this second amendment requiring age verification upon mail delivery of e-cigarettes the third prohibiting East cigarettes from being sold offered for sale or distributed from a vending machine and the fourth requiring child-resistant packaging of e-cigarettes this is a provision currently an SB 438 by Senator Hale I think it's a good provision I think the addition of those provisions strengthen the bill and with the adoption of all of the committee amendments you'll certainly have my support here today and I would hope broader support here in the committee with that I'm going to open it up for discussion I see mr. pariah will recognize you first Thank You mr. chair like the chair to the author I just want to commend you on on the work that you're doing on this bill I think I mean you're no stranger to difficult issues and this is certainly one of those and so I want to thank you for the work that you're that you're doing on this and I apologize I missed most of the testimony I think I came in towards the end of the video sent your office I think I came in towards the end of yours which you said something that I wanted to ask you if you could expand a little bit more because I think it goes to this idea this question of the definitions that really seems to be the bone of contention here's you know this you know should this should these products be defined as the same way as as tobacco products you had a device that you used that said that they had doesn't have nicotine in it can you I'm not I don't understand the vaping world so I don't know what what what this is all about but can you just talk a little bit about a little bit more about the different types of devices types that don't have nicotine some that do I mean can you just explain to me a little more this industry when it was built there were some that wanted to use e-cigarettes to not only get off cigarettes but also get themselves off of nicotine and so from 2009 onwards air have been nicotine free products and so you have as the alt Riyaz and Reynolds of the world they only sell nicotine containing products their products look like cigarettes they contain cartridges and they are by the different color from cigarettes they are shaped just like them now the vapor product industry all the people behind us all use products like this you buy e liquid this one does have a child-resistant cap that would comply with the amendment and you buy tanks or other things that you put the liquid in and you buy the device separately and from the looks of it FDA regulation of vapor products will only be covering products that are sold as containing nicotine or a component of a product that is sold with nicotine and so there are a lot of unanswered questions about what exactly will be a tobacco under federal law but it appears plainly clear to me as an attorney who studied the Tobacco Control Act for many years that the devices themselves if they do not contain nicotine as well as nicotine free eliquids will not be tobacco products but under SB 140 as passed by the Senate they would be do we know when the FDA will be coming out with their the rules they are now saying end of summer early fall it had been June but there are a lot of issues there's a Congress is actually dealing with some of it right now there's a lot of concern that the FDA regulation if it has not changed could end up pretty much putting every small business in this room out of business so there's a lot of FDA is really concentrating really looking at the evidence so but under the current bill is proposed products and maybe this is a question the author products with or without nicotine would be classified as tobacco thank you for letting me respond to some blamin so first of all there are claims that there are east cigarettes without nicotine but this is an unregulated industry so claims may not be true and in fact there are peer-reviewed respected studies led by Stanley Glantz professor at University of California San Francisco which have documented that products that claim to have no nicotine in fact contain nicotine so that's point one point two if they are cessation devices and I want to say Bravo sincerely to all these folks who came today to say that they have not used cigarettes since they've used e-cigarettes and that they're clearly cessation devices well the end joy lawsuit notwithstanding where they argue that they were tobacco products and won that case that not withstanding if they are cessation devices it's as simple as the industry making application to the Food and Drug Administration to become a cessation device but they haven't done that and there not proposing to do that and if they do and I encourage them to do so if they are sincere clearly these would be the ones without nicotine make your case go to the FDA and if you become a cessation device this bill as written will not impact you because this only deals with tobacco products not cessation devices but there's a way to become a cessation device and this industry has not pursued that path well thank you for that response I appreciate that I mean I've really I've really struggled with this bill and it's mostly around the definition I think you know colleagues I think it would be a mistake not to do something in this arena I think we've seen this bill so many times and different versions I think we should begin to address the issue I just wonder if you know based on the author's comments based on the comments from the opposition and what the FDA may or may not do I just wonder if if if leaving the definition piece out is okay for now to allow some of these other things to occur I mean if in fact there is no regulation or no standard that proves some products have nicotine or some don't you know maybe you ought to be talking a little bit about that I mean I mean I don't know I just sort of throw that out as an idea not necessarily to apply in this bill but just sort of something to think about and so I mean look I I know that you know as authors our bills always get amended and certainly I think every single one it might has been amended in the last two weeks taking out very critical pieces that I thought were important two things I was trying to advocate for but having said that I do think it would be a mistake not to do something in this arena and not to move a bill forward and so you know listening to the chairs of men's I think those are I think they're I think it's more than than a halfway point I think I think in your particular measure you achieve what a lot of other people have not been able to achieve I know it's not everything but it to me it would seem like a lot so I would be supportive of moving the bill as amended in fact I would make a motion to that effect okay we have a motion to the author to decide if that's something the other wants to accept but I'm certainly willing to put a motion on the table to move this bill forward as amended by the chair because I do think it makes a lot of important changes it doesn't get at that sort of the heart and the big piece of the definition but I'm not sure I'm there yet on the definition I'm not saying that I wouldn't be there down the road I just think that there are still a few innings that still need to be played before we make a hard decision on that particular piece so that would be my motion Thank You mr. chairman I respond to the Assemblyman just one second senator we have a motion we have a second by mr. Gibson we have a third by mr. Bigelow without objection members we can just adopt the amends but to return to the Senators point that would return us to the main question of the bill senator and to mr. parez point would you want to proceed further I would like to first of all could we have a roll call vote on the amendments I'm requesting a roll call vote on the amendments it's not required without objection there would be no roll call I'd like to ask the question of the author but we assign members Levine asking for a roll call vote on that we can go ahead and move well I'd also like to question the author about the amendments okay but on the point of the roll call did you want to are you silent on that then I'd like to ask a question so I would object to amending them before questions mr. Cooley has substituted for you and favors roll call so senator we will do a roll call vote thank you before you take this roll call because it is a very important point it's the whole reason we're here and that's why I wanted to respond if briefly before you roll call to Assemblyman Perea well certainly the motion would be debatable so we'll afford you thank you a moment to response I appreciate that so and thank you for your graciousness I'm afraid I think of you as one of the most rational members among the legislature I say that sincerely and complimentary you're thoughtful and you're rational and I want to have a rational conversation here you were not in the room so I'll show this to the committee a second time this is the website of the vapor they call themselves an innovative digital tobacco product the industry now mr. Connolly I have your name right yes okay mr. Connolly may argue back and he's an attorney I'm not so I should be very careful here that this is r.j. Reynolds and they've got a different agenda from the non Big Tobacco I'll get to that in a second but RJ Reynolds says we are a tobacco product they go on to say about their product they do not burn tobacco but rather heat liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco as you heard the doctor say you didn't hear the doctor spoke there's only one place from which nicotine comes it's tobacco federal definition of a tobacco product is any product that comes or derived from tobacco you don't have nicotine without tobacco it's derived from by federal definition it's a tobacco product so for those cigarette products that have tobacco have nicotine I don't know how a rational person can conclude it's not a tobacco product it is also by federal definition also by determination of the FDA and penny regulations now for those that may or may not have and we don't know because they're unregulated they claim they are they don't don't have to prove it to anybody but if there are in fact products for e-cigarettes that do not contain nicotine as I said earlier they have every opportunity to go to the FDA and say we're not nicotine test our products we're a cessation device we get people off of cigarettes they can do that they have not so the bill without that first amendment that you're about to all vote on makes complete sense it is counter-intuitive to vote aye on this first amendment to take out the words tobacco product and again there is reason why there are those who would like to take the words tobacco product out because then r.j. Reynolds and here's a story from Philip Morris to debut a cigarette with real tobacco they're taken the next step and they're also studies that have shown that as the industry continues to grow the content of the nicotine increases because it's addictive they've got you they'll get you more now again if you got a product without go to the FDA prove you don't have nicotine and become a cessation device and then I just want to read last last advertisement here this is from mark 10 again their website advertisement voluntarily mark 10 puts on its advertisement warning this product is not intended for use by women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or persons with or at risk of heart disease high blood pressure diabetes or taking medicine for depression or asthma nicotine is addictive and habit-forming and it is very toxic by inhalation they put this on their product voluntarily because they know the risks of it they know it is nicotine and they know it comes from tobacco so I would urge you to support the second and third and fourth amendments I appreciate the chair make good sense but to move forward with this is not a tobacco product is a very dangerous thing to do and should a majority of those voting today support all four amendments not only do I walk away from the bill the American Cancer Society walks away from the bill the American Heart Association walks away from the bill the lung association walks away from the bill the CMA it's away from the bill the narcotics Officers Association walks a bit and the police chief's all walk away we all walk away it is no longer our bill it cannot move forward with any of our blessings because it is a dangerous thing to do because all these folks say they've left cigarettes that's a good thing now I also have to say that no jobs will be lost the only difference between if if our bill is going to kill jobs and all those small vape shops through hey the chair wants to amend the bill and you're about to vote to do will do the same thing the only difference is whether it's a dip a co-product bless everyone's heart here who has left cigarettes that's a good thing for everybody I'm here today and all of our sponsors are here today to protect the children and if it's not defined as a tobacco product they'll still market to our children they'll still hook our children and that's why it's such an important difference so I thank you for your time I know you're gonna take your vote well I urge a no vote senator thank you for your comments that's the first invitation I've had in my short career to join you on the job killer list but I will certainly parts it just isn't true it isn't from any further debate on the motion I see I know mr. prey wanted to follow up and then mr. Cooley mr. Garcia mr. Linder so all right some discuss who's in my first prayer you're recognized thank you I'll be very brief because I know a lot of other members want to speak and I don't want to turn this you know into a debate other than to say that what concerns me and where I really struggle with the definition pieces to the gentleman here that testified that his product which doesn't contain nicotine would be caught up in the construct and framework of SB 140 and your response to that as well but there's an out they can go to the FDA they can get file this petition and I'm not familiar with this process but they can go do this I worry that and we put these folks who don't have nicotine in their product in a and it sounds like most of them are pretty small businesses small shops throughout the state I think I heard a couple people testify from Fresno I worried that if there's the shop owner it's him and two people three people four people you know do they have the resources do they have the time to not only go through the process of FDA but actually wait for the FDA and and I don't know how long it takes for the FDA to get back to them but if if the federal government is anything like the state government it takes a long time before these bureaucracies provide approvals for these types of products so I just worry that if we do the definition now that we have a whole group of individuals who will get caught up in this sort of political bureaucratic thing when they don't have to be so that's why I think that again it would be a mistake not to do something on this measure that's why I think the rest of the bill makes a lot of sense because we're moving the ball forward and still give us some time to figure out whether or not the definition how we play out that definition piece and I'm not saying I would be opposed to the definition maybe a year from now or well really just a year from now cuz I'm gone at the end of next year would be my last shot to weigh in but just having said that I just think we need more information because I just don't want I don't want there to be collateral damage for some folks similar in its definition P's all in my my piece just let me point out it's one under point out real briefly that none of these shops will be impacted with amendment one or without amendment one they won't be impacted at all they don't have to go to the FDA to become a cessation device this bill will not ban anything that they're doing and proof of it is at least a number of them said they were from San Jose from San Francisco San Diego guess what those cities already have that's which this bill proposes without the first amendment has law currently and they're in business and they're doing fine and they don't want us to do anything we're not doing anything proposing anything that is going to impact them they're already living with the local ordinance that does what I'm suggesting we do so that's a possible for children to access these devices so I would say that three of the four amendments I am satisfied that have been adopted and will be moving forward with this piece of legislation whoever decides to carry this forward but I do believe that there needs to be a bigger discussion and a conversation on amendment one as it relates to the definition much of what I've read regarding this industry these products more times than not what we have found is that many of these products do have nicotine much of what I have read also indicates that the FDA is moving in the direction of defining this product as a tobacco product there is federal legislation moving forward to try to grandfather these products prior to that regulation recommendations made by the FDA which tells me that there is a general sense that it is a tobacco product now what we heard today was that there are some products that do not have nicotine I think that makes a bigger conversation in terms of how we classify these products and devices to mr. Assemblymember peres point to blanket every single product as a tobacco product maybe challenged but I'd like to have that conversation I'd like to have that debate and I would hope that other members of this committee would as well because ultimately what we're trying to accomplish is a healthier California and the laws that have been instituted by the state to do so have proven to do exactly that as it relates to the tobacco laws that we have in place so I just wanted to make those statements I have a hard time putting my hands around the fact that we are not going to have the specific conversation about whether or not these products are a tobacco product or not and you know I don't know if there were any doctors here that testified I got here late to that point but it may be something that we want to look at moving forward so again thank you for bringing this bill forward thank you sir mr. Cooper I do want to thank the senator for bringing this bill forward I hadn't planned on speaking but mr. Cooley inspired me and it is really in my community and african-american community Hispanic community smoking and tobacco use is a big issue that the cancer rates the health care issues and you know we surpassed a toothless bill I mean I'm here I came here to to be a voice of people and I'm a I'll agree all the time with everybody but really it has no substance in the bill that was just passed and what my issue is nicotine is addictive with that so we all know that yes not if say it's not tobacco it's still nicotine and I'll tell you what you look around America and we have so many addictions we're an addictive society and having worked 10 years narcotics I'm not comparing this to drugs but people do have addictions and it's nicotine the bottom line they're still inhaling it and I say if you want a cessation I mean I really don't have a lot of faith in that to be honest that's just something that sounds good hey there's no nicotine in it and it appeals to kids I'm not gonna streets a lot I see a lot of kids using these there's an issue with it and for me to sit on my hands would be responsible and I really can't do that and I'm disappointed right now very disappointed and you know people can turn out and see all they want want and you guys are all adults you can make your decisions but kids don't have that decisions and they don't have the brains or intelligence to figure that out but it's something cool to using something cool to do now that's really what matters so that for you your business owners that's that's fine and adults but it comes down to our kids and we've seen a marked increase in kids using vape pants they do it in classrooms because there's no smell you can't see it teachers have their backs turned and they're doing that it's going on right now go talk to folks in the classroom they'll tell you this there's a big issue with that and it is nicotine is tip addictive it is a tobacco product it may not be tobacco that's the derivative so I mean some of these things I'm sitting up here and it's to me it's just disingenuous some of things that were said so like I said I hadn't plan on I'm talking but I can't see how I feel right now but it is it's really just it's just toothless up here past this and it's about our kids that's what it drills down to did a great job passing the smoking laws and getting it down and kids getting away from that this is just another tool so think about our kids but I'm just disappointed today mr. Hernandez Thank You mr. chair I just wanted to commend the author for bringing this bill forward I know that your intentions are altruistic I've had a chance to sit with both your team and with the opposition I believe that you've made the the best arguments with regards to the science and I know that you're trying to be helpful I I've been running the labor and employment committee now and understand that there's been some changes and amendments here that have completely altered the direction that you intend to go towards I'm not comfortable with those amendments and I'm going to be voting no for your request and so I just want to let you know that I don't agree with the way you were treated here today and I you have my support when this bill comes back thank you thank you mr. Shah Gina Jarren Thank You senator I just hate to see that this comes to an end to it is three out of four is not bad even though number one doesn't meet the satisfaction it's just to satisfy your efforts but instead of just putting an end to it and since we're gonna hear something from FDA it wouldn't be worked for you to bring it down the recursion tree concentration just as soon as FDA is as they're ruling on this I'm happy to take reconsideration from the committee should the bill well no my bill has already gone and dead so there's nothing to ask for consideration you're going to pass the bill as it is now and I oppose it as do all of my sponsors all the Health Organization I hear you but all the law enforcement organizations a function wouldn't you think it's at least it's a good step forward with three out of four no it's a dangerous step forward which is why not I just I but everybody else who supports the bill now opposes it any further debate or discussion on the issue seeing none do we have a motion or a second okay seeing none senator we'll hold that bill in committee all right thank you very much nice to meet you not on TV this time okay members let's please keep decorum in the committee room please exit quietly members were going to move to item six senator Wolk please approach and present Thank You mr. chair and members for 62 ads the Green Music Center on the Sonoma State campus to the list of facilities in existing law that are allowed to sell advertising space allows them to accept donated beer and wine and recognize those entities that make donations provided that a temporary license has been issued by ABC for 62 will enable the green music center to increase sponsorships increase fundraising to critical components of a successful performing arts venue the bill has received bipartisan support no opposition and I have some witnesses Andrew Martinez and Tim Lynch just testify in support of the bill and answer any questions I ask for your aye vote move the bill we have a motion in a second Angie Martinez California State University in support of the bill thank you Tim Lynch here not on behalf of any client but on a personal interest in the green music center and we support the bill as well wonderful any opposition seeing none do we have a motion in a second motion mr.

osYSbvh-2Js,03-15-2016,3390,CA,california if you have more than 50 employees your management is required to have training and in in harassment policies and our faculty should be setting not just barely meeting that standard but being a higher model at standard and so i appreciate that you've brought forward this bill and very pleased to be voting for it today thank you thank you any other questions or comments from members if not that's a good question based i i hope i heard correctly this is not just for management right this is for all employees right because management is including including maintenance workers whoever might come in contact with the students see something that's gone wrong and then would know how to report it okay because management has always had to do this you have to do it every year when i was at state so it sort of applies to others that's good that's correct thank you and there's an easy method they use now in the system because it's all online yeah so it shouldn't cost that much thank you thank you there was a motion by miss baker second by dr weber uh if the secretary to call the roll medina aye medina i baker baker i bloom bloom i chavez irwin jones sawyer joan sawyer i levine levine i linder low low i olson olson not voting santiago weber weber i williams williams i uh dr quirk uh your motion your bill uh passes will keep the roll open for members to add on thank you mr chair thank you our second item uh assemblymember mccarty ab-1594 thank you [Music] okay 1594 first correct okay thank you mr chair and members i'm pleased to present ab-1594 which would create a statewide policy for smoke-free campuses in california and prohibit persons for smoking or using tobacco products on our university campuses including the community colleges csu system and the uc system uh current smoking anti-smoking policies at csu and uc and community colleges are somewhat haphazard um we know that the research and the statistics show that uh smoking is certainly is dangerous to individuals leading cause of cancer heart disease and other serious ailments and second hand smoke can lead to strokes as well recognizing the serious health effects some campuses already do this as i mentioned earlier at the uc system they have such a policy at our csu they're starting there at our community colleges about one-fifth of the campuses have such a policy and this would create a uniform statewide standard and we think make our college campuses a safe and healthier place for higher learning i i appreciate some of the questions and suggestions raised in in the analysis and will really address those uh moving forward focusing on specific strategies for policy compliance as well as dealing with who specifically would administer the uh penalties and fines and so forth with me today are the american cancer society network and a nurse from sacramento city college thank you hi i'm tim gibbs with the american cancer society cancer action network and we support the bill i'd also like to note that my colleagues at the american heart association and american lung association have asked me to publicly state their organization's support as well smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in both men and women lung cancer kills over 13 000 californians every year and one out of three cancer deaths is due to tobacco the u.s surgeon general has declared that there's no risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke and even brief exposure to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse health effects in adults and children restricting tobacco use in college campuses is an important strategy in preventing young people from becoming lifelong smokers the american cancer society has 37 colleges against cancer chapters in california 14 of whom would be directly impacted by this bill those chapters have played a really important role in passing smoke-free policies on their campuses however there's no uniformity at csus or california community colleges and protections for our students should not vary based upon where you decide to go to school the california department of public health has identified the adoption of 100 tobacco-free policies at community colleges one of the top strategies for reducing health disparities in california and our community colleges are very diverse and compared to four-year institutions uh students have much more much higher tobacco use rates so with that we respectfully ask for your iphone thank you i'm wendy gomez i'm a college nurse for sacramento city college and we wholeheartedly support this bill sacramento city college became a designated smoking areas two years ago and will become smoke tobacco and vape free this fall for three main reasons and the three main reasons uh that we support this bill is that secondhand smoke is dangerous as he suggested it can exacerbate health conditions of other people such as asthma bronchitis copd and can even cause a heart attack according to the american lung association the second reason is that smoking is an unhealthy coping mechanism that leads to addiction college students are under a lot of stress and they're looking for a way to cope with that stress and part of our goal as a college is to teach them healthy coping strategies that is not one the goal the third reason is the goal of the community colleges it's to prepare individuals to go into the workforce or to go on to a four-year college and most likely those career choices or the four-year college is going to be a smoke-free environment so they're coming from a k-12 situation where there is not smoking allowed then we let them smoke at the community college level and then they go on to a four-year college and now they've got an addiction they've got to deal with because they can't smoke on that college or they're going to a career where they cannot smoke as well and so for those reasons and many other health reasons that are obvious we would support this bill witnesses and support good afternoon members betsy armstrong on behalf of the county health executives association representing california's local health departments in strong support good afternoon jp sheri you have one of my best nurses here with you today we support this bill for the los rios community college district hi my name is laurie jones i'm director of legislative affairs for the associated student body for american river college and i'm here today representing our tobacco smoke and vape free task force to urge and i vote and we are newly uh free of all of the above as of january 1st thank you good afternoon ashley wicklund on behalf of the american heart and american stroke association in support any witnesses in opposition not seeing any any questions or comments from members ms olsen thank you mr chair i don't have a problem with the subject matter of the bill per se but generally speaking i think we should be supportive of the independence of our higher education institutions they have boards that make decisions like these so every now and then there are overriding reasons that the state should get involved but can you explain to me why you think this is so important for the state legislature to interfere in what the normal process would be as opposed to allowing the community college system and the csu system to do this on their own sure i know we have independent elected boards at almost 100 community colleges but i think public health is paramount in a safe place to be healthy and and learn and the institution of higher education i think raises this issue for having a statewide policy and the csu board of trustees the csu board of trustees they don't have a position on this they're leaning towards us anyway they're about to do this and so i think if we didn't have the bill there's probably policy there the csu in the next number of months or years and uh um we've been working with them in consultation and i don't think that we have any concerns from that end thank you uh if i see no other comments or questions um entertain a motion bill moved by mr lowe second by mr levine uh madam secretary if you had called the bro medina aye medina i baker baker i bloom bloom i chavez irwin irwin i joan sawyer joan sawyer i levine levine i linder linderno low low i olson olsen no santiago weber weber i williams williams eye okay okay 9-2 your bill gets out i'll keep the roll open for uh absent members thank you thank you and we'll go now to uh somebody member mccarty's second bill okay uh item three a b 17 11. one second ready ready okay thank you mr chaired members i'm pleased to present my second bill ab-1711 which seeks to increase access for californians at our university of california system as you probably know it's been a growing trend for the uc system to enroll more out of state international students non-residents frankly at the expense of california students this started the last 5-10 years during the the budget crunch and frankly during those times i think it was appropriate uc system had to do anything to keep the lights on i think going forward as we've stabilized the uc system this sets a fair policy going forward to make sure we don't ration access to our higher education segment the university of california last year our budget process recognized this issue and increased funding for the uc for five thousand more california students in providing funding to do so in partnership with the uc however this past year we realized that uc actually admitted fewer first-time california residents at the uc system by sixteen hundred students at the same time increasing out-of-state uh residents by about forty seven hundred students and as you as you kind of see by the charts since 2007 over the last nine years actually california freshmen there are fewer californians in the uc system entering as a freshman 2015 2 decrease whereas non-resident students have have increased uh 335 so um the the notion that non-resident students helps increase access for california students the math just just doesn't add up and so we're setting forward a policy here that frankly isn't a new one as the agenda states in 2010 the regents even agendize setting a cap of a 10 policy for non-resident students now we're up at about 15 and a half percent uh system-wide as as you see
GT-dyIAYyiI,03-07-2016,3382,CA,"we have exempted places that sell tobacco so tobacco shops and other places private clubs things who would still may be able to allow smoking on premises but for bars and taverns hotels conference centers places like that where there there is much more public access they would be no longer exempted and under this bill there must be a large chunk because I can't imagine the smoke shops and folks represented anywhere near know I did my recollection was it was not quite that large true Brennan no no okay we'll find out thank you yeah we can get that information to you but my recollection was it wasn't quite that that many but just to clarify that statistic was a national number so that included other states and their smoke-free laws so this bill closes a little loopholes that it closes would bring the nation from forty eight percent to sixty nation in a nationwide for this for the state I don't have that specific number we get pretty we get pretty close the the exemptions you listed are still where you know I don't think that it's in the scheme of employ that's not will be relatively small it's not yeah it's not forty percent okay thank you Morlock Thank You mr. chair Assemblyman stone I just curious it says that an owner operated business even if it has no employees or no independent contractors just one person all by themselves they can't smoke that's correct can you still smoke in your home as you can so if your businesses in your home or is there an exclusion for that no and if you're if you are allowing people to come into your home if that's the place of your business then there is no exclusion for that so then if you're working on your own in your home that home business and no contact with the public then you can smoke I would presume so thank you any other questions comments seeing no questions or comments from any of the members would you like to close I ask for your aye vote and we have a motion by Senator

thank you mr. chair and members I'm here to present a b-29 it's a bill that will require that all of our campuses in the California state education system remain tobacco-free and that includes electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as our laws currently stand there are probably still 1,200 school districts that are not considered tobacco free that do not maintain signage just say tobacco cannot be anywhere on the campus including in vehicles and buildings throughout the campus this law would clarify that it is intended for all of our education agencies to promote tobacco-free policies and would also clarify the availability of funding for all of our school districts to be able to do that this bill has passed the assembly just last week and we would ask respectfully for the support of this committee today thank you is anyone like to speak in support of the measure wouldn't be freitas with the American Lung Association and California here in strong support it has been proven that schools that consistently enforce their tobacco-free policies have much lower smoking rates than schools that don't have policies like this and for these reasons we strongly support this bill and ask your aye vote Thank You anyone else in support Kali Hampton behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association support autumn Ogden on behalf of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also in strong support Christina Romero on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and strong support Michelle Gibbons with the county health executives Association

the California Medical Association in support Michelle Cabrera with SEIU California in support anyone like to make any comments or questions from any of the members see no questions or comments uh as Center Leno Thank You Assemblyman for authoring the bill and also specifically for including these cigarettes I'm sure your office not unlike mine have have heard from so many teachers parents others who say that they're just stunned how prevalent the smoking of e-cigarettes is in classrooms and that teachers often feel they have no legal right to stop their students from using these devices so it's very important that we make sure that this next generation is not as likely to become addicted to nicotine as they would otherwise so good work thank you sir move the bill we have a motion by Senator Leno would you like to close Thank You mr. chair Thank You senator Leno you know we we talked about this bill and clearly the one thing that we can do is prevent the kind of deaths that come from the use of tobacco and it's clear that when young people start smoking and that becomes the way they're introduced becoming a lifetime smokers and there's not a lot that we can control but we can control and prevent our kids from being exposed to these products that could shorten their lives and for those reasons I want to thank this committee and I urge your aye vote thank you thank you Cheers recommending support this is at number two do pass to appropriations a be nine special session number two call the members please Hernandez Hernandez aye Morrell Anderson Anderson no though Bell aye Hall Hall aye Leno aye Leno aye McGuire McGuire aye Mitchell Mitchell aye Monning Monning aye more Locke more like no Nielson Nielsen no pan pan I woke Wolk aye the count is nine to three that bill is out thank you item number three second extraordinary session a b10 bloom local taxes authorization cigarettes and tobacco products afternoon Assemblymember good afternoon Thank You mr. chair and members and thank you for giving me the opportunity to present ABX 210 which is a bill that allows counties to place local tobacco tobacco tax measures on the local ballot for a public vote California has one of the lowest tobacco taxes in the country we ranked 35th with an 87 cent tax per pack compared to the national average of a dollar 60 these rates have not been raised in California in over 15 years and yet smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States at least 30 percent of cancer deaths and 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking nationally 1 out of every 5 deaths is attributable to smoking in California 40,000 people lose their lives to tobacco related illness each year and tens of thousands of Californians struggle every day because of tobacco related illness of course treatment for these ailments as we all know is often expensive and medical spends 3.5 billion dollars in taxpayer dollars paying for tobacco related illnesses our goal is to reduce smoking and disease and we know that tobacco taxes work for every 10% increase in the pack of in the price of a pack of cigarettes there is a 4% reduction in overall cigarette consumption and a 6.5 percent reduction in youth consumption and this is only one of the reasons that why this bill is so important young people the Surgeon General projects that without a major reversal and trends 5.6 million youth aged 0 to 17 that are living today will die prematurely from tobacco use that's 5.6 million young people who will suffer premature preventable deaths today it is estimated that 16% of high school students are addicted not just smoking but addicted to cigarettes and one in four used some form of tobacco though there's widespread education on the dangers of tobacco availability and deceptive marketing continues to lure our youth to try these dangerous products tobacco kills more people than alcohol aids car accidents illegal drugs murders and suicides combined so members I ask you today to support this measure and take an important step towards fighting tobacco addiction and tobacco related illness ABX 210 will allow California counties to join the over 600 local jurisdictions nationwide that have their own cigarette tax or fees these jurisdictions bring in more than four hundred and thirty million dollars in annual revenue and work effectively to reduce smoking rates especially amongst young people and they decrease smoking caused death disease and of course the cost to go along with that increasing the cost of cigarettes is one of the most powerful and direct ways to reduce smoking studies have shown that youth and low-income adults are especially likely to quit or reduce smoking when prices increase our locals are well-equipped to know how to fight tobacco addiction this bill allows the Board of Supervisors of a county to propose such measures to their constituents it's a sensible measure that will help counties reduce tobacco use and save lives and I respectfully ask for your aye vote we have here today to add testimony Tim Gibbs with the American Cancer Society thank you and welcome thank you Tim Gibbs the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we support this legislation because we think local communities should be given a choice when it comes to protecting their citizens from the deadly effects of tobacco use as Assemblymember Liv mentioned there's more than 600 jurisdictions across the country that levy their own tobacco taxes and we want to give our 58 counties the ability to decide for themselves it's not a vote about raising tobacco taxes it's a vote about establishing local control and stopping tobacco companies from pre-empting counties when it comes to reducing smoking we hope that you agree that counties deserve to decide from themselves and we respectfully ask for your aye vote anyone else in support of the measure please step forward and state your name and position Lindsey Freitas American Lung Association California and strong support Kali Hampton behalf the American Heart and American Stroke Association in support Meghan all right on behalf the California Dental Association also in strong support Terry Brennan on behalf of Service Employees Union California in support Christina Romero on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and strong support Arunima law on behalf of next-gen climate action in support Tama with Health Access California in support Jody Hicks with California Academy of Family Physicians and the California Medical Association and support any opposition to the measure any questions come question your Center Anderson is there anything in the bill that prohibits the money that's been taxed by the counties to be used for roads or or galas or anything other than for the purpose of reducing smoking depends on the use of the money depends on how the individual county determines it could be money that goes into a general fund in which case it would be distributed according to the budgetary prerogatives of the local jurisdiction or it could be specified how it's used thank you any other

Nazarian cigarette tobacco product licensing fees and funding good afternoon please welcome and please present mr. chair senators AV 11 updates the cigarette and tobacco products licensing program by updating the licensing fee imposed on retail locations distributors and wholesalers the bill basically establishes annual fees as two hundred and sixty-five dollars for retail locations and $1,200 for distributors and wholesalers since 2003 BOE has administered the licensing program which levies licensing fees on businesses that sell and distribute tobacco products in the state since the launch of the program though the fee has not changed it has remained as a one-time fee of only $100 per retail location so all the work that our enforcement agents need to do it goes off of that single hundred dollars per new location that opens up annually in 2003 to 2004 the licensing fee generated 18 million which at the time was sufficient to maintain the program however over time the cost to run the program has exceeded the revenue generated from the fee Board of Equalization estimated for estimates for fiscal year 1314 the program cost nine point six million and only generated 1.8 million from licensees as boe requires payments from first five tobacco education prevention programs the breast cancer Research Fund and a general fund which receives cigarette and tobacco excise tax proceeds to cover the administration cost of the licensing program it is evident that the lifetime retailer fee is no is not adequate to maintain a viable enforcement program the additional revenue generated due to this bill will eliminate the need to divert tobacco excise taxes from their intended purposes a b11 is also good for businesses as it helps to stop violators from circumventing the law and competing with legitimate establishments who need the enforcement arm of the state to help protect their their business with that I want to introduce into individuals in support of this bill autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society action I'm sorry American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and Monique Ramos with first five California thank you good afternoon chair and members autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in strong support of assembly bill 11 this bill is important because it will preserve critical programs by ensuring there's adequate funding revising the cigarette and tobacco products licensing Act to increase licensing fees the Board of Equalization will be able to cover the cost of the program without having to take funding from other critical programs that are already suffering this bill is here today just because we've changed the date and we strongly encourage you to vote aye thank you thank you Monique Ramos on behalf of first 5la as well as first five California in strong support of baby 2x11 consist this measure is consistent with the state audit with an audit that was released last week by the state auditor and it

RVif3eQ4dm8,03-08-2016,3383,CA,thank you do we have any additional authors I can go old school and just to shut down the committee like we used to do with mcdhh in it's very tempting back in the dank thank you for coming members this is a bx2 ten assembly bloom floors ABX 210 which is a bill that allows counties to place local tobacco tax measures on the ballot for a public vote there are currently over 600 jurisdictions outside of the state of California that have the ability to raise their own tobacco taxes in addition to the obvious health impacts for making cigarettes more expensive there is a financial benefit those 600 jurisdictions bring in over four hundred and thirty million dollars in revenue each year while reducing the smoking rate especially amongst youth there is no cost to the state and he costs incurred by the state for the startup and administration of a local tax program must be reimbursed by the counties that are enacting the tax therefore I respectfully ask for your aye vote Thank You mr. witnesses in support the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and you know we always believe that local governments should have the most impactful policy tools when it comes to improving health and reducing smoking should counties choose to increase their tobacco tax the financial benefit would be significant they would have the ability to reduce smoking and thus reduce healthcare costs while raising revenue to be spent however the Board of Supervisors and voters decide so we believe that our 58 counties deserve the option to decide for themselves whether or not raising the tobacco tax makes sense so we respectfully ask for your aye vote get additional witnesses in support Lindsay Freitas American Lung Association in California and support kula Koenig American Heart Association American Stroke Association in support Meghan Allred California Dental Association in support Alysia Sanchez with the California Medical Association in support Michelle Cabrera with SEIU California in support Erin Gabel on behalf of first five California in support Jody Hicks with the California Academy of Family Physicians in support Gregory Kramer with Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and support Anthony right with Health Access California and support thank you when this is an opposition finance we do not have a position on this bill if locals are authorized to levy additional tobacco taxes tobacco consumption is expected to decrease because of cost pressure this will drive an unquantifiable decrease in general fund and special fund state tobacco tax revenues in addition additional cost to the Board of Equalization are expected in terms of the need to redesign its current IT system which is based on uniform statewide tax rate while these costs will ultimately be recovered through local and reimbursements the initial startup costs may need to be funded with in BO ease existing resources or through an additional general fund appropriation thank you comments or questions from committee it's a motion by some senator hill secretary please call the roll motion is do pass to the Senate floor Lara aye Lara aye Bates no Bates no bail DeLeon Hill Hill aye Mendoza Mendoza aye Nielsen Thank You mr. broom we're gonna hold that roll been allow absent members to vote thank you thank you very much waiting for mr.

distributors and wholesalers the bill establishes an annual fee as $265 per retail location and $1200 upon distributors and wholesalers since 2003 the Board of Equalization has administered the licensing program which levies licensing fees on businesses that sell and distribute tobacco products in the state since the launch of the program the fee has not changed it has remained as a one-time fee just a one-time fee per retail location and these fees go towards not only the first five la programs but as well as the enforcement that we help pay for the officers to ensure that these products are not sold to underaged minors in 2003 to 2004 the licensing fee generated 18 million which at the time was sufficient to maintain the program however over time the cost to run the program has exceeded the revenue generated from the fee Board of Equalization estimated for fiscal year 2013 to 14 the program cost nine point six million and only generated 1.8 million for licensees from licensees as a result the board requires payments from first five tobacco education prevention programs the Breast Cancer Research Fund and general fund which receive cigarette and tobacco excise tax proceeds to cover the administration cost of the licensing program it is evident that the lifetime retailer fee is not adequate to maintain a viable enforcement program the additional revenues generated due to this bill will eliminate the need to divert tobacco excise taxes from their intended purposes a b11 is also good for businesses as it helps to stop violators from circumventing the law competing with legitimate businesses so with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote and I'm joined with by autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society action that were witnesses in support autumn Ogden with American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in proud support of this bill currently the BOE diverts the excise tax revenue from critical programs such as the Breast Cancer Fund the tobacco control program and the general fund along with first five California to cover the cost of licensing tobacco by revising the cigarette and tobacco products licensing act to increase licensing fees the BOE will be able to cover the cost of the program without having to take funding from important programs that are already suffering as for your vote Thank You additional witnesses in support

program to become self-sufficient replacing the current $100 one-time fee with an annual fee of $265 is estimated to an additional nine point five million dollars annually Thank You comments or questions from committee senator Nielson afternoon Assemblyman Zellman Nazarian this is not a facetious question it's a very sincerely asked question if marijuana is legalized in California is it contemplated that that it will also be licensed the marijuana as it will be taught tobacco too will be legislation to include it under taxation and under licensing III this bill does not cover that no no I know it and you wouldn't because that would be prospective you don't know if it is or not sure it were it to be is it contemplated and considered that it would make logical sense there is of course uh but I think that would require a whole other conversation given that we've already been through certain conversations and as legislation that was carried last year did not necessarily put marijuana use and enforcement under the purview of ABC this is under the purview of ABC enforcement so I think that would probably require us to have a future conversation on figuring out where exactly and and on that note I'll just use the privilege of saying you know if this is to go forward I hope that our input as legislators legislative body and state government is heard and there's enough of a tax put into place to ensure that there's adequate and appropriate enforcement of future of marijuana legalization thank you thank you additional comments or questions from committee

eDNsfsn9FOs,08-25-2015,3185,CA,"smoking behavior and make something that children have never seen before appear cool and that is engaging in smoking behavior in public places like restaurants and other public places despite what opponents claim these cigarettes are tobacco products the nicotine and e-cigarettes is derived from the tobacco plant without tobacco there would be no electronic nicotine delivery vices the vast majority these projects do not do indeed have nicotine the reason they exist in the first place is to maintain nicotine addiction for the few products that have do not have nicotine and makes sense to regulate them as tobacco products because it's impossible for code enforcement and law enforcement officials to tell which product contain nicotine and which do not the use of e-cigarettes is still an act that stimulates smoking and the best way for enforcement officials to deal with them is to treat them like a tobacco product this bill is sponsored by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network American Heart Association American Lung Association California narcotic Officers Association in the California college and university police chief Association I respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you something member Cooper and you have some witnesses with you today mr. chair members of the committee my name is John Lovell and I represent two of the co-sponsors of the bill the California college and university police chiefs Association the California and narcotic Officers Association I'm also here on behalf of the California police chiefs Association and I received word this morning that the California Association of code enforcement officers has also come on in support of the bill this bill is fundamentally about children the growth of e-cigarettes among children has been nothing short of alarming mr. Cooper's bill will bring East cigarettes under the rubric of the stake Act which is a proven strategy for keeping tobacco products out of the hands of children it will also define these products for what they are tobacco products we are very proud to co-sponsor this bill and we commend mr. Cooper for bringing this forward Thank You mr. Lovell good afternoon mr. chair and members I'm Tim Gibbs with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we're also proud co-sponsors of this bill because as assembly member Cooper mentioned this bill is about preventing an entire new generation of nicotine addicts you know it's critical for this bill that we define e cigarettes as a tobacco product the nicotine in e-cigarettes is derived from the tobacco plant you know other than a weak age verification law we have no other regulations on e-cigarettes in California the tobacco companies have been relentless in preventing these products from being regulated now we're at the cusp of meaningful regulation of e-cigarettes in California unfortunately a opponents on the Spill insists that any regulation take place under the faulty premise that e-cigarettes are not tobacco products the tobacco companies have been waging a battle all across this country to drive a wedge between how we regulate e-cigarettes and how we regulate combustible tobacco products for the most part students know that tobacco is dangerous the tobacco companies want to maintain the fiction that e-cigarettes are safe it's an abhorrent business strategy when those companies depend on hooking millions of young people on nicotine through e-cigarettes to eventually sell more combustible cigarettes you know the consensus is clear each cigarettes or tobacco products internationally you have the World Health Organization recommends that e-cigarettes be treated as a tobacco product at the national level you have the CDC and FDA FDA have recommended that e-cigarettes be treated as a tobacco product at the state level you have the California Department of Public Health report from the State Health Officer on the dangers of e-cigarettes that recommends that e-cigarettes be regulated as a tobacco product on the local level you have a hundred seventy eight cities and counties that regulate e-cigarettes as a tobacco product more than forty percent of this population are 40 percent of our population in California is covered by laws that essentially do the same thing as this bill and we have our largest cities like Los Angeles San Diego San Francisco who all have what is essentially this bill protecting their citizens so to protect children from becoming addicted to nicotine to protect workers from inhaling secondhand each cigarette aerosol air assault and to improve the health of all Californians we ask for your aye vote thank you seeing a quorum president Madam Secretary please call the roll Bonta here mainshine Baker Bonilla Campos Eduardo Garcia Levine Mayes Santiago steinorth stone Thurmond wood we have a quorum Thank You additional witnesses in support please state only your name organization or city and position on the measure video born representing American Academy of pediatric California division in support start with Kaiser Permanente and strong support has been Gordon with the California block Health Network and strong support Breanna Pittman with the California Dental Association and strong support at least his Sanchez representing the California Medical Association in support Whitney Stanford on behalf of first five California in the first five Association in strong support thank you Deputy Attorney General Matt Campbell on behalf of Attorney General Kamala Harris in support Jerry Jeffy representing the California chronic care Coalition in support David Ford for the Association of Northern California oncologists in the medical oncology Association of Southern California in support Kimberly Chen with the California pan-ethnic Health Network in strong support that's the arm spring with the county health executives association and strong support Tim Ryan representing the California Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians and the California Chapter of the American College of Cardiology in sport so I assume on behalf of Health Access California and supports chair and members Sean south on behalf of the California Primary Care Association in support Lindsay Freitas American Lung Association in California proud co-sponsor in strong support Terry Brown on behalf of Service Employees International Union proud member of saved lives California Coalition strong support Kali Hampton behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association proud co-sponsor Vanessa here on behalf of California Society of Anesthesiologists and support Michael Ratigan on behalf of the Board of Supervisors Santa Clara County in support amber came with the association of California healthcare districts in support Justin Garrett with the March of Dimes in support dr.

in support thank you seeing no additional witnesses in support I want to thank you for stating your position so clearly and efficiently will now go to witnesses in opposition to testify please come forward to the table as indicated earlier there's three minutes each please proceed whenever you're ready good afternoon chairman and members my name is Carrie Hess and I'm here today to ask you to oppose this bill in three capacities first as a former smoker of 21 years second as co-owner of North Cal vape in Redding and third as a registered addiction specialist with almost ten years of experience who believes that vapor products are the best and most successful tool for harm reduction in nicotine management ever invented please note that I am not affiliated with big tobacco in any way and I'm here in a voluntary capacity the vapor industry supports common-sense regulations to strengthen California's existing ban on sales to minors as well as child resistant packaging however we cannot support this bill because it falsely Divine's tobacco free products as tobacco so I have to ask why is it so important to Devine to define vapor products as tobacco you may have heard that it is because they contain nicotine and that nicotine can only come from the tobacco plant this is incorrect in addition to the tobacco plant nicotine is naturally found in many vegetables including eggplants potatoes - potatoes tomatoes and more you have also heard the argument that including e-cigarettes in the statutory definition of tobacco is necessary to protect the children this is also incorrect every pivot provision in this measure to protect children can be advanced using the current definition of e-cigarettes many vapor products do not contain nicotine at all the sponsor of this bill has repeatedly claimed that e-cigarettes are not nicotine free this is simply untrue manufacturers in California have invested millions into equipment and procedures dedicated to manufacturing non nicotine products and moreover those vapor products which do contain nicotine are clearly labeled as such it does not make any sense to categorize a non nicotine product as a tobacco product the argument that we are marketing to minors is offensive and inaccurate vapor products are created by adults for adults several studies have shown that flavors are an integral part of the vaping experience as they help adults to break their taste - deadly tobacco - radio reiterate our sole overriding issue with this bill is that it defines vapor products as tobacco we support the bills provision related to minors and in fact all of the policy goals contained in this bill can be achieved by using the existing statutory definition for e-cigarettes we cannot emphasize enough that we wholeheartedly share the goal of protection for minors but we cannot support our product being lumped into the same statutory definition as combustible cigarettes mr. chair members I would ask each of you to consider if you want your legacy to be the continued propagation in prolonging of the tobacco epidemic if the author of this bill were proposing appropriate regulation specifically for vapor products we might support it however the legislation being proposed today unfortunately persists in using inaccurate and illogical definition for e-cigarettes as tobacco products and for this reason we must strongly oppose this measure Thank You next witness good afternoon chair and distinguished members of the committee my name is gregory connelly and i am here today on behalf of a nonprofit called the american vaping association which advocates for responsible in science-based policy towards vapor products otherwise known as electronic cigarettes earlier this month I proudly celebrated five years as a non smoker thanks to vapor products the August 2010 was my quit date and I'm here today to urge you to oppose this bill not just because it falsely redefines tobacco product to include often nicotine free products and tobacco free products but also because you are falsely redefining California's definition of smoking to include the use of a smoke free product as my colleague is noted the vapor industry is not opposed to common-sense reasonable regulation we would love to see sting operations happening today in vape shops across California to ensure that sales are not being made to minors however this bill goes about in a completely backwards and illogical way the idea that we must define these tobacco free smoke free and often nicotine free products as tobacco simply does not make sense do you do you see whether or not the California Legislature has decided that something is tobacco what evidence do they have that this classification would actually reduce usage in any way different than if we simply created these stop vapor products sales to youth act it would not have as friendly of an acronym mistake but it would be an effective bill that would protect youth as somebody who considers himself to be not only a public health advocate but also an anti-smoking advocate it has continually surprised me over the past five six years that so-called anti-smoking groups groups that dedicated supposedly their lives to ending the smoking epidemic have been the loudest most vociferous voices against these smoke-free products especially now in the light of last week's released by public health England a very respected watchdog a report finding these smoke-free tobacco-free products to be at least 95 percent less hazardous and smoking that they pose no known risk to bystanders and that there's no evidence of a Gateway effect the study referenced earlier does not actually show any sort of Gateway effect it is like saying that teens who experiment with red wine versus teens who never experiment with red wine which of those teens do you expect will go on to drink vodka in the future which of them will be more likely that is what they were saying with this study they found that teens had experimented with vapor products one year later the teens who had experimented with vapor products more likely to have reported smoking just one cigarette so there's no gateway effect being shown smoking over the past three four years a record dramatic decline of forty percent never before seen so this idea that this is creating a new generation of smokers and this is leading to smoking is simply false thank you very much thank you very much additional witnesses in opposition my name is Mario weeks I represent the vapor spot and we vehement ly oppose

committee Assemblymember Baker yes please Thank You mr. chairman mr. Cooper can you please address the question regarding the definition of tobacco and I just address one of the main points that was raised and I could benefit from that I think it's very interesting that our speaker over here spoke about vegetable or plant products being used I've never heard of that and well they some of those vegetables may contain contain nicotine nicotine primarily comes from tobacco that is what is used and it's funny that 95 season counties in California already have some type of e-cigarette regulation in many of the counties and cities these folks live in and come from already regulated so it so it is a tobacco product nicotine is the addictive portion of it bottom line no if ands or buts about it I spent 30 years as a police officer and 10 years working narcotics nicotine is addictive that's those laws were passed in with tobacco sure it's been extracted from the tobacco plant but it's still highly addictive with it and it's just it's just disingenuous and these folks say that it is it and one thing I do support a cessation it's a great job it says smoking cigarettes it's much better but the fact is it still contains nicotine and that's the bottom line just a little bit farther please yeah and you mentioned the the counties throughout California that already do this does your bill in any way affect the ability of local jurisdictions to choose their own path in this regard let's say if they want to have something more strict or it would allow for that okay and the final one is what are other states doing in this regard of you you've probably had an opportunity to sample that can you there quite a few states that regulated it's just really all over the board and right now it's the Wild West the FDA does not regulate it some folks spoke about some of these cigarettes that supposedly don't contain nicotine well the FDA has done some tests and actually found nicotine and some of those devices so really it's unregulated everything we pretty much we eat and drink is regulated by the FDA there's some law addressing that with this there is no law so it's up to that individual manufacturer and while the most of them I'm sure are good businessman yeah some that that aren't well I guess what I was getting more to is have you seen and there may not be any Studies on this if a similar statute has had the effect of helping or hurting cessation well the bottom line I guess it comes down to if this passes today this bill goes through and passes what does it do these folks can still buy their vape cigarettes nothing changes this puts in legislation where it defines it as a tobacco product so I mean to me in my mind it doesn't really change anything they can still buy it they can still sell it so maybe there isn't it may be that there's no study out there that has looked at what the experience the effect that these laws have had on on the use of smoked tobacco that's really what I was curious about if in preparing this bill if you've looked at that and I'll I'll tell you I'm leaning towards supporting your bill so I'm not trying to say you don't know it's more along the lines if I but I am curious if you've seen from other states that may have had any regulation of e-cigarettes similar to what you're proposing if it has had an effect positive or negative on cessation sure there have been other states that have passed legislation that's that's fairly similar to this you know we know in California with 178 cities and counties that have passed a cigarette no regulations that do treaty cigarettes like a tobacco product it has had in effect in terms of you know the the sort of renormalization of smoking behavior you know having children watch grown-ups smoke you know use e-cigarettes in restaurants in you know public places where people gather is has a detrimental effect to your specific question on whether or not there are studies that have shown and and an ordinance or a state law that passed that that treats cigarettes specifically as a tobacco product you know I can only tell you what we know in California and that those cities and county instead of past this you know we are seeing the the sort of explosion of e-cigarette usage you know all over the state and you know it's it's definitely time to act in California and the the those cities have certainly seen a you know a that the explosion is tempered shall we say any other questions or comments from members dr. wood yeah this is my question a couple questions for the people opposing the bill there I believe it was you sir that said that there really hadn't been a dramatic increase in the use of these products by young people there absolutely has been an increase in experimentation of vapor products I mean you said it was they try like one cigarette and then they'd be done what I was saying was that there were two points I made regarding youth smoking which was there's been a rapid dramatic record decline of 40% in teen smoking and two federal surveys between 2011 and 2014 and also that the study that was brought up that was published in JAMA last week that is being used to say there is a gateway effect from true vapor products to traditional cigarettes the authors of that study have come out and said that that's not a proper conclusion to draw because all they did was see okay of course somebody who's willing to try a vapor product is the kind of person that's going to be willing to try a cigarette and they'll be more willing to try a cigarette then somebody who won't even try a vapor product a couple other follow-up questions do the chair you said there are lots of other chemicals in these vapors there are and I'm and I think it would be hard to deny that when you when you when someone execs exhales this you see this this vapor there are other chemicals I'm not aware of studies that have been done to say whether they're harmful or not but I I believe one of you said the vapor is essentially harmless but then you I believe said that it's 95 percent less hazardous which implies that there still is a hazard direct that was the two authors of the public health England report essentially giving a worst-case scenario for the future and that is worst case scenario for the user and what we do know is that inhalable medications like the Nicorette inhaler that's made by Pfizer or GSK there are international standards for what levels of different chemicals are allowed to be present in the vapor in the mist that comes off of inhalable medicines and the levels for the actual user even assuming that the user is taking 600 puffs a day which no one in this room actually does the levels are below for the user what is allowed to be contained in inhalable medicine so then you're talking about bystanders where it is a Manute amount that the you that the user is actually exposed to versus the bystander so absolutely there are chemicals but there are chemicals in everything I was in Starbucks this morning California perhaps more than any other state has done more to miss educated citizens through proposition 65 because in Starbucks they were warning me about carcinogens in the car-rental place they were warning me about carcinogens no one in this state as far as I know actually pays attention to those signs anymore because they recognize yeah everything has chemicals it's the levels that matter not the mere presence and what one final question and thank you for your thank you for your interesting it sounded like rain I believe I'm under stood that you your prompt one of your primary it could be comfortable for both of you your primary objection to this bill is that that this defines ecig res as tobacco products is that fair to say so I come from a city where I was when I was the mayor last year we actually passed legislation in the city of Healdsburg that did not define - about the e-cigarettes as tobacco products but we defined them what we did was we we we by statute by legislation created a situation where they were treated like tobacco products exactly through the same mechanism that we do for other other things so I'm curious would you object to that because if you're if you're if your assertion is that is the definition that bothers you I wonder I'd love to hear what you have to say about that of course if this bill was amended to make vapor products non tobacco products to put them in their own category it would be better but there is a vast difference between the kinds of regulations that local governments enact so I guess the answer is no the answer is the bill would be a heck of a lot better but we'd still like to work out some kinks okay thank you thank you additional questions or comments from members mr. chair yes mr. Garcia I I know that it's been alluded several times this public health study done by the United Kingdom and from what I've read in the executive so I might be lying to your fight said I've read the entire study it does two things I think it says one that the use of vaping e-cigarettes are less harmful than your traditional cigarette and then it also in my opinion does not highlight a couple of things that I think are extremely important and that's the data that would say here are the long-term impacts of vaping are utilizing these devices and to me where I get stuck here is where it does not give it a clean bill of health saying that it is not harmless what I think of when I get to that point is that it is said that 500,000 people I'm gonna estimate give or take die from smoking cigarettes in the United States so the number of 95 percent less harmful if I'm looking at it from the standpoint of people's public health and fatality rates that would mean that only you know 25 26 thousand people would die by using this type of device according to the study that the United Kingdom has put forward that it is 95 percent less harmful so I get caught there where we have a situation where we take a zero risk position or we lower the level of the threshold if I may for lack of term in terms of the harm that it could cause if consumed and so that's one can you kind of address some of your comments sort of points the vast vast majority of users of these products are either smokers people inhaling burning smoke into their lungs on a daily basis or they are ex smokers who have switched and I believe that if you had the two distinguished authors here before you today they would not say that 25,000 people of the 500,000 per year that they would actually die from vapor product usage they are using that as the worst case scenario the best number that would be easily understood by the general public the general public tends to think in zeroes and fives if they say 97 98 it's a little more confusing than just saying 95 I think that that would translate into there have been Studies on other products a month off of someone's life versus if you average a huge poll of people that have used the product a month off their life perhaps versus smoking where you have six seven years of one-third of the people who smoke plus many more so you know the United Kingdom I which I think and please correct me if I'm wrong is a member of the European Union I may be a all right correct in the European Union many of the countries there have adopted far more stricter regulations and I'm sorry and and you know labeling as it relates to what these products contain the limited amount of actual nicotine in these products and of course the the type of marketing that is done my assumption is you're probably not in favor of though those types of regulations we would be perfectly happy to have the FDA step down with reasonable regulations on labeling on good manufacturing practices etc we are grateful gravely concerned about individual states doing this because then you end up with 50 different regulations on labeling 50 different regulations on what can be in the liquid and that's disastrous for small businesses especially those here today that don't have the resources of a large tobacco company behind them and I'll add that in those European countries that have taken stiff positions in the Asian countries that have pretty much banned at the advice of groups like those supporting these bills smoking is not declining in the way that it is declining in countries like the UK where you have stop smoking clinics actually offering support to e-cigarette users I can't imagine in the United States actually seeing cancer heart or lung say one positive thing about vapor products let alone have their stop smoking support services actually lend support to people looking to quit smoking thank you I wanted just to just comment that you know I've had the opportunity to speak to a number of local business owners who are concerned about the added cost to the business and you know one of the conversations that I had was I mean I'm not sure what type of price tag you put on public health in the lives of individuals some remember Cooper alluded to the industry by no means I believe the intention of this bill is to eradicate the the business aspect of e cigarettes and vaping people we'll still have the ability to purchase these just simply under a different criteria an umbrella in order for the purposes of regulation and so I you know I I've not heard anyone a lot of the comments and conversations have been I won't be able to stay in business because of this policy and shifting it over under the tobacco legal coats can you kind of I think the point of this bill is that it continues the campaign that the California Department of Public Health started back in January where they started running commercials misleading smokers and misleading adults into believing that vaping may be as hazardous of smoking that is the goal of these groups is to make adults believe that the jury is still out on whether vaping is any different from any other tobacco product I think that's morally wrong I think it's scientifically wrong and that is their goal that has been their goal since 2009 when they tried to get the FDA to ban these things to adults but that would be in line with the public health report from the United Kingdom right I think the jury is still out and tertiary public health implications right my apologies for interrupting the jury is still out on exactly whether it's ninety five percent ninety seven ninety eight ninety four percent there is no doubt and even some of the most virulent Lee Anne Tuohy vaping researchers at the University of California San Francisco even freely admit if you prod them a little bit but yes obviously using a vapor product is far less hazardous than smoking let me just close by saying that I certainly support those individuals who are here and who have you know shared in the past and in the more recent conversations that this has changed their life that this has improved their health that their marriages have improved and and that they've become better role models for their children but it doesn't change my outlook from the standpoint that there is still some harmful contaminant in these products that is really at the core of the conversation today so I just wanted to close with those comments thank you other comments or questions from members some of the member Thurmond a mr. chair I want to thank the author for bringing this bill I want to thank those who testified and supporting against and for all those who've come here to speak because this is not an issue that is clear very very much so you know I'm no expert on and I got a lot of questions and I appreciate it hearing all the perspectives and from all the I think the entire industry was here today so you know thank you for sharing look I'm happy for all the folks who said that this has helped that e-cigarettes has helped them to stop smoking I do have some critical questions though because I think that this is a serious issue and is impacting young people in a serious way and I really like the nexus that the author of this bill is making between potential harm for children as it relates to e-cigarettes and so I'm going to ask some questions particularly to the opposition about things that I have read and heard that seem factual and and I think we should discuss first one is isn't it a fact that e-cigarettes contain nicotine and if that is true shouldn't we be passing this bill and doing everything that we can to keep to keep nicotine I'm sorry nicotine out of children's hands we should be doing things to keep nicotine out of children's hands that can be done without defining these products as tobacco and also unlike the FDA the FDA has stated that if a product a component or a part of a vapor product does not contain nicotine they will not be regulating it as a tobacco product that's in there deeming regulation that came out last April but this bill would make even non nicotine products devices just batteries that people sell they would become tobacco products but under the FDA's rules they would not be that's a good argument but my guess is that no one's gonna buy the vaping device without buying what goes with it that's incorrect why why would somebody here could tell you better than me but there are many vapors who step down off of nicotine there are people who want to quit and they want to get off nicotine immediately my colleague would like to have happy to hear thank you so as a business owner with a retail vape shop approximately 10 to 15 percent of all the e-liquid that we sell contains no nicotine and we've seen a dramatic trend in the two years that we've been in business to where people have made a ship lower lower lower in nicotine and now they like to having a huge component of help how electronic cigarettes help people quit is because it mimics the hand-to-mouth motion the habit of it and so even when people are have wean themselves down they still like to continue participating in the habit however they are celebrating not not using non nicotine products so it doesn't make sense at all to me to classify a non nicotine product as a tobacco product under this bill let's continue that line of thinking and I that's very helpful to know but as I've been reading some studies about when young people use e-cigarettes mostly many have said that they've never tried traditional cigarettes before and so in the case of young people they wouldn't be buying the the vaping devices to step down if they have never smoked a cigarette before what we're finding is that yes there are large large swathes of youth that have tried vapor products that have never smoked but when you actually start to boil it down look at past 30 day usage and then go further the 2015 California healthy youth survey as well as other surveys that are being done across this country now are actually looking at times of the month days of the month that someone has used the vapor product and when you get down to where there's actual habitual use over ten days a month 95% plus 90 percent plus 98% plus in some states are either smokers or X smokers so there is a vast difference in the literature about nicotine gum patch lozenge other smoke free nicotine products where they've given them to people with Alzheimer's with people with other diseases that may have some benefit to nicotine they don't develop a dependence there's a vast difference between inhaling burning smoke literally freebasing nicotine and a vapor product or any other smoke-free nicotine product and if I may the studies actually don't differentiate whether these children are using products that contain nicotine or no nicotine so theoretically every single teenager who's been in this study has vaped a product with no nicotine so the study isn't well rounded or accurate because it doesn't even differentiate whether nicotine is used by the youth different question but I'm gonna follow on the train that you were just going about please we talked about lung capacity absolutely I just read just now as we're having this conversation a study that says ten minutes of smoking e-cigarettes causes noticeable change in airway resistance in the lungs and so again I'm gonna always come at you from the standpoint of I think this is good for young people and if we know that when things are exposed to young people that could put them in further harm's way down the line I would say as in this case why not pass this legislation if we know that vaping creates resistance airway resistance in the lungs particularly for young people I'm putting the lens of young people on it sir with all due respect dr. Michael Siegel who's a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health one of the original anti-smoking advocates who's testified against the tobacco industry never taken a dime from them he commented on that very study that I believe you are referencing and referenced another study finding that when people sit in a sauna for 10 minutes that cause is about the same level of airway resistance that does not indicate any kind of harm short-term irritation does not indicate any kind of harm and there's a great paper that I really encourage you to read regardless of how you vote today lung harm reversal pilosa pol osa or an Italian researcher collected the evidence on studies that have asked followed vapors throughout months or years to look at their lung capacity to survey them about their lung capacity and you have smokers people who smoked for 40 years people some of these people here today probably used to have an oxygen machine or used to walk with a cane but because they get the same of quitting smoking the lung capacity returning even though they are vaping that is that is what is happening in the real world not in a clinical study that just looks at what happens after 10 minutes thank you sir yeah right yet for the questions anymore okay we're gonna go some of member Thurmond has his questions that he's wrapping up and then miss Baker had one but doesn't and we can entertain a motion now I'd like to move the bill we have a motion we have a second thank you mr. Thurmond continue thank you then we'll move on I I didn't read that study but I'm happy to read it when you meet me at the sauna we'll read it together about that the last one really is about the flavors of vapor and I have a hard time accepting that these are not products being catered to young people when there are flavors such as gummy bear or other flavors that appear to be geared toward young people and it just seems to me that if we want to protect young people we would do everything in our power to do so including say that we pass this bill so that young people aren't getting access to these products well I would just add before going into flavors you can get the same effect as this bill the sting operations retail licensing without defining them as tobacco products on flavors five years ago August 10 2010 I quit smoking with a watermelon flavored vapor product and since then everything that I've used has been a flavor that opponents will describe as child-friendly or intentionally marketed to attract children today I have mango if you asked this room if you are using something other than tobacco or menthol are you using gummy bear or a gum or anything of that sort that they want to falsely paint which has been something going on for six years we have a great study a survey of 4500 adult vapors finding that 70% plus their main flavor was either fruit or something sweet and that they rated flavor availability sorry as extremely important in staying smoke-free and so flavors are incredibly important and I would urge you to talk just the vapors in your community the people that have quit smoking and asked them what they're using and I think many of you would be surprised we don't agree but I appreciate your discussion on the facts thank you sir thank you thank you we have a motion we have a second assembly member Cooper would you like to close please sir please first of all I want to thank all our speakers for coming out here today I truly appreciate it and it is a cessation device the folks that got off tobacco products I applaud you it's tough nicotine is addictive it's hard to get off of so I think it's a good thing you're off of this this is really about our children and author to my speaker to my left set it large swaths of you try cigarettes and that's the bottom line and you could say tobacco whatever is still the product in tobacco is nicotine that is very addictive and we want to make sure our kids have a chance to grow up and not experience this it is an issue right now you go out in the streets you see a lot of e-cigarettes a lot of kids smoking these cigarettes a lot of your operations for alcohol and cigarette buying underage decoy operations they involve cigarettes for a reason because kids are buying cigarettes that's what we're doing those programs because they do consume it this makes it more appealing more attractive these kids and young kids especially teenagers are easily influenced and some of these names do influence them in the bottom line this bill you can still buy e-cigarettes doesn't change that you can still sell these cigarettes you can still smoke e-cigarettes what does it change the definition the legislation nothing else so it the rules today remain the same except for the legislation so I really don't know what the big deal is and we're trying to protect our kids it's a bottom line so I respectfully ask for your support for this bill thank you Thank You mr. Cooper we have a motion of do pass as amended to finance it's been seconded Madam Secretary please call the roll Bonta i Vantaa I maintain maintain aye Baker aye Baker aye Bonilla campus Eduardo Garcia Eduardo Garcia aye Levine Levine I maze Santiago Santiago aye steinorth Stein north no stone Thurmond Thurmond I would would I the bill passes with a vote of 8 to 1 Thank You mr. Cooper next we'll call up IC Assemblymember bloom agenda item number 5a BX to 10 local taxes authorization cigarettes and tobacco products welcome Assemblymember bloom whenever you ready mr. chair and members I'll speak slowly well advocates come up but I am here to present a bx2 10 a bill that allows counties to place local tobacco tax measures on the ballot for a public vote the tax would only go into effect if two-thirds majority of the voters approved of course smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States and at least 30 percent of cancer deaths and 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking nationally one out of every 5 deaths is attributable to smoking and in California 40,000 people lose their lives to tobacco related illness each year and tens of thousands of Californians struggle every day because of tobacco related illness treatment for these ailments is often expensive medical spends almost 3.5 billion dollars paying for tobacco related illness despite this California currently has one of the lowest tobacco taxes in the country mr. chair move the bill back in 30 finnicky we have a motion in a second with thank you with an 87 percent tax per pack compared to the national average almost twice that a dollar 60 these rates have in California have not been raised in over 15 years and we know the tobacco taxes work for every 10% increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes there's a 4% read and overall cigarette consumption and a 6.5 percent reduction in youth consumption and this is one of the reasons why this bill is so important young people the Surgeon General projects that without a major reversal in trance 5.6 million youth aged 0 to 17 living today will die prematurely from tobacco use those are completely preventable deaths and today it is estimated that 16 percent of high school students 16 percent are addicted to cigarettes this is in spite of all the work we've done in the successes that we've had I think it's an important point that we're not there yet it's 16 percent of high school students are addicted to cigarettes and 1 in 4 use some form of tobacco though there's widespread education on the dangers of tobacco availability and deceptive marketing continues to lure our youth to try these dangerous products so this bill is an important step to fight tobacco addiction and tobacco related illness and will allow California counties to join over 600 local jurisdictions nationwide that have their own cigarette taxes or fees these jurisdictions bring in more than four hundred and thirty million dollars in annual revenue and working effectively and are working for effectively to reduce smoking rates again especially amongst young people and to decrease smoking cause death disease and costs increasing the cost of cigarettes is one of the most powerful and direct ways to reduce smoking studies have shown that youth and low-income adults are especially likely to quit or reduce smoking smoking I'm sorry when prices increase no one is better equipped to know how to fight tobacco addiction on the local level and the voters themselves and this bill allows the Board of Supervisors of a county to propose these kinds of measures to their constituents the bill is a sensible measure to help counties deter tobacco use locally and I urge your aye vote Thank You mr. bloom witnesses in support good afternoon chair and members Lindsey Freitas with the American Lung Association in California this bill as was mentioned would remove the current prohibition against counties passing local taxes and help prevent kids from smoking improve public health and help generate local revenue nearly 40,000 Californians die from tobacco related illness each year and smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States killing more people than alcohol aids car accidents illegal drugs murder and suicide combined as the assembly member mentioned tobacco taxes whether the state federal local level have been a proven and effective way to reduce tobacco use among youth in particular a 10% increase leading to a 6 point 5 percent reduction in youths consumption in California we currently have 21,000 youth who start smoking every year and over forty four hundred and forty thousand kids under the age of 18 today that will ultimately die from tobacco-related disease by allowing counties to tax tobacco we can take help make sure they can take that step to ensure that these kids never start smoking and lower that number not only will this bill allow counties the opportunity to save lives but also money this bill will give counties a chance to pass a tax that will ultimately help save millions of dollars overall tobacco-related disease cost medic hell 3.5 billion dollars a year it inflicts thirteen point two nine billion in total medical expenses in our state each year and ten point three five billion dollars in lost productivity these numbers are a huge burden to our state on average California families tax burden from smoking caused government expenditure is seven hundred and forty five dollars per household on a County to County basis the cost of smoking varies from three hundred and seventy four dollars per resident in Orange County to over a thousand dollars per resident in Lake County and the total cost vary from around 300,000 in Alpine County a total cost to 4.4 billion dollars in Los Angeles County alone of all these associated Kaufman all of these associated costs will decrease as the number of people decrease smoking and this bill really gives counties the the empowerment to help make happen thank you good afternoon Tim Gibbs American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we're it's for this legislation because we think that local communities should be given a choice when it comes to going beyond state law to protect their citizens from the deadly effects of tobacco use allowing counties the ability that give voters a choice on whether a higher tobacco tax makes sense for the community is the essence of local control one of the most pernicious tactics that the tobacco companies use in order to stymie legislation ensure that no policies passed that result in fewer people smoking is to preempt local governments from passing tobacco control legislation their modus operandi is to pass a weak law at the state level where they wield more power and then prevent locals from improving on the weak policy the most part California has a long history of resisting the tobacco company's attempt to preempt local efforts to reduce smoking the reason we're able to pass the nation's first smoke-free workplace law was because local efforts made that happen local communities have the ability to decide for themselves on whether or not they want to protect workers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoking across the state communities active which eventually led to the state enact a new minimum standards for smoke-free workplaces many communities have chosen to go beyond the minimum standards since the state has set we've also resisted preemption excuse me in local licensing ordinances that give law enforcement the ability to enforce youth access laws unfortunately the one area where the tobacco companies have been successful in preventing local communities from protecting their citizens has been in taxes nearly 50 years ago California decided not to allow counties to levy tobacco taxes with one at 600 jurisdictions across the country that can live with you their own taxes we want to give our 58 counties the ability to decide for themselves this isn't a vote about raising taxes this is a vote about establishing local control and stopping the tobacco companies from pre-empting counties from reducing smoking we hope that you agree that counties deserve to decide from themselves and we respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you additional

Donald Lyman California Academy of preventive medicine in support Matt Reed on behalf of Breathe California in the breath California affiliates in support thank you seeing no additional witnesses in support witnesses in opposition please come forward [Music] whenever you ready Thank You mr. chairman members gentle slow for representing the California distributors Association we are the taxpayers it's not the it's not the tobacco manufacturers it's not the retailer's it's not the consumers the tax is applied to distributors many of which are family businesses here in California and would have trouble maintaining taxes in some over 50 counties if that were to happen also it was it should be noted that there was local taxes up until 1967 and in 1967 the legislature and the League of Cities removed that because of the chaos that caused in the marketplace and that there was casual bootlegging in that you could be across the street in one jurisdiction and have attacks and not on another and it because it became a problem so which they moved it back to a state only tax which makes sense you know in essence it's a tax on the distributors and that's a very small community of family mostly family-owned businesses and for those reasons we oppose Thank You mr. Loper my name is gregory connelly again on behalf of the american vaping association while this bill does not impact vapor products at the moment would not give local counties the authority to tax them i would still urge opposition the speaker from the American Lung Association earlier I applaud her for accurately noting that it is smoking that kills it is smoking that results in 400,000 deaths plus per year it is smoking that results in the cost of Medicare Medicaid throughout this state is not smoke free tobacco and nicotine products some of which would be included in this bill such as Swedish snus which we have decades of evidence from Sweden on its effectiveness for helping smokers quit while we don't advocate for that individual product I advocate for any smoker to switch to any Nick not nicotine smoke free product because they are all far less hazardous whether it is the gum patch lozenge or if it is snus smokers deserve options and they don't deserve to be taxed possibly even more than they are on a pack of cigarettes for trying to get away from some okay thank you thank you additional witnesses in opposition mr. chair members James jack on behalf of the cigar Association of America and opposition Peter blocker at the California tax payers Association in opposition thank you seeing no additional witnesses in opposition we can go to questions and comments from members seeing Assemblymember Baker Thank You mr. chairman and Thank You mr. bloom for bringing this forward I struggled with this one a bit and I find one of I find the points that have been raised by the opposition compelling and in particular the the market chaos that was caused and also just making this become something that is almost an underground product because you can use it more across borders depending on what the taxation policy is there when our goal is I think a legitimate goal is to reduce reliance on this product so you know can you just address some of the points of opposition you may be doing that in your closing anyway but I would value that thank you I'm happy to and I'll allow the advocates to respond as well if that's all right i I just don't see this as a significant problem there may be different taxes in different jurisdictions but wherever one goes to shop one's going to pay the the taxes levied in that location and if there's some people going to a different County to purchase that doesn't change the overall impact of what we're trying to accomplish here yeah and more than 60% of smokers buy one pack at a time I mean the vast majority of smokers want to quit smoking buying a cart and driving to Nevada driving you know you know wherever the next county over where you're from it could be a long long way from Alameda County to Contra Costa County depending on traffic so you know most smokers don't want to make that commitment to buy multiple packs of cigarettes are going to stop at their local store and pay you know the tax that's in their local community an Assemblymember I challenged the notion that in 1967 the law was changed because of chaos in 1967 the law was changed to provide a statewide only statewide authorization in order to benefit the tobacco companies for the very reasons that we heard earlier it is easier for tobacco companies to restrict the amount of taxation at the state level than it is at the local level well thank you and I imagine what I think is very possible which is now perhaps someone buys one pack at a time but if they all they have to do is go from say Contra Costa County San Ramon into Pleasanton or Livermore and buy a lot more at once in order to avoid the tax that is a concern I have it's also somewhat more regressive as well if someone can just manage to pay the tax where the additional funds wherever it is they can do that unless they would rather go somewhere else and get them more in bulk that's a possibility I'm thinking of and and I have a constituency that many of my local towns are very aggressive against smoking and I find it is perfectly possible for them to say you're not going to do it in apartments you're not going to do it in streets and you're not going to do it in public anywhere and so I was persuade you know I liked the idea of local constituencies being able to decide this I'm a no vote today because I think there is this real possibility of just creating a very easy way for people to get around it and it can create either there's going to be bulk purchases or even driving it a little bit more underground than it already is thank you we have a motion we have a second some a member bloom would you like to close thank you well it sounds like at least one of our opponents sitting at the table here should have been in the support line because I was hearing a lot of support for the notion of taxing these tobacco products that we're talking about here today but I I want to be clear on this this is a very democratic measure this allows democratically elected local government officials to choose by their vote to ask the voters by a tooth majority to enact an increase in tax so there's a double layer of democracy here that we would be passing back to counties that we took away from them many years ago that will provide all the benefits that you've heard from today I don't talk about this a lot because it's a long time ago in my past but I used to work as a young person in a tobacco and candy warehouse and I could tell you at that time when we didn't have technology to help with the system of paying taxes it was really easy at that time we used to just iron on it was a way of applying the tax you you the the company would purchase would amount to little seals that went on each pack of cigarette and so you wrote a check to the State Board of Equalization as a distributor this is a very at that time it was not a complicated process it was very easy it hasn't gotten any more complicated for the industry it has only gotten easier to provide the the service that they provide as individuals so this is not going to have an impact on small businesses it's been claimed this is something that is simple to apply whatever county you might be in and I ask for your aye vote thank you Thank You mr. bloom we have a motion we have a second the motion is do pass Madame secretary please call the roll Bonta I ought to I may shine moonshine no Baker Baker no Bonilla Bonilla aye Campos Campos aye Garcia Garcia aye Levine Levine aye Mayes Santiago Santiago aye steinorth stein North no stone Thurmond Thurmond aye wood Wood aye the bill passes with a vote of eight to three Thank You mr. bull see I see some member Nazarian here welcome mr. Nazarian we are on to agenda item number 6a bx2 11 Nazarian cigarette and tobacco product licensing fees and funding mr. Nazarian whenever you're ready Thank You mr. chair and members since 2003 the Board of Equalization has administered the cigarette and tobacco products light sassing program which levies licensing fees on businesses that sell and distribute tobacco products in the state since the launch of the program a fee the fee has not changed for the last 12 years it has remained as a one-time fee of $100.00 per retail location and an annual $1,000 fee on distributors and wholesalers a b11 modernizes the program by updating the licensing fee imposed on retail locations distributors and wholesalers the bill establishes annual fees as two hundred and sixty five dollars per retail location annually and 100 a 1012 $1200 excuse me two distributors and wholesalers in 2003 to 2004 the licensing fee generated eighteen million which at that time was sufficient to maintain the program however because of the retailer fee and being one-time only the cost to run the program has exceeded the revenue generated from the fee according to the Legislative Analyst's Office between 2005 fiscal year 2005 six two fiscal year 2013-14 annual expenditures averaged 7 million more than the annual fee generated board of a Board of Equalization estimated for fiscal year 2013 to 14 the program cost of nine point six million and only generated 1.8 million from licenses licensees a lot of numbers here but bottom line is there's a shortfall we only generate 1.8 million while the enforcement takes about 12 million as a result Board of Equalization requires payment from special funds that receive cigarette and tobacco tax proceeds to cover the administration cost of licensing program it is evident that the lifetime retailer fee is not adequate to maintain a viable enforcement program which is good for businesses as it stops violators from circumventing the law and competing with legitimate businesses speaks to some of the concerns that I heard before a goal of the licensing program is to reduce illegal sales of cigarette and tobacco products and with me are three witnesses to speak on behalf of the bill thank you very much for your attention thank you mr. Nazarian that we since we have through it three witnesses it'll be two minutes each and we will give you the time indications please proceed good afternoon chairman and members of the committee kula Koenig with the American Heart Association American Stroke Association our goal at the AAA is to build lives free of cardiovascular disease and stroke we know that smoking increases the risk of heart disease and stroke by two to four times we are in support of this bill because it addresses a problem that has existed for far too long the Board of Equalization does not have adequate funding to cover the cost of running the tobacco licensing program by adjusting the fee structure as this bill proposes the BOE would generate approximately twelve million dollars equipping the organization with the resources it needs to prevent untaxed distribution and illegal sales of cigarettes and tobacco as Assemblymember Nazarian mentioned the BOE has stated that without the proper resources the organization would have a difficult time discouraging tax evasion which could result in decrease revenues for the fund they also noted that the lack of ability to enforce could jeopardize California's master settlement agreement payments if it is determined that California is not diligently enforcing its cigarette and tobacco product statutes the bill simply asks the valkyries least tailors to pay for the cost of doing business in the state similar organizations such as the alcoholic beverage control their license is $13,000 as a start-up fee where we're asking here two hundred and sixty five dollars this is fair and sensible public policy ask for your aye vote good afternoon Whitney Stanford on behalf of first five California and the first five Association first we want to thank mr. Assemblymember Nazarian for his leadership on this important issue the board of equalizations tobacco tax licensing administration and enforcement activities have increased by 700 percent over the last 10 years and now costs first-five an estimated 14 million dollars in annual proposition 10 funds during this same decade total first five tobacco tax revenue have decreased by 30 percent the 14 million dollar cost of BOE administration and enforcement pay out paid out of the first five fund is an amount roughly equal to the first five County Commission's statewide investment in health access programs including premiums outreach and enrollment or it is roughly equivalent to their total investments in infinite all their education and care programs clearly there are many alternative and more impactful uses of these critical funds in line with the mandates of proposition 10 a b 11 is a crucial step to resolve this cost to children's programs consistent with the intent of a b 71 in 2003 a b 11 would ensure that tobacco tax licensees bear the cost of ongoing licensing administration and enforcement activities and refocus first-five funds on their intended beneficiary children ages 0 to 3 in California thank you very much mr. chair members autumn Ogden with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also proud support of assembly bill 11 this bill is important because it will preserve critical programs by ensuring there's enough funding for the licensing program in 2006 the legislature approved a budget proposal allowing the BOE to fill in the funding gap by siphoning from the four funding sources that receive money from excise tax the general fund the Breast Cancer Fund proposition 10 and proposition 99 which funds the tobacco control program the amount taken from each fund is directly proportional to the amount each fund receives the tobacco control program on the second highest of these funds has saved over a million lives and has saved the state over 100 a billion since it was first started unfortunately the program is underfunded and part 2 and part due to this licensing program it receives currently 17% of the funding recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the reduction means fun the reduction and funding means that the benefits of the program have also decreased the money from these funds was voted on to create critical programs which support tobacco education and Prevention and Tobacco related disease research by allowing the BOE to continue to divert funding tobacco excise tax revenue to cover the shortfall we deplete the life-saving programs that for of critical funding by revising this program and supporting SB 11 a b 11 sorry we are able to cover the cost without having to pillage other programs thank you thank you additional witnesses in support mr. chairman members Terry Brennan on behalf of SEIU California in support Megan all right on behalf of the California Dental Association and support Vanessa Hina on behalf of the California Society of Anesthesiologists and support Tim Madame herbs in the California Chapter of the American College of Cardiology in support stated for the Association of Northern California oncologists and the medical oncology Association of Southern California in support the Jerry Chaffee representing the California chronic care coalition in support Lydia borne representing American Academy of Pediatrics in support Jasmine Gordon on behalf of the California black health network in support Justin Garrett with the March of Dimes in support Kimberly Chen with the California pan-ethnic Health Network in support Lindsay Freitas with the American Lung Association in California in support Sean south of the California primary care association and support so I assume on behalf of Health Access California in support polizia centers with the California Medical Association in support Matt Reed on behalf of breathe California in the Breathe California affiliates in support dr.

7 which is about smoking in the workplace California has led the nation or had led the nation in its laws that protect its citizens from secondhand smoke but unfortunately a lot of those laws had left open some loopholes other states are getting ahead of us in our ability to protect against secondhand smoke what this bill does is close some of those loopholes and ensure that more workplaces in California will be smoke-free I do have witnesses in support and I ask for your aye vote Thank You mr. chair and members Kelly haft on behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association really excited about this bill that would eliminate loopholes in current law that allow for smoking in the workplace there is overwhelming scientific evidence that secondhand smoke is a direct cause of heart disease the number one killer for both men and women in California in the nation the US Surgeon General support in 2006 found that even brief exposure to secondhand smoke can have an immediate out of adverse effect on the cardiovascular system smoking cost the state of California twenty three billion dollars a year in both health costs and lost productivity with three and a half billion dollars directly linked to medical alone in addition to the economic burden of smoking there is a human cost to last year 43,000 Californians lost their lives to smoking and tobacco related illness and disease once the nation's leader in protecting workers from the deadly effects of secondhand smoke California has fallen behind the national standards set by the CDC and is not considered a 100 percent smoke-free state 26 other states and the District of Columbia provide greater smoke secondhand smoke protection in the workplace in California in fact one in seven workers report being exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace in California low-income workers young adults and Latinos are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at work exposure to secondhand smoke should not be a condition of employment it is time for California to catch up with the rest of the nation every Californian deserves to work in a healthy environment and should not have to make a choice between a good health or good job we have the opportunity to do that today and I respectfully urge your aye vote thank Thank You additional witnesses in support chairman Ponte and members Terry Brennan on behalf of SEIU California the argument is simple here no one should have to as a condition of employment risk their health and risk their life we work with a lot of Public Safety folks who do it knowingly the average worker shouldn't have to suffer the same fate so we are drive out on the bill mr. chairmembers Sara flocks Micallef or Nia Labor Federation we help to enact restrictions on workplace smoking in 1994 now is the time to close the loopholes in that original law so that we protect worker health and safety we urge your aye vote thank you Thank You additional witnesses in support David fort for the medical oncology Association of Southern California and the association of Northern California oncologists in support Tim Maddon representing the California Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians in support that's the Armstrong with the county health executives in support Vanessa here on behalf of California Society of Anesthesiologists here in support the cherry cheffy representing California chronic care Coalition in support Meghan all red representing the California Dental Association in support so I assume on behalf of Health Access California and support Lindsay Freitas American Lung Association in California and support Gregory Kramer from Planned Parenthood affiliates of California and support Kimberly Chen with the California pan-ethnic Health Network in support Alesia Sanchez with the California Medical Association in support video born American Academy of Pediatrics and support Justin Garrett with the March of Dimes in support Sean South with the California Primary Care Association in support Jasmine Gordon on behalf of the California block Health Network in support Matt Reed on behalf of breathe California in the breath California affiliates and support brainy Roberts for the Health Officers Association of California in support Tim Gibbs American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and support dr. Donald Lyman from the california academy of preventive medicine and support thank you see no additional witnesses in support witnesses in opposition please come forward let's make some space for our witnesses in opposition please mr. chairman and members James Jack on behalf of the cigar Association of America the national trade association representing the cigar manufacturing industry our association has an oppose unless amended position on this bill we are asking for a relatively minor amendment to exclude the prohibition of smoking in cigar retailers and private cigar lounges oftentimes cigar smokers prefer not to smoke at home because they do not want to expose their families or their children to secondhand smoke cigar lounges provide an environment for cigar enthusiasts where they can enjoy each other's company in a venue that non-smokers do not frequent and where minors are not allowed the SCAR Association of America has no quarrel with the remainder of the prohibitions in this bill but would ask for the author's consideration and the Committees of that minor amendment in order to remove our opposition thank you good afternoon again my name is gregory connelly with the nonprofit the american vaping association now that you have passed through the earlier tobacco bill making the use of smoke free vapor products smoking it is critical that the amendment that the person from the cigar association advocated for also be passed because vape shops all throughout california if this amendment is not put in would be unable to allow people to sample products to see what flavor will help them get off of cigarettes to test the product to see exactly how they work to troubleshoot to get problems done by trained employees that will all go away if that amendment is not put in I also want to speak to one of the exemptions that you're removing seems especially silly in the context of vapor products which is the only thing that we are speaking on banquet rooms I was just at an event ECC it was called in Pomona with thousands of vapors with exhibiting vapor products a restricted etc that event is now banned in California if the prior bill goes through but we had a private function afterwards for about 50 people 75 people and vaping was allowed in the banquet room of the hotel that will no longer be the case if this exemption passes I would also urge you in California there's an exemption if this amendment is put in for retail and wholesale tobacco outlets it is very unclear because California's never really had a cigarette manufacturing industry as far as I know vaping meanwhile you have possibly hundreds of businesses throughout California they manufacture in professional labs but they do not have retail or wholesale storefronts so the question is if I am a manufacturer and I have made new eliquid in my facility filled with only employees who vape do I then have to step outside to try the product to determine if that's something that I want to make it makes no sense it's very unclear so you have these manufacturing facilities they should be welcome they are providing good jobs some of these people 50 75 people they employ with health care but you may send the people that are creating the actual doing the actual manufacturing outside to do product testing it just doesn't make sense and it may make sense for cigarettes because they would harm the employees around them but with vapor products especially if you put in something about ventilation there's no harm in a manufacturing facility to be able to use them and thank you for your time Thank You additional witnesses in opposition I strongly oppose my name is Kirsten sure hole from bourbon California representing great Verity and we strongly oppose this bill

stone aye Thurmond theremin I would put I the bill passes 10 to 2 next item number 3 a B X - 8 dr. would tobacco products minimum legal age whenever you ready doctor would great thank you very much chair and members this bill essentially raises the legal minimum age for smoking from 18 to 21 we can talk statistics all day long on this issue but I want to talk a bit about my personal experience as a health care provider and the tol tobacco took on the lives of the people who entrusted me to their care in 27 years of practice as a dentist I never had a patient say to me boy am I glad I started smoking indeed nationwide 90% of smokers wish they had never started I saw oral disease progressed before my eyes I saw tooth loss yelling of teeth significant decay gum disease and yes oral cancer in addition to nicotine being a highly addictive substance the continued constriction it causes blood vessels in the oral cavity is what leads to poor circulation gum disease and ultimately the loss of teeth I want to spend just a minute on smokeless tobacco which is common among youth particularly in the more rural areas of our state and a district that I represent the constant irritation to the area of the mouth where the wad of tobacco is placed can result in permanent damage to gum tissue precancerous tissue changes an oral cancer that can invade the bone injured gums pull away from the teeth exposing root surfaces and leaving teeth susceptible to decay receding gums and the erosion of bone the supports leads to tooth loss seeing young people whose oral health is being destroyed by tobacco is tragic and knowing that continued use will at a minimum lead to thousands of dollars a restorative dental care potential disfigurement due to bone loss at worst tobacco leads to oral and systemic cancers requiring treatments in the tens of thousands or hundreds of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars and that that treatment leaves an impact on a person's quality of life ironically my younger patients who had been educated about the problems related smokeless tobacco often insisted on her oral cancer exam and we routinely did for all of our patients even with their health concerns the addiction is so strong it's really really difficult for them to stop but back to smoking I saw patients who were good friends fight cancer heart disease emphysema emphysema and lose their battle to stop smoking the addiction is so great that many of them even during radiation chemotherapy just can't quit and it's really painful to watch we know what it's a killer tobacco products are we know how the industry works to attract the next generation of victims through advertising product making manipulation and enhancement yet for years we have been reluctant to say enough let's do something productive to stem the Sun stem the tide and save millions of lives in the future you may hear from witnesses that this infringes on people's right to choose what they do to their bodies I see it just delays the timeframe a bit and maybe just maybe that person won't make a bad decision and if they do they will still have a life time to enjoy the deadly products and the adverse and health impacts that will come with them in the 1970s we lowered the drinking age from 21 to 18 we found as a result that motor vehicle accidents of fatalities skyrocketed in this age group eventually over many years under the threat of loss of federal highway hunt funding gradually this moved back to 21 and we saved lives this is precedent this this precedent for adjusting an age to accomplish strong public health objectives is before us the momentum is surging across the nation New York City and Hawaii have both passed laws to restrict access to tobacco and nicotine products before 21 as mayor my hometown of Healdsburg we were the first in California to raise the age to purchased tobacco and 12 to 21 others have followed including recently Santa Clara County in July 2015 the CDC released a study that concludes that 75% of adults favor raising the tobacco age to 21 and that includes 70% of smokers the small city of Needham Massachusetts took a bold move in 2005 and restricted the sale of tobacco products before the age 21 while many thought it was a symbolic effort the results over the next few years surprised people over the next five years in the twenty nine suburb surrounding Boston there was a slight decrease in the number and the amount of teen smoking but in Needham Massachusetts it dropped by 50% experts attribute this decreased the loss of social sources teen smoking is enabled by older teens buying for the younger raising the age to 21 works 21 year olds are much less likely than 18 year olds to buy tobacco products for their 14 year old friends I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to present this bill I'm here with me today our Beverly Mei with tobacco free kids and dr. Don Lyman with the California Academy of preventive medicine in support of the bill California's efforts to reduce tobacco use can you press the button on your mic it's on it's on can you hear now okay yes much better thank you okay the campaign for tobacco-free kids as a nation largest non-profit non-governmental advocacy solely devoted to reducing tobacco use tobacco remains the nation's number one preventable cause of premature death and disease raising the legal age for the sale of tobacco products to 21 complements California's current tobacco prevention and control efforts and is an important step that will protect youth and young adults from the unrelenting efforts of the tobacco industry to a dick them to a product that will kill one in three of them earlier this year the Institute of Medicine one of the most prestigious scientific authorities in the world concluded that raising the tobacco age to 21 will have a substantial positive impact on public health and save lives the IOM found that raising the tobacco age will significantly reduce the number of adolescents and young adults who start smoking reduce smoking cause dust and immediately improve the health of adolescents young adults young mothers who would be charged from smoking as well as their children raising the tobacco age is popular with the public as was mentioned before by the sponsor by a poll that was or a study that was released by the Centers for Disease Control raising the age will help protect our youth from a lifetime of addiction to a deadly progress product 95% of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21 and about 80% first try their first cigarette before age 18 I think it's really important a couple things I want to cover in my last minute here is we talked about the military the minimum age and military service does not equate to readiness to enlist in a lifetime of nicotine addiction tobacco is bad for military preparedness and the Department of Defense has stepped up efforts to help service members quit in addition to harming troops health tobacco use is a huge financial drain on the DoD and VA health care systems the og spends more than 1.6 billion dollars each year on tobacco related medical care I will end by saying it's important to remember that the age 18 is not the age of majority for everything from buying alcohol to running for certain political offices and so on the appropriate age for various activity is based on evaluating risk and other factors tobacco use is addictive it's deadly activity and most people never make that choice to smoke as an adult the industry targets young people and that is who start smoking the policy will help protect them we urge swift passage thank you very much thank you mr. chairman members good afternoon I'm dr. Donald Lyman I'm here representing the California Academy of preventive medicine which is in support of the statute I recently retired from the Department of Public Health State's Department of Public Health where I ran the tobacco control program this is a very successful program we have cut the adult smoking rate by 50% about 22% down to about 11 and 12 percent we've also cut the amount of tobacco consumed by about 80 percent it's it's just wonderful concurrently 25 years later we have cut the lung cancer rate in California by about 25 percent that's spectacular this is like a vaccine against cancer it's very nice now in the statute which authorizes this program don't think of the vaccine bono though don't go there now in the statute for this program you have required us to reduce the adult smoking rate to 7% we're now at 11 to 12 percent and we're heading that way but we've run into a big problem it's the tobacco industry they have targeted this age group 18 to 21 for a high profile attention and they've done that for a reason then you've heard it they know this is the highest risk population for addiction if they try them much higher frequency of people go on to addiction the other is that this is the group which supplies tobacco to their younger friends the teenagers where we don't want this stuff to go so weird a head-to-head with the tobacco industry and we need your help and this is part of that help so I urge a yes vote thank you thank you additional witnesses in support Whitney Stanford on behalf of first 5 California and the first 5 Association in

members my name is Pete Conaty I'm retired Army officer and spent 21 years in the Army a tour in Vietnam or I spent a lot of time trying to stomp out or stop our servicemen from using marijuana so they could remain alert so this is an interesting journey I represent the American Legion the American Veterans the Vietnam Veterans of America the Military Officers Association the United's the United States Army the fleet reserve Association the Military Order of the Purple Heart and the Jewish War veterans and we are posed in as legislation for reasons stated in the analysis but I'm old enough to remember when there were only about two states where our servicemen and women had could be vote at age 18 all other states were 21 and the movement during the Vietnam War was if you're old enough to fight and die for your country you ought to have a say in who we elect and so every state has passed legislation lowering the voting age to 18 but now we're going to take that right away from our military forces in the state of California and raise the age to 21 California has more active duty military reservists and National Guard than any other state and they have their two here and contrary to previous testimony being in the military is more dangerous to your health than smoking so these people are adults that are willing to put their life on the line for their country and they ought to be able to go buy a pack of cigarettes if they want to thank you good afternoon chair and distinguished members of the committee again this will be the last time you'll hear from me today my name is gregory connelly on behalf of the american vaping association i'd like to bring something to your attention as a resident of new jersey which is one of the i believe four states that have that had previously raised the age to buy tobacco to 19 which i think is reasonable and does do an effective job at keeping tobacco out of high schools i turn 19 approximately a couple may believe a couple weeks before the law went into effect so I was 19 and I could legally buy cigarettes meanwhile my friends who were 18 who let's say on Monday they could go into the store and legally purchase cigarettes tobacco e-cigarettes whatever they wished the next day all of a sudden it became a crime for someone to sell them a tobacco product I would strongly encourage you to at least if you're going to do is I'm not going to be able to change your minds I recognize that but grandfathering in existing legal smokers you hear these groups that talk about how the reason why these 18 year olds and 19 year olds are smoking is because they've been targeted and they've been targeted for addiction well have some sympathy for the 18 19 and 20 year olds they are going to have to go to their friends and they're going to have to put their friends in a very precarious legal position to purchase and acquire tobacco for them not all and I don't believe even a majority of 18 19 and 20 year old smokers will quit if this law goes into effect all they will be doing is making criminals out of their friends and I'd like to add this bill I believe due to the earlier definition change and another bill would include non nicotine paper products I think it stretches the imagination to say that servicemen and women or even me when I was 20 could not purchase a vapor product I will show you this I would pass it around this is tobacco free snuff nicotine free snuff it comes in cherry it is essentially you could say that it's a training product to use actual snuff I'd like to move the bill it will remain available to youth under this bill but no nicotine vapor products will not I'll repeat since you look a little confused non nicotine vapor products nick of a ver products that do not contain nicotine will be illegal to those under 21 meanwhile imitations snuff smokeless tobacco products that don't actually contain tobacco they are designed to look and feel and taste just like tobacco 1819 1716 doesn't matter your age you can keep buying it but if you want to buy a vapor product possibly to quit smoking even if it doesn't contain nicotine well until you're legal to drink you can't buy it I don't think that makes sense and I would really urge grandfathering in and perhaps looking to the non nicotine issue thank you thank you Sara additional witnesses in opposition seeing none Assemblymember Bonilla questions and comments from members so as it looks like there's a few members of the public that weren't quite ready to state their opposition so why don't you go ahead and line up and as that's happening we can entertain a second to mr. Levine's motion we have a second from assembly member stone thank you no Sara friend San Jose California opposed my name is Matthew Villarreal from Los Angeles California and I oppose ed wolf this changes a b6 which you said it would not change the adult age and now it will with this bill so you're now changing what you said you wouldn't do what we're doing here or you're stating your name your organization or your city and your position that's it please representing their name from Burbank California and we strongly oppose this bill Thank You Robin panic Elif Vallejo LLC and I oppose this bill Jonathan Thomas with flawless manufacturing distribution strongly opposed John Kavanagh from vaping industries Costa Mesa strongly opposed Chris capo vaping industries Costa Mesa strongly opposed Daniel Salazar army event I strongly oppose James Lewis small business owner opposed Ryan's in ski and I'm California strongly opposed bravo seus Fullerton California and I strongly oppose rich Kelly bill and vapors I strongly oppose Natalie Gomez San Jose I strongly oppose Lisa kill at Santa Fe Springs California villain vapors I strongly oppose James strong to such a California ECC VPX I strongly oppose Kyle Ryan San Jose California I strongly oppose Bobby Williams representing 493 out of Rocklin California I strongly oppose Josh will curb you with faux tastic vapors opposed Joshua french-fry Celie California I oppose mark rodriguez rizal california post georgia Rosco still serving in the military and I strongly oppose thank you see no additional witnesses in opposition Assemblymember Bonilla I'm I noticed in the analysis the opposition about the military and isn't true that on military bases servicemen can drink wine and beer if there is that correct if they're not to be for their 21 no that is not correct to the drinking age on military basis is 21 but perhaps we will try and change that next year well that's interesting because I because I was thinking we you know looking at the consistency if that was the case but it isn't the case I mean I I certainly understand the frustration in that environment around the yeah age being 21 I think it's something that's worth looking at I understand I support the bill I understand all the risks but when we start talking about risk and we're talking about our young men and women serving in the military there's a little irony there that I think you know makes it makes it a more difficult discussion so I I think that I support the bill but I think it's something we really do need need to look at it's a it's an exception that I think is understandable to make thank you any other members with questions or comments thank you seeing none we have a motion we have a second doctor what would you like to close yeah I just like to address the the issue around military service because it's come up a couple different ways so indeed we can't send a person to Ward 18 and but that in my mind doesn't mean that we we should shouldn't be for trying to protect them in other ways many of my patients who were the heaviest smokers were often veterans and maybe that's because it was so much easier and cheaper to get tobacco products in the military than it is anywhere else I love my country I'd do anything for it I protect it and including going to war myself so that my son wouldn't have to go who's nineteen years old and if I could change the age of military service I'd do that too but I can't do that those eligible for military service cannot legally drink until you're 21 years old you can't rent a car until you're 25 so what does that tell you about how the insurance industry assesses risk I and and a person's judgment and their in their age of maturity so so I I'm you know I don't buy it I think that you know unfortunately the a lot of the veterans that I have seen that been the heaviest smokers have also had the heaviest health impacts and we quite frankly are paying for all of that so why wouldn't we want to help curb that habit why wouldn't we want to protect our children from this deadly product and so I I think the time to act is now let's move this policy forward let's save lives and let's save the needless suffering let's say the state of California a lot of money in the long run so I ask for your aye vote thank you for your attention thank you dr. wood we have a motion we have a second the motion is due pass to finance Madam Secretary please call the roll Bonta aye I mean Cheyne Baker Baker no Bonilla Bonilla aye Campos Campos aye Garcia Levine Levine aye maze maze no Santiago Santiago aye steinorth stein North no Stone stone aye Thurmond Thurmond aye would I would I the bill passes with a vote of 8 to 3 thank you dr. Whitaker we'll go to our final bill of this hearing item number 4 ABX to 9 Thurmond Assemblymember Thurmond tobacco use programs whenever you're ready Assemblymember Thurmond Thank You mr. chair and members and let me start by saying that I accept the amendments suggested on page 5 of the committee analysis it's my honor to present a B 2 X 9 the tobacco free schools measure we spent the afternoon talking about a central team keeping tobacco out of the hands of young people from being used by young people and from having our young people become addicted to tobacco use I can't think of a place more important than our schools to make sure that we drive home that message and this bill would require all of our schools to maintain tobacco-free campuses for students and for those who work on or who visit our campuses we have no statewide prohibition against smoking on k12 school campuses but yet we do have funding that was passed by Prop 99 by the voters in 1988 that provides funding to school districts and local education associations to be able to provide and enforce tobacco-free campus policies sadly less than 50 percent of local education agencies receive grants and are required to be tobacco-free but we've seen that schools that consistently force tobacco-free policies have shown decrease rates of smoking amongst their students by requiring all le A's to become a hundred percent tobacco-free and by including smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes a v2x nine will help ensure that schools protect students and those who work with our students on our campus while reducing tobacco use among our youth thank you and I respectfully request an aye vote we have three witnesses here today to help us with our message and discussion okay three minutes will be two minutes each thank you good afternoon mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Tammy Silveira I'm a program specialist specialist excuse me with the Elk Grove Unified School District and I coordinate our districts tobacco use prevention education program this program has been in place in Elk Grove for well over 15 years the program provides the funding base that allows us to provide students comprehensive tobacco prevention education numerous opportunities for students to take the lead as tobacco free advocates in their schools and in their community and on campus intervention services for students who are struggling with tobacco use according to our California Healthy Kids survey in 2013 the long-standing work of the Elk Grove Unified School District Program has contributed to a very low 2% usage rate for cigarettes in the seventh and ninth grade and a four percent usage rate in the 11th grade tobacco-free campus policies are integral in the success of an overall tobacco prevention program prohibiting the use of any kind of tobacco or nicotine products on school grounds and during any school function demonstrates our commitment to keeping children tobacco-free and providing them a healthy place to learn and grow the benefits of tobacco prevention programming and tobacco-free campus policies also has a ripple effect because the skills that students learn and the messages they receive to combat the pressures of smoking extend to other critical health choices that they need to make as youth and young adults while California's made great strides its tobacco use prevention efforts we cannot ever consider this task complete every new generation of young people needs to receive this level of education and should allowed to learn and grow in a smoke-free environment I strongly encourage your support thank you thank you we have motion in a second for the bail Alesia Sanchez representing the California Medical Association the author and ms Silveira have done a good job of explaining the importance of tobacco's free schools I would just add that when I talk with people about this bill it creates a bit of cognitive dissonance because most people assume that schools are already tobacco 100% tobacco free when in fact we know that they're not and the other thing that I would note is that universally when we talk about tobacco control we hear that there we need to have a strong educational component and the example that schools provide in having 100% tobacco-free campuses is a major component of that education for youth and so we urge your support for this legislation thank you I will be very quick Lindsay Freitas with the Lung Association I believe these two ladies covered everything so I just urge your support thank you Thank You additional

Monning aye Nielsen Nielsen aye Pavley Wolk Wolk aye that currently that current vote count is five we will put that bill on call to the absent members return going in order we are now at file item number six Courbet SB 648 electronic cigarettes restriction of use and advertising thank you very much mr. chair this is as you stated Senate bill six four eight Senate bills Senate bill six four eight seeks to add electronic cigarettes to California's existing smoke-free laws we're working with staff to deal with a technical issue noted on page six of the analysis dealing with the Code section and we're committed to continue to work on that as the bill moves through with your staff electronic cigarettes that also known as ISA Guerette sour battery-powered devices that provide inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized propylene glycol and nicotine mixture through the push of an e-cigarette and they're usually manufactured to resemble traditional cigarettes e-cigarettes are not emission free studies have shown the vaporized substances created create an aerosol of particles that are released into the air and the vapor includes elements that are known to be harmful to health in a study published last month just in March the researchers from the University of California examined the aerosol contents of e-cigarettes they found particles of silver iron aluminum silicate tin chromium and nickel the SiC the researchers noted that concentrations of these metal components were higher than or equal to the corresponding concentrations in conventional cigarette smoke so let me just reread this they found that the concentrations were higher than or equal to the corresponding concentrations in conventional cigarette smoke and that many of the elements identified an e-cigarette vapor cause respiratory distress and disease a growing number of state and local governments have moved to prohibit ecig arete use in public places often under existing our new smoke-free laws Amtrak has banned their use on trains the Navy has banned their use below decks and commercial airlines have banned their usage aboard airplanes the US Department of Transportation is also working on a proposed ban because of concerns about health risks from vapors Senate bill 648 will strengthen our existing smoke-free laws and provide consistent regulation with regard to the use of e-cigarettes with me today I have Alicia Sanchez the legislative advocate for California Medical Association and Lydia borne the legislative advocate for the California black health network to testify in support thank you welcome Alysia Sanchez with the California Medical Association there continue to be significant questions about e-cigarettes including the health risks as Senator Corbett noted as well and their impact on smoking cessation that need to be thoroughly studied and addressed from the California Medical Association's perspective one of the major issues for us is it's complicating the enforcement of our existing smoke-free laws which the CMA was actively supportive of and that they have been those laws have been the foundation of the state success in decreasing tobacco use so you can imagine the confusion that it creates to have someone who is smoking one of these cigarettes in a place where other types of smoking are not allowed in fact I just saw somebody doing it in a hotel the other day and it you know it just is it's jarring and I think it also does really complicate enforcement so we would urge your support for this legislation thank you video borne representing the California black health network we're a 501c3 statewide nonprofit working with local state and federal entities to eliminate health disparities in african-american community our concern primarily is with the likely effect on the african-american community I think we are all aware that smoking rates in California have dropped however when you look at the rates in african-american community they still remain high 18 percent for men 15 percent for women and that rate has remained fairly flat for the last five years we also know in spite of the fact that e cigarettes are are relatively new that there has been almost 100% increase in terms of people using these elect electronic cigarettes and to go along with it with Alicia says I'm a tennis player and on the tennis court I've actually seen people with these cigarettes hanging out of their mouths electronic cigarettes hanging out of their mouths when they play tennis which is rather disconcerting when you think about it according to the FDA they have grave concerns about these these new products and just recently they have said they're in the process process of issuing national regulations so we believe that caution is in order and we we agree that there should not be smoking the electronic cigarettes allowed in non-smoking areas so we're in full support and strong support of SB 648 and ask for your aye vote Thank You anyone else in support of the measure is there any opposition to the measure o to respond at all we have okay that's that's for departments and everybody else and then you go [Music] alright the opposition the three that we'll be presenting please state your name and obviously your position good morning or afternoon chairman Hernandez vice chairman Anderson and members of the committee my name is Gregory Connelly and I serve as the volunteer legislative director for the nonprofit organization the consumer advocates for smoke free alternatives Association known as Casa where the leading us advocate that represents consumers of low risk smoke free alternatives to smoking including vapor products commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes I am here today to encourage you to report unfavorably on Senate bill 648 four years ago SB 648 sponsor senator Corbett attempted to ban the sale of smoke free electronic cigarettes while leaving real cigarettes freely available on the market thankfully Senator Corbett's bill failed to become law had it become law most of the individuals that you see in line today would still be inhaling burning smoke on a daily basis Senator Corbett was wrong on the science four years ago and unfortunately she is still wrong today SB 6 for 8 comes despite a complete lack of evidence showing that electronic cigarette vapor poses a threat to public health bald assertions regarding the unknowns of e-cigarettes are bolide by the science on the subject for example they just brought up the study from the University of California regarding metals found in electronic cigarettes but what they failed to note was that that study found extremely trace levels and there are national and international standards for inhalers for example the Nicorette inhaler does expose even though it is FDA approved it does expose users to the same trace trace levels of lead nickel etc as found in electronic cigarette paper in that study additionally last just in the past month the Journal of tobacco control the top tobacco journal in the nation published a study looking at 13 different e-cigarettes that was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health up to 450 times less chemicals or less constituents of chemicals were found in the e-cigarette vapor as compared to real cigarettes I'd also like to point out one fundamental problem with this bill it is almost guaranteed to never be enforced and I will you could just look at me for about five seconds I will demonstrate now did I just use my electronic cigarette or did I simply hold it up to my lips to simulate the act of active smoking electronic cigarette users can decide whether to release vapor they talked about how it's about airlines have banned them I flew 8 hours to be here today and I it's called stealth vaping I stealth taped on the entire plane right here and there were no issues and coming from New Jersey one of the only two states where the state legislature has banned electronic cigarette use indoors I can confidently tell you that 99% of the California population come five years from now will be completely unaware that this law exists and thus a cigarette use will end up continuing in most places some people have also said that the use of e-cigarettes would normalize smoking cessation well that I would say that do you think that the consumption of Diet Coke normalizes the consumption of sugary beverages the only thing that e cigarette use normalizes is smoking cessation just today I had someone come up to me in the hallway and asked how can I get one of those things and thankfully I was able to tell them that there are at least one e-cigarette store in Sacramento helping hundreds or thousands of people quit smoking every year and closing the use of vapor products poses no threat to bystanders has been found in science does not normalize smoking and in fact only normalizes smoking cessation and if enacted will sir almost certainly never be enforced therefore kasaa urges you to report unfavorably on Senate bill six four eight and I thank you for your time thank you anyone else like to speak in opposition state your name in your position do we have to push the button here yeah it needs to be on I think it's lit already no thank you there we go Darcy McGann I'm from the San Fernando Valley Thank You chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee I'm a chief technology officer for a missile company down in San Fernando senator pavley's district but I'm here to represent my own views and the views of my family actually as a user of electronic cigarettes my wife is a cigarette smoker and when she tried puffing on a disposable e-cigarette alarm bells went off and I had two about just what is this thing that she's trying and it was important because she was doing it a lot so from the scientific perspective things are always a benefit versus of risk so I'm not the expert right but I did do my own research before I allowed her to do it and I wanted to share with you what I found benefit wise it was pretty obvious for she was cutting out about two-thirds of the time that she was puffing on what I knew was bad for her cigarettes you know the state's done a very good job of researching and then in regulating and mitigating the risk of cigarette smoke not only for individuals but for people around them for in the environmental tobacco smoke so she there was two thirds of the cigarette puffing that wasn't going on the 56 and own carcinogens that are in that smoke there's no smoke or ash the house didn't smell there's no cigarette butts waste washing their way to the to the beach all obvious benefits of her doing this and in fact when we were in restaurants now and and at sporting events etc my wife no longer gets up to go and smoke a cigarette instead she can Huff it right there in front of me and in fact I felt good about that so what about the risks you know there's been a lot of studies and there's a lot of data out there but very few conclusions about what all that data means I did look into the FDA report that was mentioned and the recent reports and it really does seem to be a matter of well you'll find something in there the question is is that at a level that's gonna harm people and I and I really think that that's up to somebody like the air research the ARB to decide whether it's a toxic air contaminant or not the nitrous savings that are listed in the reports that were in the syllabus for this this bill in fact are at a level ten times lower than the US government says is harmful to our health so it's not the presence of carcinogens it's not even in fact a question I think of whether they're better than cigarettes everybody agrees they're better than cigarettes the question is are they a risk to everybody else and in in trying to mitigate this risk are we losing a benefit to a four million existing smokers in the California and many more across the nation I think we are I and instead of this bill that an approach where we first use what's already there a be 1807 it establishes a process whereby toxic air contaminants are to be identified by the Air Resources Board it involves the public it involves all the constituents it involves a scientific review panel it's the same process that was used for environmental tobacco smoke in 2001 through 2005 why aren't we using that process now because in fact that very process calls for the evaluation of benefit versus risk and recommends risk mitigation strategies let's instead of worrying about the public in fact being confused by this how about educating the public about the possible benefit and the difference between each cigarettes and regular cigarettes my wife smokes one looks like this it glows blue with the tip there's no confusion about whether this is a cigarette or not and in fact universally there's interest in where did you get that and where can I get it and in fact is it working for you - I am in opposition to this bill I'm an absolute agreement with the work you're doing at trying to protect the public and I ask you to consider other alternatives thank you for the time thank you and next state your name in your position I'm father Jack Kearney I represent the California Association for alcohol and drug educators which is a group that accredits addiction studies programs and over 40 colleges and universities throughout the state of California we also certify camp and trained counselors so we represent the highest level of possible of addiction counselor certification and professionalism state of California in treating addiction we have over 7,000 members that are college professors like myself or students or counselors we have taken a public position in favor of using electronic cigarettes we have done so because they work they work they help smokers this bill which is very well intentioned is probably really gonna make the tobacco companies very happy and the pharmaceutical company is very happy because it's gonna keep people smoking instead of getting off of smoking electronic cigarettes we've already seen in treatment centers results up to 50 to 80 percent of the hardest core smokers in the world which are drug addicts quitting and giving up tobacco and cigarettes because of these wonderful little machines which really don't all look like cigarettes in fact here's a the new priest model you can see it's all black with a little bit of white collar so as a college professor who teaches pharmacology I of course have to study these things presented to my students most of the studies that are used in support of this bill I have my first year students tear apart is junk science because that's what most of them are we need a lot more good science to go to study electronic cigarettes but the clear preponderance of evidence says that overwhelmingly these things are 99 times safer than regular tobacco cigarettes not perfect but 99 times safer the only people using them are smokers who - who are trying to quit so this to punish them to punish them with a bill like this and labeling them and forcing them back outside with the smokers and which was going to set them up for relapse and declaring it a public health hazard we should be having bake sales and car washes to raise money to hand these things out not try and take them away from people so I urge this committee which has in the past shown such graciousness towards people who suffer with addiction to continue that by opposing this bill and and trying really to help thank you thank you and I believe we have one more that's gonna be speaking in opposition before we move to the crowd over here to my left Thank You mr. chair I appreciate your consideration my name is Tracey Nicolas body I'm speaking in opposition to SB 648 and on my own I was a California state police officer from the 1980s through the merge with the CHP in 1994 I was injured in the line of duty and therefore my career over I served under three governors and I vowed to take a bullet for all of you or for the governor also for any citizen being unjustly treated and harmed this is one bullet I cannot take for anyone I also was married to the chief lobbyist for the CCPOA so I saw a lot of stuff going on in here yet never once in all those years have I come before the legislature because I never felt this strongly about any bill this is a very important bill I'm the mother of three beautiful sons and what happened is my 25 year old who I adore as I'm sure you adore your children with smoking a pack of Marlboros a day he was newly married and she had tried many times to quit smoking with no success I wanted to help him so I did my research and I researched these cigarettes and vaping after educating myself I came to the conclusion this is a far healthier alternative no secondhand smoke no stink no chemicals no fire and again as a police officer seeing people flick cigarettes out the window falling in their lap a lot of danger goes along with smoking in fact the vapor is so safe that when I took my granddaughter to Disney on Ice recently they were puffing it out it's the exact same use that they do in fog machines it's the same chemicals used that we are using in our vaping and not one person keeled over dead except a wicked witch who basically had it coming anyway frankly I was a social smoker I like nicotine it calms me down fact I'd really like to smoke right now but um it's good for me no not really it's not good for me at all but neither is bacon or caffeine or sugar and I like those two and God help the person who comes between me and chocolate but besides that since my son and I started using these products we haven't touched a cigarette I haven't had a desire to touch a cigarette which is remarkable and and neither has he my husband has switched and also within a three-month period 12 of my friends have switched over to e-cigarettes and actually I just met one in the hall that a fellow I know who also switched over and I didn't even know about it because they see it and they're like wow we weren't you smoking yeah I was smoking and they want that they want to be healthy they want an alternative to cigarettes I feel this bill is being rushed through without being able to receive correct information considering that no one has been harmed from vaping to date we shouldn't be in such a big hurry to pass this bill I ask that we not be too hasty we're potentially in the presence of something quite amazing and remarkable something that will truly help Californians become smoke-free California has led the way for many states and for that matter the world and don't think for a minute that we're not being closely watched on this one we're about to set a precedence by voting on something that could save future generations from having to watch Debbie and her tracheotomy on TV or seeing photos of black lungs on cigarette packages which frankly don't work they're just kind of disgusting we can also save millions from unnecessary illness and death my children and grandchildren and your children and grandchildren I have a constitutional right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness America shows we're innovators and pioneers and we're the land of the free and the home of the brave I am a pioneer and I'm courageous and I'm speaking to you as an American citizen and for the people who follow me so that they may have the opportunity to be freed from the horrors of cigarettes as we have this bill not only denies me such freedom as to vape in my own home but punishes me by forcing me to stand among smokers inhaling secondhand smoke and tempting me back into the bondage I have just broken free from this bill punishes those of us who are doing exactly what this committee is trying to accomplish we are quitting and we're helping others to quit the community of vapours I've come to know are responsible and self-governing every one of us wants safety standardization and many companies are spearheading this already these are creative minds and health conscious citizens building something wonderful don't knock it down before you see the possibilities it's far easier to wait than to go backwards once the bill is passed I ask that this committee be careful to not throw the baby out with the bathwater because this is a pretty awesome baby and I pray that you vote no on this bill thank you thank you as I mentioned I had asked for originally three individuals to speak at three minutes every one of you went above three minutes but I was trying to be respectful because I understand that you're very passionate but more importantly you want to get your message out reason why I went allowed the fourth is because I know you sent in a note and I thought you were going to be one of the original three so with that with respect for time and I think that each one of the individuals have covered all of the issues with regard to safety the the merits of the issue I will need to extend the same courtesy to the support if they have any additional testimony they'd like to present we can do that after the opposition in all fairness but in but I think what I like to ask is everyone from here on out if you can just please state your name and your position on the bill it would be appreciated I believe we have a microphone these sergeant's will give you one and then we can proceed from this point but thank you Thank You mr. chair I actually do have one viewpoint that wasn't covered I represent the retailers I won't take more than 30 seconds my name is Jim root and versus the consumer perspective on this I wanted to bring something to your attention I'm not a smoker and I've never have been my position is actually to support the spirit of the bill but not the way it's currently written the way it's written it's being handled backwards by trying to regulate this product before studies are completed it could have some very unintended consequences you open the door for manufacturers and retailers to create loopholes or just to call the product something else to circumvent the law this would also undermine this would undermine the ultimate goal of the legislation not to mention the possibility of litigation that can arise from a law that is incomplete so sir I think what we'll do is we'll leave it at that I've been more than fair I've been more than generous in the amount of time so if you can just please state your name and then the position thank you Jim root and I opposed thank you miss bill thank you very much my name is Larry Ross from Carmichael I also oppose the position thank you very much sir

I'm from Anaheim California I oppose this bill Alex you Darby I'm from Los Angeles California and I oppose this bill Jochen do so Alameda County and I oppose this bill Blaine Davis California State University Sacramento student advisor and instructor I oppose this bill Jim batty from here from Orangeville Sacramento County I oppose this bill with the supporters at all would like to say anything because you have some time left or would you like your the author to make it in a closing statement okay any questions or comments from any of the members Center money I thank you mr. chair and I want to thank the author for bringing this forward we've talked some before today's hearing I think some of the concerns voiced by opponents miss one of the points which this doesn't prohibit the product it seeks to regulate the product that said I'm concerned of the regulation potentially having some unintended consequences and so two areas of concern I have as currently drafted somebody who's a renter in an apartment building in the apartment building prohibits smoking of regular tobacco products would they be prohibited under this bill from using an electronic device in their own apartment or potentially face eviction and then the second area of concern relates to a patient in a hospital who has an addiction to smoking tobacco products and to minimize the impacts of not being able to smoke in a hospital setting with this prohibit using an electronic device under some controlled circumstance in a medical setting I mean thank you very much senator Monning and thank you for pointing out the that this bill does not ban the use of e-cigarettes and that I will speak a little bit more on in my closing and we had did have an opportunity to talk this bill would regulate e-cigarettes the same way we regulate cigarettes today so does true there are a list of laws on our books which currently restrict the use of cigarettes and you correctly pointed out that that includes in some cases the prohibition from using smoking cigarettes in apartments in the typical scenario with regard to cigarettes a tenant would know in entering a lease that they would be prohibited so there would have to be some sort of agreement that being said obviously there are smokers who currently live in apartments and we would have to be concerned about that situation for those individuals after having an opportunity to talk to you about that I think it does make sense to take a look at that part of the the bill I'm not interested in repealing the prohibit probation prohibitions of cigarette smoking in apartments but I think it might make sense to look at I don't want to use the word exempting yet but to look at a way to allow for e-cigarettes to be used in spaces where they're not likely going to impact others the primary goal behind this bill is to protect others from the effects of the vapor I cited a study there are concerns nicotine is very addictive the various elements chemicals metals whatever you want to call them that are in the vapor of e-cigarettes can impact the health of others however I would be glad to work with you on this issue of smoking someplace in a non you know public setting and that would include hospitals we'd have to bring in the Hospital Association too because I'm sure they'd some thoughts and concerns well the hospital snare clinics a little trickier because that is a public environment but I I know this is dual referred to judiciary and with your commitment to work on those issues I will be supportive today but withhold a final vote in Judiciary Committee based on the progress we might make on this but I appreciate your attention administer to those issues because again I think that I'm not convinced of the public health impacts at this stage of the vapor but I know you've cited a study I'd like to do a little more research on that but I think if if if these products provide a vehicle to help people get off smoking products there may be a public health benefit of that so I think in terms of regulation we do have to be careful to allow people that transition in particularly in their own home their own apartment that might be owned by somebody else I look forward to working with you on that issue thank you mister I'm glad to work on it any other comments or questions from any of the members I have a couple comments and then a statement and then I'll tell you what my position is and what my recommendation would be to the committee senator Monning brought up some good points and I know you and I spoke that your goal was to make sure that there was no public harm with these put this particular product I definitely believe that individuals who are either rental or doing it within the confines of their home own home there should be some type of mechanism to protect them to allow them to do it because now that Connors your argument with regard to the public being at risk so if you have that commitment obviously we're gonna be voting with no amendments I also would like to ask that you work with Senator Monning and that you keep me informed with regard to how that's and I don't know how you would address the hospital situation but I think that's something that's up for discussion at least you know I was conflicted from the standpoint of what is the best public policy and I have seen the documents but more importantly these studies and I steer questionable so I find them but my position has to kind of always lean towards the side of overall public safety and you know it is a I was kind of torn but I'm willing to support the bill because I understand the importance that it is to you as the author and what I would ask is that you continue to give me additional information more importantly additional information on the efficacy and the study and boil and the the toxicity of the product to the public okay and with that did you have a comment senator Nielsen I would just offer now sorry I missed the most recent testimony but I have studied the bill and I do find merit in the general premise but I feel there's some compelling need for some substantial change and I'm just a little reluctant always to vote in committee there was something I'm not totally comfortable enough with so I wrote no today but I thank the author for her willingness to work on it and may different thing when I get to see it in the floor Thank You senator okay yes senator I just had a quick question when you did you actually take a puff of it or did you not take a puff of air or yes I did the way that it's called stealth vaping because this is vapor if you simply hold your breath for about five seconds nothing is released unlike cigarette smoke where you can hold your breath as long as you can but the second you open your mouth you're gonna have a puff of smoke come out so yes being from New Jersey where each cigarette use is banned I stealth vape everywhere that I go aside from perhaps work because I don't want to open up that can of worms but everywhere else I use my e-cigarette in complete violation of New Jersey law and no one ever notices thank you I like candor I hope it's never used as evidence in courts I was kidding if that's the case this is being broadcast justification and tape all right seeing no other comments or questions from any of the members do we have a motion I would you like to close so you can make the motion first that's fine senator Wolk moves the bill senator would you like to close first of all let me just say thank you to everyone who came today to speak in fact I am you probably think this strange but I'm very happy that you're here it's great that we have a process that people care enough to come to the building and voice their concerns so I appreciate you all being here even though we might not necessarily agree on everything let me just say a few things I want to just speak a little bit more about the study really quick and then and then close so members we do know that nicotine is addictive there are health risks and there are health risks with electronic cigarettes as well as cigarettes there's there's no doubt to that conclusion vapor may be invisible vapor you may not exhale but eventually you do because you continue to breathe so the problem is there is the possibility for health concerns and health risks and that's that's why I'm here I'm sincere in my concerns as well the study itself just to coat it just a little bit more the one that I quoted which is a University study and I think members when you look at studies we do need to take a look and see who Commission's them we need to see whether it's a university study or maybe it's commissioned by an industry that does make a difference sometimes on the results so the University study does say that all of the elements an electronic cigarette aerosol can adversely affect the respiratory system while some also affect reproduction and development and some are carcinogens and just go on to briefly paraphrase the next sentence basically it states that these items are present in the vapor so there is that information I am glad to continue to work on this issue of scenarios where perhaps Public Health will not be affected I do have to say I am continue to be concerned that Public Health can even be affected in an apartment situation but based on the testimony I heard today by all the witnesses and my conversations with Senator Monning I'm glad to work on that because I can understand that there is a concern and a need but I want to make it very clear this is not a bill that bans the use of e-cigarettes and I have never carried a bill that banned the use of e-cigarettes I did carry a bill and it's cited in your analysis that's what's great about analysis it tells the history I did carry a bill a couple of years ago let me just it's on page five at number five that was SB 882 it was chaptered its law and this law made it unlawful to for to sell or furnish electronic cigarettes to persons under 18 so that mirrors you know the the smoking laws because of our concern for addiction for young people which I understand obviously you're concerned about as well so that's the law that I worked on previously so I just want to correct you that's the law that's the history that's what's there so well well it is correct it is correct so with that members might appreciate your aye vote thank you very much we have SB 648 Corbett it is due pass to judiciary call the members Hernandez all right Hernandez aye Anderson no Anderson no Belle de Leon DeSaulnier this on your eye Monning aye Monning aye Nielsen no Nielsen no happily well well I that currently is for tattoo there's some members absent we're gonna put that bill on call and we'll lift that call when they return thank you very much mr. chair and members thank you we have a senator Huff SB 669 item number 8 emergency medical care and epinephrine auto-injectors Thank You mr. chairmembers anaphylaxis is a severe whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that's become an allergen according to recent medical studies anaphylaxis allergic reactions are responsible for 1,500 deaths a year in the United States an epinephrine auto-injector the EpiPen is a medical device used to deliver a measured dose of epinephrine using auto injector technology it's used for treatment of acute allergic reactions to avoid or treat the onset of anaphylaxis Senate bill 669 enables California to join a growing group of states that provide training in the proper use of epi pens by making these auto injectors available by prescriptions to individuals pre-hospital emergency medical care person first responder or lay rescue who successfully completed specified training and certification death from anaphylaxis remains a real and widespread problem and under current law there's no effective treatment to prevent anaphylaxis cardiac arrest unless the victim has an EpiPen and as I've able to self administer the injection before losing consciousness the purpose of SB 669 is to increase the chances that if a person suffers a life-threatening allergic reaction there will be someone close by with an epinephrine auto-injector and without facing civil liability for trying to save a life I do have some witnesses here today and ask for your consideration thank you very much please state your name in your position Larry Doyle on behalf of the conference of California Bar Association's with the sponsors of the bill SB 669 would enable California to grow it join a growing group of states which make training available in the proper use and administration of epinephrine auto-injectors make the auto injectors available by prescription to individuals who have completed this training so it can increase the chances of that a person suffers the life-threatening allergic reaction there will be somebody close by with an auto injector who knows the proper way to use it and will be willing to do so or can assist in the self administration of that it's a good bill it's not a broad bill but it's very helpful potentially and helping to save lives and we ask your support for it Thank You anyone else in support lawyer I'm a scout volunteer I'm a Red Cross volunteer and instructor also at cert I'm certainly in support of this bill we've got Good Samaritan statutes and recognition that professional and even lay responders cannot always be emergency medical system cannot always respond to every emergency you've got the Good Samaritan statutes for to encourage lay and professional responders to provide this cardiopulmonary resuscitation the administration of an automatic electrical defibrillator device you've got now in schools actually across the nation and now in California enabling legislation that allows school nurses and even teachers to have training in the use of an EpiPen which is by the way little children are this is a consumer product little children carry this around for self administration you've got it now California is joined the other states that allows us to allow teachers and nurses to be trained in the use of an EpiPen and administer it you do not have this for anybody else outside of a professional response you may not be able to have a timely response to somebody in anaphylaxis where you could die in a matter of minutes I've been around a child that self administered this he got a bee sting and I started seeing him to freaking out knowing that that EpiPen it he's gonna have to self administer was this is gonna be a safety valve if he doesn't get to send correctly he's gonna die because at that point where we were out there in the wilderness there's no way he would have had any of the response had no training in it I couldn't help him but he I could see the fear that he has the pen which was lucky but if he"
jQeD_o-v_Lk,05-21-2014,2726,CA,very much for considering this and and thank you thank you very much that's going to next witness in support mr. chair and members Betsy Armstrong on behalf of the county health executives Association our folks are the County and three City Health Department directors around the state we believe this is a modest approach to essentially what we see is an alarming rise in the use of teenage use of these e-cigarettes and we urge your support thank you thank you do we have a third witness who wishes to speak now okay let's go to public comments and support then hello my name is Kathy Hall I'm a volunteer with the California state parent Teachers Association and we are strongly in support of this bill good morning chairman Gatto and honorable owners of the committee my name is Bernadette Ariano and I represent the California Children's Hospital Association and from a public health standpoint we think this is a very important step forward to prevent children from getting their hands on tobacco products and the urge your strong support thank you andy Katz representing Breathe California in strong support we're very concerned from a health perspective that nicotine addiction can lead to reversion to traditional cigarette use which we know is very dangerous to the public health thank you for your support hello members Cali hampt on behalf of the American Heart and American Stroke Association we are in a supportive amended position on this bill to prevent the potential negative public health impacts of e-cigarettes we strongly support laws and regulations that prohibit the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes to youth including e-cigarettes and smoke-free laws and in the definition of tobacco products the definition of e-cigarettes and this smell is inadequate and we feel that it can be better be defined and look forward to continuing to work with the author on this amendment in a future policy committee thank you good morning Tim Gibbs with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and we also have a support if amended position for the same reasons we'd like to see a more accurate and broader definition of e cigarettes to be sure that cigarette manufacturers and tobacco companies can't escape proper regulation by seeking to define e cigarettes in the niche markets so for those reasons we are supportive amended hi Lindsay Freitas with the American Lung Association also support if amended for all the reasons that heart and cancer specified Nicole were tlemen on behalf of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in support any other public comment in support i let's other witnesses in opposition step forward to the Dyess or the table rather than whatever it's called good morning my name is Jim root I am with California vapor association we're an industry group representing retailers and ejuice manufacturers first of all I'd like to point out some assumptions in the wording of this bill that'll likely face litigation and litigation challenges and possibly get it repealed completely there are several mentions of e-cigarettes being a public health hazard the wording obviously taken directly from anti-smoking regulations though there have been many studies that show there is no secondhand affect of vaping so to characterize this as a public health hazard is inappropriate whatever effects vaping has on the user do not translate to anyone around them my other concern on this bill is the undue financial pressure it will put on the businesses and the consumers this action will likely send businesses to other states and consumers looking to buy their products from unscrupulous dealers should there be a penalty for selling to minors absolutely should we find a way to hold both online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores accountable yes we support the no sales to minors regulation but we want to see it have a true impact and not just give it lip service in fact we're currently searching for legislators that'll is willing to go one step further and create a separate licensing program under the tobacco statute for vape shops and a juice manufacturers this would allow us to include stiff penalties for selling to children even to the point of closing their business a licensing program would allow the state to monitor these businesses and put it under the umbrella of tobacco enforcement where the local authorities are currently doing a great job investigating unscrupulous retailers to sell tobacco products to kids let's not waste our time on creating laws that have no tangible effect on protecting kids let's do this right the first time thank you Kris Khan representing VMR products were the makers of v2 electronic cigarettes we are opposed we had been working with the author's office on amendments as it came out of Geo committee we thought those amendments were going to focus on the front end of the process we support a verification we think that's done properly at the at the front end at the time of sale the bill includes a back end secondary age verification as well that we feel is unworkable at cost to the product and is an inconvenience to our customer we also think the bill is a little premature given the fact that the FDA is embarking on their regulatory scheme for this industry and we look forward to no vote thank you it's good of public I'm sorry other other my name is Sally ketch I am a nonsmoker I have never smoked a cigarette or anything else I married a smoker who had smoked since his teens he has now quit smoking due to electronic cigarettes I believe that a B 1500 is a solution in search of a problem 20% of teens smoke tobacco cigarettes only 10% of teens have ever tried an e-cigarette if you look at the teens who are non-smokers that drops to about 2 or 3 percent we have no statistics on the number of teens who have actually purchased or even attempted to purchase these cigarettes online I do believe that it is worth verifying the age of purchasers at the time of purchase I don't think anyone should sell e-cigarettes to minors marijuana sales in any form in person online to anyone of any age without a prescription are illegal already and are not relevant to this bill however age verification at the time of delivery while pretty much irrelevant if you are buying a $200 shipment of wine are burdensome when added to a 16 dollar bottle of illiquid I oppose this bill I urge this committee to oppose this bill which will be impossible to enforce will not deter teens from using e-cigarettes and we'll send business out of state causing loss of jobs loss of sales tax revenue increase of products imported from out-of-state or overseas and a possible increase of the number of people who return to smoking from using e-cigarettes thank you thank you I do are there any other witnesses you wish to testify or public comment David Quintana on behalf of njoy incorporated we we are opposed to the bill but first of all I need to say that enjoy is opposed to selling these products to minors and we already implement third party a Jura fication on the front end of these sales we attempted to work work amendments out with this author over and over since the bill has moved out of Geo I think we have offered some very sensible solutions which would well currently the way the bill is written it makes it a de facto prohibition on us selling our products by requiring the the age verification at the door so if we can move back remove that as we have asked over and over I think we can we could move forward but until that happens we have to ask that that you oppose this bill any public comment in opposition seeing none Department of Finance mr. chair and members finance is neutral on the bill and notes that it may prevent access to e-cigarettes through the internet and telephone sales by minors thank you other questions or comments from the panel mr. Bigelow question mr. dick to the author let's start just follow the trail first question federal drug included administration how already is promulgating the rules prohibiting the sale of electronic cigarettes do we really need the bill and thanks for that question mr. mr. Bigelow in fact what what the FDA has done is proposed regulations I think we are we are all aware of two things one it takes a heck of a long time to get federal regulations if we ever get them and two they are very likely subject to change through the process of considering regulations so it is indeed possible that someday the federal government will in fact promulgate regulations which would address this subject but unless on until they do which is far from a certainty it makes sense for us in California to take action to protect our young people and given the fact that these federal rules are supposed to be finalized this summer does that change your mind in any way about your bill because it appears that these are going to be finalized on the federal side if they are finalized I will applaud the federal government for doing that if if that were to happen that this summer it would set a national record for the adoption of regulations I believe them when they say they think they're gonna do that but let me just express my skepticism okay I've got that part next question can you address the concerns that were raised by the last speaker in opposition with respect to making it in well making it so that they can't even sell the product yes I don't understand that that argument frankly what the argument is here as I understand it is that what's acceptable to the opponents is to take information about about age and the like at the time the order is placed when there's when there's no ability to see who's providing that information and yet there's an objection to obtaining a signature of an adult when the product is delivered as is required for tobacco products and for alcohol today now I gather from what I've heard although it wasn't expressed directly here that the on workable part of of this is that somehow the amount of purchase of e-cigarettes is not significant enough in dollars to to make it worthwhile when you have to add on a charge that is is levied by the by the deliver and connection with that I don't know how many of these sales are of a 5 or 10 or $15 nature but that same requirement applies to alcohol and it applies to tobacco so there's no distinction that I see in in this case among the three products we're talking about maybe it would bear some clarification by the maker of that question because it seems a little bit confusing so if you could yeah absolutely first of all we're not tobacco there is no tobacco and e-cigarettes you're not going to take five drags on an e-cigarette and then go drive your car wrong lay down the freeway so please make sure you don't compare each cigarette to alcohol and tobacco they are very different products right now most people when they purchase a cigarette they want to try out the different the different you know the different makers of different manufacturers and so they do go onto the Internet what mr. Dickinson would do is force everybody who wants to implement some sort of harm reduction strategy to their current smoking is to go to the convenience store and face the great wall of tobacco at the convenience store as they try to as I try to you know purchase their e-cigarettes so what what the reason I said it's approach it is a de facto prohibition on us selling is because most of our products are like $5.99 $6.99 most of the people order one or two at a time they don't order like they order wine which are usually two to three hundred dollars ups would charge us five dollars to ship that product thereby you're doubling the cost of our product making us not able to compete mr. chairman your indulgence of course I don't want to extend this debate too long but I want to make two points here first of all v2 cigs already requires an adult signature upon delivery for theirs their so-called starter kit they're doing that already so if we're talking about people who are testing it out that's what they're doing today and secondly as v2 cigs set in a Forbes magazine in October of 2013 sales in 2012 or 80% online for for e-cigarettes but that the person representing the company interviewed said sales would be less than 50% of the business in in the immediate future because online is retracting because retail is growing even faster so walls of cigarettes if people want to get you cigarettes let them get cigarettes they're not going to be deterred by walking into their local brick and mortar retailer where the sales tax stays here as opposed to going online that does assume they have a local brick and mortar retailer I just want the witnesses and you know if you are asked a question you can feel free to pipe in there if they vice chair to address the question about the delivering agent so when an item is ordered take us through the steps of who's responsible for validating that the person is 18 years old you have somebody who says they're 18 somehow they have to approve they're 18 when ordering take me through the steps of the chain of actions so so when you place an order online you would be asked various questions to ascertain age and that is that is the front end verification that the opponents are talking about that is what we have in the bill what we have have added is simply that when the product is delivered when possession is taken by the recipient the person who ordered there has to be an adult that signs for it at that point because that's the only point at which you have face to face verification that you're delivering it to somebody of age is that any different than any other product that is shipped that requires an aged sir person of adult age to sign for it's essentially the same it's the same procedure if you're if you're buying alcohol or you're buying tobacco when you go online that there's supposed to be verification of age at the front end although it is not done very rigorously research shows and then a signature is required of a dolt of an adult at the point of delivery who is responsible is it the entity that delivered it whether it be post office or some other entity that delivers by vehicles to a person's residence or is it the manufacturer or their place of origin of sale it's it's the respond at the point of delivery yes it's the responsibility of the delivery agent to obtain the signature okay that's that's their responsibility thank you okay I believe we have a few more questions members who wish to ask questions going to mr. ridley-thomas followed by mr. quirk and then dr. pan mr. Dickinson seems like a part of this challenge that you're trying to address us to deal with the use of marijuana each cigarettes and vaping what is your position on marijuana and it's non medicinal uses and the like this bill doesn't address marijuana well I think that a part of the usage that we see with younger people has to do with the usage of marijuana I think that's acknowledged it's acknowledged in one of your witnesses letters that was given to us and kind of popular conversation about the product being do you appreciate that maybe if we focused on marijuana the debt would get to some of the concerns about youth usage and the like mr. ridley-thomas this bill addresses e-cigarettes this does not address marijuana whatever the connections others may make between marijuana and ecig retsoor connections they make is this this is confined to e-cigarettes if they use the paraphernalia for other purposes and a cigarette that's something they do all we are all we are addressing here is in the integrity of making sure that is an adult who receives the e-cigarettes and not a minor now this bill is currently silent on components versus fully contained each cigarettes correct this this bill uses the definition that is in existing law that that says electronic cigarette means a device that can provide an inhalable dose of nicotine by delivering a vaporized solution I think that's inclusive of components as well I'm not sure that the the analysis or legal analysis suggests the same and that may be an update on the definition is appropriate we've discussed the FDA forthcoming regulations in the leg it seems to me that this measure is a bit premature toward that effort I understand I think what you're trying to get at you told me about your intent but this seems to be a ahead of where we are and I don't know that it gets to the root because my concern is frankly the use of marijuana by minors I you know those I have a significant concern about it as well but from my observation that's a bigger challenge with respect to e-cigarettes so today I won't be able to support the bill mr. quirk mr. Dickinson I'm going to be supporting the bill you've done a great job answering all the questions in the bills original form I couldn't support it because I felt it would ban internet sales even to adults but in this form I think it's great look I'm a big supporter of medical marijuana anything that would interfere with medical marijuana using these devices I would be opposed to this does not do it someone has a problem being at home during the day they can certainly go to retailers this does not keep these devices out of the hands of adults but it is extremely important to keep them out of the hands of children look teenagers have immature brains they shouldn't be smoking marijuana they shouldn't be smoking they shouldn't be using these as nicotine delivery systems I suspect dr. pan will have more to say on this thank you for this bill thank you very much dr. pan thank you certainly I have exactly I do share those concerns about exposure to nicotine and other substances and in adolescent and child brains that's a big issue so I think that does lead to my question which has to do it actually that the definition of cigarettes in fact I know that may the public health folks and the Cancer Society lung xiety and so forth are concerned about the definition are actually the narrowness of the definition of e-cigarettes and that in fact that that's something that tobacco companies your allies are actually using to try to undermine regulations by the FDA that are skirt those definitions and so I know that they have proposed terms language to broaden the definition to actually to be sure we have an inclusive definition to be sure that we're not actually carrying the water for tobacco companies and their strategy to try to actually avoid regulation the e-cigarettes so are you committed to making those kind of changes to your bill so to be sure that we actually have a bill that's not a Trojan horse for tobacco companies well let's be let's be clear about this we are using the definition that exists in state law today those who sell e-cigarettes have asked for a change in the in the definition in a way which I presume they believe would be beneficial to them though such as heart and cancer have asked for a change in the definition in a way that they believe would be more protective of public health if you were here earlier you would have heard heart and cancer testified that they support this bill if amended and would like to see it continue to move so we can have the discussion about hopefully arriving at a definition if we're going to change it that that will be acceptable and will protect public health I take second place - no one - no one in my time spent protecting children and public health so I more than happy to make a commitment to this committee that that will be a foremost consideration as this legislation moves forward so just to follow up so this is a commitment to to burn your language as suggested by cancer among and so forth the public health and the legislative process will take its course any other questions or comments from the panel mr. ridley-thomas has a follow up followed by mr. Holden mr. Dickinson in light of your comments about public health and the like to the chair of the Health Committee on which I said why wouldn't this bill seen before the Health Committee why we've been hurt by the health why was it not heard by the Health Committee I don't sit on the Rules Committee I don't make me I I can I can just state that the bill was referred to I believe government organization around and then here and that's it and that's a decision made back in December if and and I just to try to answer mr. ridley-thomas question mr. Chairman I was informed that the bills with this subject matter have liyan historically always go into government operations thank you I ask that it be referred to health mr. Holden mr. Dickerson I appreciate what you're you're you're trying to get out and I believe that there's merit to your bill I believe that there's been some clear and in very important issues raised that would continue to present hurdles to the ultimate success of your bill I view quite frankly if this was a policy committee if this were health then I think that many of my concerns I would sort of tag on to with many of those who spoke in terms of some of the other issues that are underlining here it's a fiscal committee I will support your bill out of committee today but that by no means as a guarantee that I will support it based more on the merits obviously of the policy as it's presented on the floor but I do think that the what I've heard is there's a common link here in arguments were even the opponents and you and your proponents are on the same page and relationship to protecting minors and and I think that that is ultimately the goal how it is ultimately wordsmith and defined and framed there's still some work to be done so having at least shared that with you and those who have spoken both in favor and opposed that's where I stand today thank you any other questions or comments miss compass just one and I know that mr. pan had addressed this as well and and I listening to Assemblymember Holden's comments and I know this is a fiscal committee and I listened to the witnesses as they came up in support and one of the things that kept coming up and I understand that you know policy will evolve as the bills evolved through a process here but one of the things even from the opponents and from your supporters the definition kept coming up and I know that after it leaves this committee and it it goes to the floor and depending on what happens there that at some point do you anticipate that that will be an item that you will address I am perfectly happy to try to arrive at a revised definition that works and is protective of public health it's a difficult subject and the as I mentioned the proponents and opponents have different ideas about how the definition should be changed that doesn't that doesn't mean that I will give up in efforts to try to find that common ground that meets the criteria of protecting public health and is and is sufficiently clear it is the reason why we have not addressed the we didn't take up the issue of the definition the definition is in state law as it exists today so if it's going to be changed it should be changed as a result of a dialogue that that comes to an agreement and I'm committed to to that well thank you for for being Frank about your position I appreciate that thank you any other questions or comments seeing them would you like to close actually before you close I'll make my comments people noticed of course that I don't have a recommendation recommendation on this bill and I know that in this committee were often asked to consider a wide range of bills that have gone through the policy process and find themselves on our lap for whatever reason a lot of the discussion of course in this committee has to do with the fiscal and we typically engage in a cost-benefit analysis we we have to look at the wide variety of things in terms of even if a bill doesn't cost much an indirect state costs what the benefit is this bill and from my conversations with a number of members is a little bit vexing to them because I'm you know they're considering everything from the loss of potential sales tax and the loss of potential commerce and the effect on the state to whether or not this this hurts a nascent industry the direct estate costs are that we in our analysis however are minor and you know I personally will be voting aye on this bill I have not given a recommendation to the rest of committee because I know that there's a lot of members with very strong opinions on this and but that's where things stand so I'm you know close mr. chairman thank you I appreciate this wide-ranging policy discussion we've had this morning and the Appropriations Committee and in closing I just want to note that the Centers for Disease Control report each cigarette use has doubled among middle and high school students between 2011 and 2012 that is in one single year this month the Legacy Foundation survey found 14 percent of those 14 to 17 and 39% of those 18 to 21 had tried an e-cigarette this is obviously something that's gaining gaining traction we're trying to take a small step here to protect our young people and we will continue to work to find that happy meeting place on this legislation but give us a chance to do that please I asked respectfully for an aye vote is there a motion on assembly bill 1500 so moved Bill's been moved and seconded madam secretary we have a request from both sides for a full roll so please call them all got him I got her I Bigelow to the author I thank you for the responses to my questions unfortunately you didn't quite get all the answers that I needed

Holden Holden aye Jones Linder pan quote I vote aye and look forward to they'll change in language pan aye quirk aye quirk aye really Thomas really Thomas no Wagner Weber aye Weber I write that bill is on call thanks very much yeah so we have next on our agenda is mr. Chesbro all right mr. Chesbro you have you have window before us which is in our suspense file it's Assembly Bill 2035 I assume by your presence here that you wish to present on it the floor is yours Thank You mr. chair I present to you a B 2035 which establishes a state plan Shh to serve commercially and sexually exploited children and alliance current policies to better meet this populations needs currently in the state of California services for this population are lacking and children are often being arrested for crimes that their traffickers forced them to commit in order for them to receive any services or support a B 2035 will help provide better care for all minor victims of human trafficking by providing the victim services through the juvenile dependency system additionally the bill provides for interagency protocols for responding and serving these children through a multidisciplinary approach traffic children need to be recognized as victims and be provided services through a system designed to protect abused abandoned and sexually assaulted children not a system for children who have committed crimes while California has strengthened its efforts to combat human trafficking a statewide comprehensive approach has yet to be enacted to assist and protect abandoned children I have with me Kate Walker staff attorney for the National Center for youth law and Brenda Dabney from the children's Law Center of California this bill has a long list of supporters and no opposition welcome thank you for being here and first witness may just fine thank you good morning my name is Kate Walker I'm an attorney at the National Center for youth law in Oakland we advocate on behalf of low-income children and I specifically focus on commercially sexually exploited children we strongly support AV 2035 to serve CSEC the it stands for commercially sexually exploited children a B 2035 is a critical step towards more effectively and appropriately serving this vulnerable population through the victim centered approach as Assemblymember Chesbro said traditionally these children have been served to the juvenile justice system of punitive system that does not account for their needs and and their complex trauma legislation as a recognition that children bought and sold her sex on a daily basis and exposed to unimaginable trauma are victims of abuse and neglect it also recognizes the need to build capacity now these children are victims of repeated sexual abuse and they should be served through a system designed to support and serve them youth who have endured complex trauma require intensive individualized services and supports this necessitates specially trained social workers mentors and systems to wrap services around them this proposal would address these needs and begin equipping the child welfare system as well as the other child serving systems throughout the state to better serve these children for these reasons we respectfully urge you to support a be 20:35 thank you thank you very much any other witnesses in support yes Brenda Dabney with the children's Law Center of California we all recognize that what an adult uses a child for sex it's child abuse the children's Law Center of California in both Los Angeles County and Sacramento County represents thousands of children who have come in to the child welfare system because of sexual abuse however if an adult pays for the sex it's no longer considered child abuse the child is criminalized and not offered support or services of the child welfare system under current law this bill seeks to correct this by making it clear that these children are victims of sexual abuse this is a child welfare problem in fact studies have estimated that as many as 80% of sex trafficking victims have come from former involvement in the foster care system as a director of the children's Law Center here in our Sacramento office one of my most heartbreaking parts of my day is to sit with some of my staff attorneys after they've come from juvenile hall to talk to me about having spent hours in the hall with a young girl sometimes as young tiny producer as well as a performer I can't pay for other people's tests when I shoot I often film couples in reality porn where they don't use condoms in their own personal life but because we're making this production available to the public to enjoy which it's not sex ed if it were sex ed it would be pornography would be put in fifth and sixth grade classes not because it's for adult entertainment and if you want to educate the public about sexual health and stuff maybe do it like cigarette packs were at the beginning of the pornography we all say I was tested maybe you should be too to know your status because this doesn't address blood-borne pathogens I also got to make sure that all the other people who came a long way can for a big long list of reasons I I thank you all right please again just state your name and where you're from I've been told to state my name I am James Patrick Getchell Patrick J Knight this is forced consent I guess that's all I'm allowed to say good morning committee chair admin my name is Wray Ruchi I'm a performer I am NOT a prostitute I will be a law student in August and I may be serving on the San Francisco civil grand jury I have a number of points against this bill basically prohibition doesn't work the Volstead Act was very well intentioned but it created a lot of havoc in the United States and had to be repealed this bill is it purports to be a safety bill but it's really prohibiting a form of the porn industry that that's very popular bareback porn is basically a concept that drives a lot of the industry people seek these vendors they want to see it a safe consensual realistic sex act that's not related to the way they have sex at home this is this bill if it passes is going to create economic havoc devastating the tax base is going to seriously undermine HIV prevention efforts for example if this bill passes the tax base drops imagine if temp you know I don't mean to interrupt but we've heard that point we would appreciate you making it and thank you so much for being a there's a big line of people who want to speak one more point of wanting to make if I'm sorry I'm sorry there's a long a lot of people who need to be heard we want to make sure that their voices are heard as well so let's go to our next next public comment in opposition thank you thank you hello my stage name is pink and I oppose this bill hello my name is Joshua diamond I've worked in the adult film industry for 11 years I'm not a performer I'm a videographer cameraman photographer I work behind the scenes but all of my dearest friends work in the industry as performers or have at some point and so this bill affects them differently than me but there is one thing that we all have in common we are not employees we are private contractors that do a job I personally have about seven different companies that I work for and which one of them is supposed to pay for the performers tests when the performer is working for 12 different companies this month which company should pay it moving really isn't an option for me my son is first cello in his orchestra you know and I can't exactly drive out of state every single day to go to work it's just not feasible three of my three my main three clients have told me that if this bill passes I can either move to wherever they go pack up my children pack up their mother pack up everything and make us all start over or I can lose them as clients and go back to construction one last point if this bill passes the only one who's really gonna benefit is u-haul because we're all gonna be moving thank you thank you very much hi my name is Emma Claire I am an independent performer I am also an HIV and STI coordinator at the st. James infirmary which is a occupational and safety health clinic for sex workers including adult film performers I just want to say that I oppose this the it is a waste of resources and it is a constitutional violation of performers rights thank you okay and just a friendly reminder as I sit at the outside of this hearing and we traditionally allow witnesses to speak we've had roughly six witnesses on each side there's a whole lot of people in line I know you want to be heard I know you came out an awful long way we want to do that but we also have another 60 or so bills on the agenda this morning with an equal number of witnesses so just to make sure that everybody gets a chance to speak on all the different Bill's please just state your name where you're from and whether you oppose or support the bill thank you hello my name is dan font oil and I oppose this bill because of all that it will do to violate the
